Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they might give the impression that they are "puppets"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they were suggested to change their title, respectively to be called MWP (members of the Parliament of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly within the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party within the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that they are "timing with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "faecal matter".
A member of the Wales Party within the National Assembly of Wales said that overall, the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member said the group has a "open" attitude towards name change, but that it also noticed that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales just like the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said, "The final decision on how members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the respective members themselves."
The 2017 Law on the Government of Wales gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the "Parliament of Wales".
Regarding the title of members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the option "MWP" received the most votes in the public consultation.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales seem to have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give Elin Jones, chairman of the governing committee, who is expected to send the amendment bill within weeks.
Reform legislation will include further changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee's system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote for referendum on country name change
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will voice their opinion on changing their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was held to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens government has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a claim concerning its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would disregard the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is only a compromise that will allow him to join the EU and NATO.
Bells of St. Martin's Episcopal Church stopped ringing as a result of problems faced by churches in Harlem
"Historically, veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you found a bar and a church at every street corner," Adams said.
"Today, there are no bars and no churches."
He also said that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize differently today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the role of living room for the entire neighborhood, where people normally gather."
And as far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expect and that, "sooner or later, the outcome will be the same".
He added that churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who would not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "therefore this will speed up the closing of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches".
Both churches were built by congregations made up of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African American people – St. Martin's Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist congregation, consisting of white people, moved out of the area after 1930.
A congregation of African American people, who were conducting their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation of African Americans, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted traders on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who were opposed to hiring or promoting African American people.
A fire that occurred in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in these.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's church, called the carillon "the bells of poor people".
The expert who put the carillon into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stated that it was the world's first carillon acted by an African American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to a larger carillon, at Riverside church, 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it was not replaced at St. Martin's.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The sacristy, the parish governing entity, consisting of deacons, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency shown by the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old trying to catch lobsters in California
According to authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child, while he was swimming, trying to catch lobsters, in California, on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m., near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming for about half an hour, alongside his friends, on the morning of Saturday, when he heard a little boy screaming for help and that he then moved along with a group that helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel also stated that he initially thought the boy was excited about catching a lobster, but then realized he was yelling "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The entire clavicle was torn apart, Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
"I cried out to all those who were in the water and told them to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it was not a species of shark that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper torso.
authorities restricted access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and safety reasons .
Giles also noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury retailer plans to strengthen its position on the UK beauty and fashion market
Sainsbury takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing districts with beauty products in the style of a department store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a position-building in the UK beauty products market, worth £2.8 billion, which continues to increase, although domestic and fashion sales are not to match, the larger beauty product districts will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be integrated into several stores in the next year if they prove successful.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Retailer Sainsbury's representatives said the number of beauty products they offer would be doubled, reaching up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunches its makeup range, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, an increasingly common demand among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two stores of the Sainsbury chain, for testing purposes, the first being the one opened last week in Croydon, in south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of retailer Sainsbury, said the outlets would increasingly look like department stores, as supermarket chains are trying to cope with the fight with major discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores and Habitats, since it purchased both chains two years ago, meaning it recorded increases in food sales as well as increased profit.
The supermarket's previous attempt to refresh its pharmaceutical and beauty compartments failed.
Sainsbury attempted to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ceased after a divergence on how to split Boots stores' revenue into its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business which included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmaceutical chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
This means Lloyds will have an important role within the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of retailer Sainsbury said: "We have transformed the appearance of our districts with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations turn us into an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract
TV protagonist "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11 million contract with his lifestyle company, to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their project on the Truly brand, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
Presenter of the 37-year-old "This Morning", announced on Instagram that she would retire.
Holly Willoughby generated the anger of Peter Jones, the protagonist of "Dragons‘ Den", withdrawing at the last minute from their business offering lifestyle services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones reportedly became enraged when one of the most beloved people in television admitted on Tuesday, during a tense sitting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, no longer allow her to devote herself to their brand, Truly, which includes accessories and household items.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and would almost have doubled Willoughby's fortune, with an estimated £11 million.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would give up his contract for Truly, Jones left Britain, to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
One source's statement: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to retire shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was just a little while before the launch.
There is a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the show's presenter "This Morning", which is among the UK's best-selling stars, could harm the company millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing items and household items, as well as the possible further delay in the launch.
It can also represent the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established the Truly brand with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as director in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A close source of Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his affairs".
We were very harsh, and then "we fell in love"
He made jokes at the expense of critics he would receive from journalists for making a comment some would consider "unworthy of a president" and on the fact that he has such a positive attitude regarding the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Said Trump imitating a voice of "newscaster" .
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim was interested in having another meeting after the initial Singapore meeting in June was described by Trump as an enormous step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have ceased.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not noticed a "appropriate response" from the United States regarding previous disarmament steps by North Korea.
Instead, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on this.
Trump had a more optimistic view in his motivational speech.
"Everything is going well as far as North Korea is concerned," he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending missile tests, support for the release of hostages, and the return of U.S. military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to behave like a president, but if I were to behave like this, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to enter this uncommitted arena, there would be around 200 people," Trump said, pointing to the crowd that was in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia ravaged an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok Island has been deployed, no national disaster has been declared, a condition needed to trigger relief actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very clear about not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit of a difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the "Save the Children" foundation attempts to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said authorities in Indonesia are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to relief efforts.
Given the constant earthquakes borne by Indonesia, it is unbelievable that the country continues to be insufficiently prepared for nature's fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not found very often on other coasts.
It seems that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning has been issued to this effect, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, travel between the islands of Indonesia turns out to be a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate this.
A hospital ship that has stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site where the new calamity occurred.
President Joko Widodo set out that improving poor infrastructure in Indonesia would be the focus of his election campaign and he has extraordinarily allocated money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from sectants in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands deployed from their homes, as gangs of Christians and Muslims brawled in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks save goal and equals score in match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute, Saturday, at London's Stamford Bridge football stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while about 30 metres from the opposing team gate, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a shot in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached above the square, heading to the top right corner of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards it and fell into the goal.
"I just had to try to get into the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to move forward as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, I just picked up the ball further."
Chelsea led 1-0 at half time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Blue team striker sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned to midfield and ran to Liverpool's half field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went into the square.
Hazard overcame the defense and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and pass Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Death toll from Indonesian tsunami at 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on Sunday morning.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and that triggered waves up to 6 metres, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
The town of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000 people, was covered by debris caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of stabbing a woman
A murder investigation was started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The woman, 44, was found at 7:55 a.m., with stab wounds, at Grayson Mews, on John Street, and a man suspected of murder was arrested.
Police asked people in the area who heard or saw something related to this subject to come to the station for statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I appeal to all the people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who have heard or seen anything suspicious contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material with the help of the camera on board to contact us if they have information essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a woman in Birkenhead and that it was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the crime scene who believe they knew the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police have said they are trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
People living in the building were told it would be a few more hours before they were allowed in.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene, a woman in tears presented herself.
He kept repeating "it's so awful!".
At 2 p.m., two police vans were on the perimeter and another one was outside it.
Several police officers were sitting in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment building.
Any person with information is asked to send a direct message to police @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at telephone number 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue at Parliament becomes the latest commemorative monument affected by altercations on "rewriting history"
Removing it would represent a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by his fanatical Puritan descendants.
But Cromwell society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither commissioned nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would sacrifice a wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor Thomas from the previous century.
Cromwell's magnificent depiction, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure which many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is accurate representation, this is the subject of continuous historical debate.
But certainly, the mid-17th century conflict prompted the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which represents part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve celebration and commemoration."
A pig caused the death of a Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only by the surname "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was severed and covered in blood, near a pig farm in the market in Liupanshui, in Guizhou Province, according to Sunday's editorial of the Morning Post in South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pigs' vaccines on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
Apparently he had come with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a neighbouring henhouse was open.
It stated that there was a large-sized male pig with blood on his mouth in the henhouse.
Coroner doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered in blood and torn apart," the cousin, whose last name is "Wu", told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the square at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the man's death did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was imprisoned to prevent him from attacking someone else, while police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have also been reports of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and these husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and chase the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that blood taste can trigger such reactions."
"It's just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them the proper respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa, who has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwestern United States
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing intensity as it moves towards colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday, from 5 a.m. and has been located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression zone has begun to form across the Pacific Ocean and is moving east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push intense tropical humidity from the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity that will interact with the depression zone will generate heavy rains in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste streams and possibly landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is expected between 5 and 10 cm in the southwestern part, especially in most Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to conditions of rapid deterioration due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will locally bring winds into gusts and dust.
The nearing depression zone will bring torrential rains to areas on the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of nearly 2 cm is possible, which could cause minor flows of residues and slippery roads.
These will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on the second part of Sunday and the first part of Monday, before rain spreads more Monday night and Tuesday.
The intense rainfall will spread into the so-called "four corners" on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature changes in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in short-distance temperature.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered at the level of the central US area.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. area is expected to face a warm early October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in extensive areas, from the southern plains to certain portions of the northeast.
On Tuesday, the city of New York City could reach 27 degrees, about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of above average temperatures for the eastern US by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the press statement supported by the supreme court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting Friday's normal schedule for breaking news: an agreement reached between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the allegations, for a week.
Ford told the court board that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh harassed her while he was intoxicated and that he tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said that he is 100% sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including the PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a play-off football game or Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place, with a number of viewers of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was watched by 3.1 million people, NBC of 2.94 million, MSNBC of 2.89 million, and CNN of 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and he was trying to get on an elevator at a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He stood looking down for several minutes as people scolded him, and everything was being broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
He was told, "You have power, while so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Television later aired live voting on the Judicial Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for Senate voting.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to analyze the charges against the nominee next week, which minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was largely convinced of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards.
Flake's election was an important one, it being evident that Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of "political games" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview for the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May, UK Prime Minister, attended the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that is next to the one accompanied by his photograph on the front page of the newspaper, the former Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, issued an attack on her plan for Brexit, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal for Britain and the European Union to collect their mutual tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of shooting LSU player dead
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the deadly shooting of Wayde Sims, the 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities published footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the skirmish.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Bureau of Forensic Medicine published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that the death was caused by a head shot through the neck.
The department gives credit to the Louisiana police force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and citizens in the area, for the help provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked police for "diligence and the search for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m tall striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he scored an average of 5.6 points and had 2.6 recoveries.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team was "devastating" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"This worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano dropped an ash column over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital city of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned citizens of Mexico on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after activity was triggered in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several rumblings and vibrations.
The images on social networks featured thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists observed an increase in volcano activity that is 72 km from the southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook downtown Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Riot between police and Catalan separatists before independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes, on the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession vote, gathering thousands of opposing demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away by gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The brawl intensified later, with police using their batons to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We don't forget, we don't forgive", while Union protesters shouted "Long live Spain!".
14 people received medical attention for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain at a high level in the region wishing to become independent one year after the referendum on 1 October was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters chose, in an overwhelming majority, to become independent, although turnout was low, and those against secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling centres in the region, with violent skirmishes taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday night, to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year I had some of the best moments of my life.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they could vote, but now there's nothing we can do," he said.
Despite achieving a vital but close victory, in the December regional elections last year, the Catalan pro-independent parties tried to maintain momentum this year, with many of the most famous leaders either in their own exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said politicians on both sides fuelled the conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"As a candidate in the European elections it is the best way to denounce regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Several men were arrested after driving into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car several times entered a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at approximately 7:30 p.m. on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was caused to the gates and even the building.
It appears that at one point a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's kick helped Livingston win 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston left Rangers without a lineup, with Steven Gerrard reaching his second defeat in 18 games, as manager of the club Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's kick proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team runs out of an away Premier League win this season and faces Hearts leaders, being behind them by eight points next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division up to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat, as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston Misses His Chance Against Cruel Visitors
Holt's team should have moved forward long before they scored, and their orientation caused all sorts of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through and attempted to shoot through the gate space, then Alan Lithgow managed to shoot wide after entering by slip to intercept the ball sent by Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble for visitors at free kicks.
And that was how the crucial void came.
Rangers accepted a free kick, and Livingston managed an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to pass to Menga, who shot and scored from the center of the square.
At that stage, Rangers had dominated possession, but faced impenetrable host defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was no longer in the sea disturbed during the remainder of the match.
This game model continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Allan McGregor of the Rangers, and Lithgow struck a wide blow from another Livingston player.
The diagonal passes continued to come in the Livingston team's square, but unsuccessfully, and the two penalty demands - after Halkett roughed up Glenn Middleton and after a hent - were not accepted.
"The Phenomenal Game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont at BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an ascending trajectory.
Their playing style and team have hardly changed since returning to the top, but the merits must be given to Holt for how he trained his team since he took over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in difficulty throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren't very inspired.
Although they have had good performances since being led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The goal passes were unsuccessful, they only managed once to catch the free opponents' gate, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, who are at the middle of the ranking.
Mixed reactions on Erdogan's visit to Cologne
Everything was pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at remedying relations between NATO allies.
They are dissatisfied over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
Police invoked security grounds to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but quite a few supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, mostly Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him with open arms in the country.
The protests at odds reflect the division of a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies following car collision
A cyclist died after a car collision in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics reported to the crash site, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurs just months after another cyclist died from an accident on Childers Street, in which the driver fled the scene, which is about a mile from where Saturday's crash occurred.
Metropolitan police said the officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted to that area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists were recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured following a skirmish
Six prison officers were injured following a skirmish at a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
On Sunday, a skirmish broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at approximately 9:30, with it in progress.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the skirmish, involving eight inmates, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated at the scene for minor face injuries.
A prison spokesman said, "The assistance of the prison's specialized staff was requested to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical attention after being injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding the responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 detainees, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, the officers in charge of the disturbance were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, with the staff being attacked with pool balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded due to Hurricane Rosa (dry areas may enjoy benefits as a result)
It rarely happens to occur a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week, as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy resources will be used in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western area of Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct trajectory to Phoenix on Tuesday, and on the second part of Monday will cause rainfall.
The National Meteorological Service of Phoenix announced in a Twitter message that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression for a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action over a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Center for Hurricanes forecast rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities ranging from 3 to 5 cm will be recorded, with possible total quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, torrential rain will be beneficial, as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the United States Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona faces at least severe drought, respectively the second largest category," information found on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still had hurricane power on Sunday morning, with a wind of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19 km per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and therefore diminish.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high flood risk.
"Through rains ranging from 8 to 10 cm are expected" from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and can also reach 25 cm," according to weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north, into Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and arriving in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is the extreme torrential rain in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora, and the desert in the southwestern United States," said a representative of the National Center for Hurricanes.
These rains are expected to cause sudden flooding, which will endanger people's lives, and bring waste streams into the deserts, as well as landslides into mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old person was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The officers sought the help of citizens who may have material on their mobile phone, respectively to report to the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced "dissatisfaction and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also stated that Kavanaugh faced "dissatisfaction and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims about sexually harassing her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in court about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw on that day Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage".
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best minds in the legal field of this generation," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm kind of running," he said.
"For this reason, I am expressing my positive opinion everywhere about the candidates that I consider amazing."
Trump claimed the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote at the Senate since Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesia earthquake rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of which were taken by the huge waves that hit the beaches, when a strong earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves six metres high hit the beach at dusk, people being taken by the waters and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still minding their activities on the beach and they did not run immediately, thus becoming victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, BNPB disaster mitigation agency spokesman, in a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami brought with it cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami traveled offshore at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the shoreline.
It added that some people had to climb trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos published by the disaster agency show several buildings and stores destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, aftershocks continued to shake the town on the coast.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday's strong earthquake was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
Perhaps the geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, has intensified the extent of the tsunami, he added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he also said, in addition to the 540 people injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be greater along the 300 km coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely disrupted, with no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added, "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse".
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticised for failing to inform that a tsunami would strike Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In social media postings, one can hear a man on the upper floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching at people on the adjacent street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the material's veracity.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the authorities' rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with aids from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still need food and other basics.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to Palu evacuation centres for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff at Donggala arrived safely in the town of Palu, where employees are accommodated in improvised shelters in the office yard, they passed devastating scenes, said Diseba.
It added, "They told me they saw many houses destroyed".
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups began to start disaster relief actions, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesia regulations, financial resources, material delivery and personnel can only reach the site of a calamity if it is declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a province-wide disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government will say, "Yes, this is a national disaster", we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet."
After the second night of Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing hoped that loved ones would be miraculously rescued from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue personnel released a woman who had been under ruins for two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the national paragliding team, coached for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paraglider pilots.
Other of those captives at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"Given my experience in paragliding work, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recounted how, hours after airing news of the Roa Roa hotel's collapse in the paragliding sport practitioners' community, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But there was only a gray tick next to his messages, and not two blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages have not been transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while powering an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was powering an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to carry more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "ran behind the Brink employee's back" and stole a bag of money that needs to be transported.
According to the release, witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information on their identity will be asked to contact the Newport police at telephone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye".
It made the Twitter change announcement on Saturday: "the individual officially known as Kanye West".
41-year-old West is called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he expects to release his new album, Yandhi.
It comes on the show instead of singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled "for emotional reasons", the show's producer noted.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West previously stated that this word also has a religious significance to it.
"I think "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you", West also said earlier this year, in the discussion about the album's title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's about us.
It all began from "Kanye", which means the one, and it came to "Ye", this being a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and on the whole.
The album is more of a reflection on what we are as people."
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change his stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former West collaborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with hyphen, sometimes without, as well as with big letters.
Mexico's president promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military forces against civilians, with the country's proximity to the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when students' leftist movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and by opening several free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after several members of the U.S. government made announcements on AI, even though an official strategy for artificial intelligence is missing in the U.S...
China, meanwhile, presented its plan last year: it aims to come first in terms of innovation of the IA by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are much further back than the US and that we are looking for the next breakthrough on AI," Lee said.
Double the funds could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers IA: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that defeated American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later was executive director at Microsoft Research and chairman of the Google branch in China.
Lee appreciated previous American governments' competitions in technology, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge of Advanced Defence Research Projects, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government funds, Lee said.
"It's not China that puts sticks in the wheels of academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired outstanding graduates from universities to work at AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the US step up its IA efforts.
"I think that a visa should automatically be offered to PhD students in AI," he said.
China's State Council issued a New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to how the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier in the year, the United States Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, in order to involve partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
Also at this time, NSF invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there were no changes in United States legislation aimed at creating a Commission for National Security in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians to vote in referendum if they want country name change
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wanted the country's name changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", a change that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which comprises a province called Macedonia, claims that the neighbouring country's name is a claim to its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposing nationalists claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's mostly Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign planted doubt about turnout, possibly not reaching the 50 per cent minimum limit required to validate the referendum.
The question on the ballot at the referendum will be: "Do you agree with EU and NATO membership, accepting the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 1:00 p.m.
However, attendance was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of people with voting rights submitted to the vote.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje, the country's capital.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, as well as their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on changing Macedonia's name, which will allow him to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and pulled chairs in front of tents erected by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with our heads up, and not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the majority will be in favour of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after he cast his vote.
It said that a result in favour of changing the name would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, below the number of participants required.
According to another survey, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
For the referendum to be valid, turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since the government took over last May.
Video: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero manages to pass Brighton's entire defense and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass Brighton's defenses and achieve Manchester City 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
It seemed like Aguero was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among three defensive players from Brighton, before reaching the free side of the field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposing team players.
He managed to pass a defender, and then outscored several opposing players at the edge of the Brighton team's quad.
After that, he gave a pass to the left, with the balloon reaching Sterling.
The English striker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who kicked the ball with his right foot, managing to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the gate.
"Aguero faces a few leg problems," Pep Guardiola, Manchester City team manager, told reporters.
"I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that time".
But Sterling is the one who got them the initial advantage for the Azuri in the Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero achieved a deep pass in Brighton team territory at that stage.
Then he gave a pass on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane dribbled the balloon a few times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the gate.
The Azuri striker hit the balloon towards the net just before heading off the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage on the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to wreak havoc in the game against the Rockies.
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-offs, there were not many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win the game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still play-off implications for the Rockies, who hold an advantage with a Los Angeles Dodgers game in the NL West.
The Rockies have achieved at least one unpredictable spot, with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but are still trying to retain their first division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point that I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete under these circumstances?"
The national team has yet to announce the player who will open Sunday's match, but is reportedly inclined to let Scherzer strike his first strike in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening shot of match number 34, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 misses in 220 and 2/3 games this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding the making of a decision by the Supreme Court regarding Brett Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All our effort is at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big ones, I'm not running, but I'm actually running, that's why I'm trying so hard to support the good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this awful, radical group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using any means necessary, you can see the wickedness of them.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it away."
It also said that Democrats are on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see this in the last four days," he also said, describing the Democrats as "angry and mean, naughty and liars".
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was heavily booed by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
You leaked the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people with a different view.
People who express their views are no longer tolerated
It did not surprise me at all that Momentum activists in my local party supported the no-confidence motion as far as I am concerned.
After all, I am only one of the Labour Party members in Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehement in terms of anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the no-confidence motion was a criticism of me for not agreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar issues, ironically, on which Jeremy did not share views with previous leaders either.
The Labour Party's communication for Friday's meeting in Nottingham East mentioned that we "want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Much of the eight-year period as a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were so.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings are not held this way, and the promise of a "better, gentler" political environment has long been forgotten, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly apparent that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party's leadership.
Things have been like this since Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision of politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree on things that I would not have previously agreed with, including national security or the single market in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, a wave of abuses ensues on the desocialization networks calling for my removal from the party, denouncing center politics, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am luckier than my colleagues, because comments on my person tend to be political in nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination shown by my colleagues who are experiencing abuse of a sexual or racist nature, but maintain their level of involvement in this.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every motion to censor or change the selection rules, the party becomes less and less flexible on this issue.
Many people have recommended to me in the last two years to put my head down, not be so vocal, and everything "will be fine" like this.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence shown by the Thatcher government led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those most in need, as a local councillor or minister.
I have never hidden my political views, including in the last elections.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and the issues that I disagree with in relation to the current leadership are unclear to him.
To the people who supported Friday's motion, I can only tell them that, in the context that the country is heading towards Brexit, which will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to send is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for the citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of elimination from the party or of political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions I consider in your best interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team tops rankings
Despite two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's highly interactive match in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now top of the rankings, being the only team without any defeats of the ten.
In the end, it all came down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more advantage of their chances, which helped the host team and pleased coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to several tests during our matches to this point and continue to be unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The merits are awarded to the Ayr team, they took more chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute attempt, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a lead, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who could join the team, he playing at Warriors, allowed Melrose to change the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of an unaltered attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Ayr and, just halfway through the match, managed to score, and then managed to turn an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's touchdown, turned by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for several minutes due to serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken out of the field with the stretcher, and from the restart of the game, Ayr unleashed through the attempt of Stafford McDowall player, transformed by Climo.
Team Ayr captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the reserve player pay with an unturned attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a dire pressure.
However, the home team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for liking Climo without the ball, MacPherson was able to score, giving Ayr the advantage.
Climo transformed the attempt, as he did again close to starting the match again, after Kyle Rowe executed a "box kick" move and sent extreme Gregor Henry into depth for the host team's fifth try.
The star of the sitcom "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom "Still Game", seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he was appointed the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old man plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's beloved show, writing its script and playing alongside his longtime partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the number nine series, would be the last, and it appears that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to information in the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this news, although a source from Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wants to get involved in the "increasing restaurant industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia island hopes court will reopen path to Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
Public buildings fly the blue flag, like the ocean.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
We have to get her back."
Throughout Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of a lost rib to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict is still alive – just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at their highest level in decades, as Bolivia is awaiting an International Court of Justice ruling on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that The Hague tribunal will give a ruling in favour of Bolivia's claim and that after decades of firm talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate granting a sovereign outing to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia – facing a controversial fight for re-election next year – also has much to gain from Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it did.
The UN body within the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory belonging to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes just six months after the final pleas were heard, indicates that this case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, Chilean expert on international law.
And not only has Bolivia not been successful in the cause, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unusually quick.
Monday will bring for Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantages," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that, Morales – still one of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – was using the maritime issue as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen if it cannot trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons unless he can trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during a summit in Singapore, with the leaders of rivals.
Its comments come in the context that United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting diplomatic action on the nuclear threat more than three months after meeting North Korean President Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri said it was an "unreal dream" that continued sanctions and the objection of the United States regarding the declaration concerning the end of the Korean War would ever cause the territory in the north to give way.
Washington has reluctance to agree to the statement without Pyongyang taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and United States President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are a lot of skeptics who don't think that Pyongyang has serious intentions of giving up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris shows the latest trends regarding hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to expand your collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you no longer have to search.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants in Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
Not practical hats conquered the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion designers sent creations that steal eyes on the podium.
The piece of resistance of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant, beige-colored hat with a broad, feather-like boron, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included beaded melons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head against the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and did not fashion haute couture.
One of the creations appeared to be diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while another appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a fashion style, with oversized clothing, you are lucky.
Stylists expect enormous bonnets to return to luxury fashion stores.
Oversized hats return after the appearance of the "La Bomba" hat, the straw hat with a broad boron, seen to everyone, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the non-practical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely the beach straw bag, with a size as large as the swimsuit model that wears it.
The orange raffie bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of Jacquemus' spring-summer collection 2019 "La Riviera" at Paris Fashion Week
The star stylist, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL, "I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores the following summer, because the fashion designer had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record on academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high school and higher education, chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable topic of choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools demonstrated that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish got such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, languages, as matter, are held the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and other fields.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that for the reasons employers gave for the struggle to fill vacancies, 17% were attributed to a language skills shortage.
Therefore, increasingly, language skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future career.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov on over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit, 15% percentage.
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will be more likely to find significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn the languages that are considered to be most important to the United Kingdom when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with teachers who specialize in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may be.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so that it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would be playing in the opening of Sunday's preseason against the Denver Nuggets, in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play remains yet to settle.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers program of six preseason games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump's election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies this evening, in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five scheduled rallies the following week, which include stops at places where the electorate is favorable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his elected candidate for the Supreme Court seat is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to strengthen support for the upcoming midterm election, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's West Virginia election rally be held tonight and where can I track it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's election rally online in West Virginia via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump will likely discuss this week's hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, which has become strained over allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week, for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who are facing tough elections in November, gain a bit of ground.
Thus, those in President Trump's campaign said the role of these five rallies next week is "energizing volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control over Congress is so important for his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very busy campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Scheduled to take place in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won the election at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump tries to help Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, who is led in the polls.
"The fact that the president has come to try to propel him into the polls is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows determination and continues to fight to maintain chance for singles challenges that begin Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursome challenge may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players actually believe in it, especially in the case of competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
"They were leading us by six points, now the difference is just four points, so we're counting on this drop for a bit of motivation," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still twelve points at stake.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons to encourage, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have each won three out of four points.
Spieth sent the balls to the green zone with lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those holiday guttural howls became louder as the round advanced, especially when he scored a crucial point by which he tied the score back in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The shot by which he won the game at 15 was celebrated with a similar howl, a howl that makes you think the American team still has chances.
"You just have to focus and just worry about your own game," says Spieth.
That's all these players have left.
18 holes to make a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange yet adorable couple won four out of four matches and they can't seem to fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair who did not need any extra kicks on Saturday afternoon, but this claim is also valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, even for the nine Friday morning points.
This performance and the way in which their energy seems to flow towards and from the enthusiastic audience strengthens the opinion that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they were to complete a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature for now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs event, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
An additional shot and two doubles to the first nine holes plunged the Spaniard and the Swede into a pit so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
Sunday, though, no one will be safe.
Fourballs and foursome samples are fascinating and are worth watching up close due to the interactions between pairs, given and undated advice and how a strategy can change on the spot.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on Ryder Cup final day
Europe begins its last Ryder Cup day with a significant lead after ending Saturday's fourballs and foursome games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired pair composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two wins over a hesitant Tiger Woods, which increased their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to regain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes in the morning fourballs event and won the series by a score of 3 to 1.
The US opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome challenge, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points out of their 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to earn four points in a row, and along with Molinari, a pair nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to earn four points from the four opening games in all Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly supported each other to defeat the discouraged Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer, 5-4 score.
Woods, who had problems in his two games on Saturday, had occasional sparks of genius, but so far lost 19 of his 29 games at fourballs and foursome, seven of which were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome event and defeated 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe did not, however, have an obstacle-free journey on this pleasant and cool day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the standard for Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win 2-1 a contested match against Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs, then returned later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 to 3 in the foursome event, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team been able to recover a four-point deficit in singles challenges, though, because they are current trophy holders, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being second two days in a row, a counterattack on Sunday seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is "no chance" to disarm unilaterally as long as there is no trust
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday to the United Nations that the extension of sanctions would deepen mistrust in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the global council's annual General Assembly that "significant measures were implemented in North Korea to prove their good faith" last year, such as stopping nuclear tests and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear testing location and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"If we cannot trust the US, we will not trust our national security capabilities and, under such circumstances, we cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
Although Ri resumed North Korea's familiar objections about Washington's opposing resistance to a "scheduled" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant for not directly rejecting unilateral denuclearization, as the Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-time summit between a U.S. President in office and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to making progress towards a "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided guarantees on North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States stated that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not complied with demands to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on the 'first denuclearization' option and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, and even objects against the 'war-ending declaration'," Ri said.
"The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion that only people who do not know us have.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump to which the US leader at the United Nations referred earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these conditions, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year's speech, when he stated to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target U.S. territory with missiles from North Korea after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but made it clear that work was just beginning and that sanctions would remain valid until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this and added, "It doesn't matter if it takes two or three years or five months."
China and Russia say that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday the following for the UN Security Council: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we get complete, final and confirmed denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the halls of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not show very good results.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but just hours later, North Korea denounced the fact that he made "gangist threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a rocket launch ramp and nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
It said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted a normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing "macho" culture that causes them to undergo "all night" learning sessions, energized with much caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that students of the world's most prestigious university often do not even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference about the impact of lack of sleep on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came and said to me, «Why am I being told this only now, in the last year?»
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and chief executive of the university's health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course may involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within a section the image of a dorm room is presented, and students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, pants and books to be told what the effects of caffeine and light are and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
"We know that we cannot change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as everyone has a right to know what the health effects of smoking are," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that makes students proud to have learned all night still exists, he also says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain believe that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course, after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
It said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before enrolling at this institution where the competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students schedule an alarm to know when it is time to go to sleep, as well as for waking time, and know what the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard's team
Rangers suffer from another case of away depression because Dolly Menga's shot condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first away win since the 4-1 triumph over St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second 18-game defeat as a coach, which puts Rangers eight points behind Hearts, the authoritative leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and uninspired Rangers players never seemed able to tie.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth position in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third place, behind Hibernian, to a single goal difference.
And Rangers could also face other problems, as the Calum Spence outing referee had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown from the visiting team fans' lawn.
Gerrard switched eight players from the squad that won easily against Ayr to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get a tie with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained squad choked his opponents throughout the match.
Even though the Rangers had superior possession, Livingston used the balls they had more efficiently.
He should have scored just two minutes after the game began, when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman to the gate defended by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her past the bar.
The Rangers took control, however, left the impression that more they hope than they trust their game in the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed that he should have received a penalty when he clashed with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers managed only two shots per goal in the first half, however former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not at all disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although the goal in Livingstone's 34th minute did not respect the trend of the game, no one can deny it was worth it, even only for the effort made.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep run by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and passed it to Menga, the one who completed with a simple shot.
Gerrard acted at half time, when he switched Ryan Kent for Coulibaly; this move almost paid off immediately, when the extreme centered Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the butts to block him.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the same type of match they prefer, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting run after run.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' shot, then Lithgow sent his head past the corner kick.
Glenn Middleton, a reserve at Rangers, called for a penalty towards the end of the match, when he hit Jacobs however, again, Thomson disagreed.
Almanac: inventor of Geiger meter
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and counting CONTINUES...), is the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A device essential to science since then, the Geiger counter has also become essential to pop culture, as happened in the film "The Bells of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as cowboys with improbable propensities to science:
Man: "What is this?"
Rogers: “It is a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yeah, there's a lot of snaps!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise harmful cells
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can "detect" a protein common to many cancers and are then re-injected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "detect" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, then reinjecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancers", including those of breast, ovary, lung and colorectals, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, to take immune cells from patients and to "teach" them to target cancer cells, also worked to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a supporting diatribe of Trump, while wearing a MAGA cap, after appearing at the SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a wild show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he intended to run in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great cap, the artist unleashed himself in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist’
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a play starring Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, filming of West's diatribe was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with this posting.
Additionally, West complained to the public that he had trouble backstage due to his cap.
"They tried to intimidate me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I've been assaulted!
They also told me that I had come very low," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how low I've come?", then said that "I'm going to catch my Superman cloak, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try with love."
His comments attracted booing from the audience at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; one person on this team told the publication, "A full silence lay in the studio."
West was invited as a cutting-edge replacement for lead singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by TPUSA Conservative group leader Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the bravest spirits among us: THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING THE GLOAT."
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, tweeted that West, simply, "was himself and that's wonderful".
"But I choose not to reward anyone (buying him music or clothing or supporting his «art») whom I think he embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in his footsteps Diddy, formerly also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to "the artist formerly known as Prince".
Charge of attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington, star of the Game of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval violent fantasy series Warfare of Thrones, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing these roles on screen makes the boys think they need to be tough to be respected.
In an interview for The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought something had "happened wrong" and wondered how the issue of toxic masculinity could be handled in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow of the Warship of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he was "very determined" to talk about the issue.
"Personally, I am very determined to talk about it now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?" he asked himself.
"What have we taught men about being adults, given the problem we're facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What do young boys on TV and on the street learn, what makes them think it has to be a certain type of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because it is clear that something has happened wrong with young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he would not play in any way a series based on the Game of Thrones after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that he "has finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a new production of True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him due to the series The Game of Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife when I did this series, so it ensured my family's future and my life from now on," Kit said.
Rose starred as Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character Kit played in the multi-Emmy Awards winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly to some areas of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual HIV transmission is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered very widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of disease transmission come from inappropriate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of the effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked the data to Republican Party senators, talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters denounced Saturday allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the allegations were made by analysts and websites of "extremely right".
"Lies, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a Twitter post.
Disclosure information included Senators' personal addresses and phone numbers. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Supreme Court judge.
The leak occurred shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and presented the information to a member of Waters' team, Hill reported.
"These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The team member, whose identity, personal information and safety were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unfounded accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests that he does not have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be defiant.
You don't have to question the accuser's motivation.
You need to be calm and quiet."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the midterm election, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"Important, if true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had alerted "appropriate legal authorities and entities to these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will answer to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members."
Review Johnny English strikes again: the weak parody of spy films, starring Rowan Atkinson
It has become a tradition to seek meanings associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the action film parodies series that has Johnny English as the main character, the series that started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returns.
Will this taunting satire of how strange we are become the nation's new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with the eyes staring and the rubber face, has been renewed for the second time his license to ruin everything. The character's name means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the film audience in non-English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the twisted secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that guy who contributed a single note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
The character is based on the explorer and mysterious countryless man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard commercials for TV, who left chaos behind him.
This last JE adventure also has one or two cute moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor blades slightly hit his helmet.
The gift Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is quite weak and, strangely, superfluous, especially because "serious" films, such as those in 007 series or Mission impossible, confidently offer comic moments as an ingredient.
Humour seems to address children more than adults and, to me, Johnny English's wacky adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's silent film gags when playing Bean.
As usual, the premise always is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated Britain's supersecret web network of spies and revealed the identities of undercover English agents, much to the desperation of the service agent, a regrettablely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a pompous and under siege prime minister, who is already suffering a serious crisis due to the drop in political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with her character like Theresa May, but the script does not give her a chance to shine.
His secret intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so they must activate a retired agent.
This is Johnny English's own fool, now working as a teacher in a school for the upper class, who also gives lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute gags, because English runs a School of Rock-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency meeting, then is reunited with his old-time partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a little wasted.
So these Batman and Robin of creating entanglements in Her Majesty's Secret Service return to action, facing the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire of the technology industry who claims to be able to solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of burlesque adventures: disguised as waiters, set a fashionable French restaurant on fire, create chaos when they sneak aboard Volta's luxury vessel, then English triggers anarchy in pure form when they try to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to familiarize themselves with Volta's interior home.
This last sequence is very ambitious, however, as cute and colorful as the film is, it looks like a children's television production.
A rather mediocre film.
As with the other Johnny English movies, I can't stop asking myself: can the British film industry really not give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
Labour denies planning for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
The party apparently wants the heads of companies to take advantage of possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) giving employees another day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not be altered.
Sources say the idea would "fit" the party's economic program, which wants to tilt the balance in favor of the workers.
The move to the four-day working week is supported by the Trade Union Congress as a way in which workers can take advantage of the change in the economy.
A source from Labour Party leadership told The Sunday Times, "The announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won't happen over night, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspiration in the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party's overall strategy on industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party."
The shadow cabinet's Lord Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell stated that he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profitmakers" from utility companies.
The plans of the lord chancellor of the shadow cabinet also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of water-supplying kings may not recover their actions in full, because the Labour government could levy "deductions" due to established crimes.
It also confirmed plans to appoint workers to the boards of companies and create property funds by which to cede 10% of the private sector companies' equity to employees, who will thus receive annual dividends of up to about £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on the show "60 Minutes" whether investigating Kavanaugh by the FBI would change their minds
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed the final vote on his candidacy as a Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators might be persuaded to stop supporting him due to FBI findings.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
"I have said this since the hearings began; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up and I asked him, «Are you guilty?»
The answer was decided, promptly, unequivocally."
Graham's vote, however, appears to be dug into the stone.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so it would take some explosive charges," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett firmly dismisses the charges," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the persons she appointed confirmed the account.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt it will change anything."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive group of stars, with an equally impressive mission: eliminating world poverty.
Upon reaching its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will attract tens of thousands of people to the Central Park lawn, not only to pursue artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help raise awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But how successful was the Global Citizen Festival when it is only 12 years away to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism", a concept that refers to people who feel they have accomplished something by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011 there have been more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
The organisation says that these actions have spurred world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its shares, in whose account at least $10 billion had already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and intermediaries who have committed to "helping children grow to their full potential", which promised to offer Rwanda $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4700 Twitter messages from global citizens.
"With the help of the government of Britain, donors, national governments and global citizens just like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition only become a footnote in the book of history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, in front of the crowd during a live concert in London, in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were carried out in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund the project The Power of Nutrition, which would provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But, like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists to perform at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces for a "blockade" that would hamper Russia's energy exports, says Home Secretary
Washington can, "if necessary", appeal to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, in particular, where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to broker the sale of energy, as they do in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and ways to manage the situation.
"The United States has the ability, through our naval forces, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, create a blockade, so that energy does not come into the market," he said.
Zinke addressed attendees to an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
It continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is basically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying of Russia that he "knows one trick" because of the economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In doing so, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economical project.
The Kremlin said that the US' fierce opposition to the project is propelled by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we look at it the same way: energy cannot be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Minister of Energy in Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Secretary of Energy in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's main industrial organisation, the Federation of Industries of Germany (BDI), urged the US not to interfere in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third state intervening in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "seriously thinks" of running in the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Senator, said on Saturday that she had to "think seriously" whether to run in the presidential election after the midterm election.
During the meeting at the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
"It is time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for that it takes a strong woman," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider whether to run in the presidential election."
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying that he "directed the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet message on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that even the majority of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probably" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy of it and 48% are against it.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the Senator of Vermont.
Biden said it would officially be decided by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome that Track Palin suffers from at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case
"The things my own son is going through, which he went through after he has returned...I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the aftermath of the injuries our soldiers are returning with," he told the audience gathered at a rally supporting Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "return a little different, tougher, come back wondering if there is any respect for what they and their soldiers in the armed and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of an act of domestic violence and possession of a drunken firearm, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and District of Colombia challenge new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses granting asylum to victims who try to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae request in Washington on Friday to support a challenge to asylum seekers policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions trial which the American Civil Liberties Union organization initiated in August against federal policy was not revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gang", abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
State-appointed lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produced a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled a 2014 Immigration Appeals Council decision that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal law says that all asylum applications must be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such a limitation violates this principle," writes the amicus curiae application.
In addition, lawyers argue in the demand that policy that refuses immigrants entry affects the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. Attorney General, ordered in June judges for immigration cases to stop granting asylum to victims who are trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
"Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or because of a political opinion," Sessions said on June 11, when he announced politics.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the death toll doubled, in a race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who comforts her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation center in the destroyed town of Palu.
"Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
Residents began returning to their destroyed homes and organizing their flooded goods, trying to save everything that can be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcome by the situation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his spine and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are being treated outdoors due to strong and continuous aftershocks.
It has tearful eyes when it remembers how the violent earthquake felt shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor it shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry out for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "abuse" of "propaganda ads"
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in a US daily in which it praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the U.S. Ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using U.S. media to distribute propaganda material.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to China's paid supplement in Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 election for Congress, an accusation China rejects.
The charge that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters that it was a new phase in a campaign in Washington's escalation to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in a growing trade war, involving waves of tariff increases for imports.
The tariffs imposed by China as revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported Trump's Republican Party, experts from China and the US said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor to Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published in Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad wrote that China "continues this abuse by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press".
"When disseminating propaganda by publishing an advertisement in Des Moines Register, the government of China does not respect the so prized tradition in America of freedom of speech and a free press," writes Branstad.
"Instead, at the street kiosk here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent views Chinese citizens have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish" his article, though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans alienate female voters before midterm elections over Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, from several sexual abuse charges, analysts warned that there would be a counter-action, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm election.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and most Republicans who publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona's representative) last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation would calm the angry electorate.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, won't forget tomorrow and won't forget in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive group said Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November's coming!" as they demonstrated in the Senate hallways when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But they could be even bigger, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that it might follow a counter-action if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
"This has turned into a mix-up for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote on the committee or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but also about how Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an election support group for Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe strongly or believe Ford's testimony is likely to have been true, while 35% said they strongly believe it or that Kavanaugh's testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford declared under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had abused her, drunk, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals to her while attending a party while they were students at Yale, in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a Solid-based company, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is entitled to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he talked about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data archives" or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this "personal consolidation through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely messed up at once.
"We're not asking their permission."
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "The Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when it created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The cleric who won the Victoria Cross in World War I is celebrated
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victoria Cross medal as a combatant in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded Britain's highest military honor.
A commemorative stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderfully symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after the deed by which his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very dense fog and under intense artillery and machine gun fire".
Later, he rushed to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", paved the way for the soldiers, then attacked an artillery nest alone and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "one thing I know I will never be able to equal, but that makes me feel humble".
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a crown after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said that he "feel very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a genuine hero is demonstrated by the support a lot of people give him".
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig cartoons instead
Imagine that you stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars, just so you could not watch the main event.
The San Jose event schedule contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and had to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, UK spectators were amazed when the broadcast was replaced by an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not satisfied at all, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
One fan Twittered the switch to children's cartoon as "some sort of bad joke".
"Government regulations say that this content is not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, they would schedule their events in such a way that they could also be watched by spectators in Britain.
"When I think about reruns, I think we could probably work it out," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, we thought it was a technical mix-up.
But it wasn't that, it was government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We’ll stick to five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to give fans more and we crossed the line.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to all because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he got to school that "not everyone is like me".
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay people's rights to give others "hope".
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual presenter of the tradition show, will be missing for a few months due to an illness.
Invited in the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "inferior" to others because "it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls."
He said: "To date, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different, were the real things that gave me strength and endurance to achieve success."
He wanted to prove he was "someone," he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they would eventually learn about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics became a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and took advantage of appearing at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live freely, without consequences, and because he wants to give others "hope".
The triple world champion said he "was taken by surprise" by falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married the Academy Award-winning filmmaker last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14, and his father died of cancer after three years - he said, it's hard to find someone the same age who went through the same good and bad times.
The two became, in June, the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed his "whole perspective".
"If I had been asked last year, I would have been interested in nothing but winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if they had received tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, because he wanted to be in the first place.
"I couldn't tell him «you won't be able to be in the first place, Father»," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life, to jump in front of the spectators of my country at the Olympics, there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in the chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still thrills him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, was benched Saturday in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday, when he will play in his forty-seventh Ryder Cup match, but he will have to recover from a good form in order not to be an unhappy occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursome challenges.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the United States team, the major tournament-winning quintuple split her day between cheerleading for teammates and practicing her kicks, with the hope that she would right what she had wronged.
The 48-year-old player has never had the straightest drives, not even during the best period of his career, so he is not the best choice for the narrow ground at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish incorrect kicks.
And if the field isn't a big enough challenge, in the ninth game of Sunday Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion, who allied himself with novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points at the entrance to the 12 singles matches, which must start in force at this stage.
Furyk stated confidence in his player's ability, but could not have said otherwise anyway.
"He completely understood the role he played today, patted me on the shoulder, hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of faith in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed greatly to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but that's what happened and that's how I thought we had to do it.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most matches played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which no longer amounted to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 games won, 20 lost and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's smart, he likes to joke with players, he's a great guy in the team locker room," he explained.
"I think young players have fun joking with him, it was fun to watch them do it during the week.
His role is more important, it's not just about the game."
Europe's team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the considerable advance may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of singles trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game in Valderrama, when the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but barely managed to defeat them by a minimum difference, of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"I remember we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we also had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win," said Bjorn (in the picture) after watching the 2018 team, which won 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, and now leads 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"So history shows me and my team that it is not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let's go out in the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are placed on the board.
We have a goal and that is to win this trophy, that must remain the goal.
We always said, we have to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also know what lies ahead on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted by the way his players handled themselves on difficult ground, Bjorn added: "I am in no hurry to draw conclusions.
Tomorrow's a whole different situation.
Individual performance is important tomorrow, and this is different.
It's great to be on the field with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the fullest, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to send to the players, that they must be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they leave their partner behind and have to play as best they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play better in the singles event than they did with partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such comebacks on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then in the losing one when Europe succeeded in "the miracle of Medina".
"I remember every word," he responded when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.
We created the right batch and ordered the players as we would like, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned the task of leading the fight: he would face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I chose this group of players, in this order, because I think they cover all topics," Bjorn said of the squad for the singles challenge.
Germany's new warship postponed again
Germany's newest naval force frigate should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace obsolete Cold War warships, but this will not happen until next year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The entry into service of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the banner ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, was now delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems after delivery affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships the Navy commanded in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to be fitted with a strong cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas missiles, as well as stealth technologies, which provide a low radar, infrared and acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to be able to go on two-year missions without returning to the original port.
However, continued delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to increase Germany's maritime force, will already be obsolete before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was discussed in the press last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was proven that the vessel was many too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future endowments.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as vessels used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including that of crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached an astounding 3.1 billion euros (US$3.6 billion), from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power is waning.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in Germany's parliament, admitted that the Navy "began to run out of ships that can be sent on missions".
The official said the problem grew steadily over time, as the old vessels were out of service without being replaced by new ones.
It deplored the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates came into operation within the Navy.
National Trust Spys on the Secret Life of Bats
New research that is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how bats use their environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these novel flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will analyze common dwarf bats and pygmies bats, as well as ear bats and water bats from Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located in key places around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and which species emit certain sounds.
A map of the habitat and a report will also be produced to create a detailed, scale-based picture of their behaviour in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a consultant on nature conservation for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as lawn creation, and which is the best way to maintain forest meadows for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout Britain have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development work affecting their nests, but also habitat loss.
Wind turbines and public lighting are also risks, as are fly traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, bats aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, thinks very seriously of bats.
They have ten trained experts, who periodically conduct studies, control nests and sometimes conduct rescue missions.
The organization even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, on the Threate estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of ten species of bats are found in Scotland.
The manager of the estate, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here, at Threave, the area is wonderful for bats," he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there's a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand what they need to multiply."
It emphasizes the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance work at properties, as mere unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy all the local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are forbidden actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official within the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
This said, "We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don't know how populations evolve for many of our species."
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said that the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "want to advertise" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal's striker and Juventus team were accused of raping a woman in America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the Golden Balloon winner quintuple in front of the video camera.
"They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I am a happy man and everything is fine," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers prepare to sue Der Spiegel over these charges, which they called "an inadmissible report of privacy-related suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for "moral damages equivalent to an adequate amount for the seriousness of the deed, which is probably one of the worst personal rights violations in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he anally raped her, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court, in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that, after the incident, Ronaldo fell to her knees and told her that he was "a good boy" in the proportion of "99 %", and that he was betrayed by that "a percentage".
The document claims Ronaldo confirmed that she had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims to have addressed the police and that the photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, however she later accepted a deal outside the courtroom because she was "terrified by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that she would "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that deal because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack he was accused of, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK "would forever regret" loss of automakers
Britain "would regret forever" if it lost world leader status in motor vehicle production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
It added that it is "worrisome" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain exits the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the case of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory at Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis brands of Toyota are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain exits the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they were afraid of exiting the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of the "fixed on time" principle: for custom-made cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from suppliers in the UK and in the EU.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems could arise at the border, which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a shortage of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of the inventory for one day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "calibrated precisely to avoid these delays at the border".
"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said for the BBC Radio 4 show Today.
"Evidence from not only Toyota, but also other producers, shows that we need to be able to continue using what was a set of supply chains with great success."
Toyota could not state how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that increased prices could reduce the long-term competitive capacity of the plant and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the United Union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: "Experience has taught me that, after they disappear, these jobs never return."
A government spokesman said, "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "further postponed" as he was fighting for Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in the election, the links between Trump's aids and Russia and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumor has it that Trump may fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president via Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports claim he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the United Nations New York headquarters, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate legal committee hearing, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, which again postponed the vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date has not been set yet. It can be this week or it can be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would dispute this statement: Sanders has not had a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by the dislike of TV reporters, who like to show off, although he added, "I don't deny that they like to show off."
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The President attends more questions and answers sessions than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analyzed the figures."
"There will still be briefings," said Sanders, but "it seems to me much better that the press have the opportunity to directly address the questions to the President of the United States, not to me.
We try to do this most of the time and you could notice that we have done this many times in recent weeks, and discussions with the President of the United States will replace press briefings when it is available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences awarded exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this was happening, making an impromptu appearance, at times bizarre, in front of gathered reporters.
A Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health is addressed in a letter to EU employees at the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland about Brexit concerns
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter as there are less than six months until the UK is withdrawn from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to bear the costs of receiving permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, expecting decision-making this autumn.
But the UK Government has also begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario where there would be no agreement to exit the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Fellows in the European Union, but also from outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head on Saturday, in the match his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores, a score of 31-27, Mike Organ of Tennessee said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the shot occurred shortly before halftime.
"It reached the edge line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie was put on the oxygen mask by the physical preparers and medical staff, on the sideline, before placing him on a stretcher and transporting him off the ground for a thorough evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operation he was undergoing at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scale of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five tackles in total before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 tackles throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp court fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, with additional money to be used to help homeless people, according to the Conservative Party's new plans
This change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with voting rights
The stamp fee will be applied to non-tax payers in the United Kingdom
Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year for homelessness relief
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp court fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May is expected to announce today.
The change will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with voting rights, promising more advantageous homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher stamp court fee will be applied to individuals and legal entities who are not taxpayers in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help homeless people.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stamp court fee, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for rental purposes, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring up to £120 million a year.
About 13% of the newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the United Kingdom, leading to higher prices and making it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp court fee cut to help young people buy their first home.
It accused large construction firms of maintaining high prices on property as a result of land purchase without using it, however, and asked Theresa May to waive taxes on affordable homes, with a view to resolving the UK "house issue".
Corbyn announced a number of proposals for attractive real estate reforms, including rent controls and an end to unmotivated evacuations.
It also wants to give the councils greater powers in terms of building new houses.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime minister's mandate to fulfilling the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means remedying the problems that exist in the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with headquarters abroad, be able to buy houses as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a house has become one far too distant, and living under unworthy conditions is far too real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland's national team"
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that his "final goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of the Scotland national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of "resurrecting" the northeastern club, which is currently in 3rd place in the First League, with a three-point difference from first place.
He moved this summer to the team at Light Stadium after he managed, last season, to return the St. Mirren football team to the Scottish Premiership first division.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We made it to the national's B team and that's about it," Ross told Sportsound to BBC Scotland.
"But I spent much of my childhood watching Scotland's games at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I am successful as club manager."
Ross' predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland Club, include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former club manager Alloa Athletic said he was not nervous about being the successor to such established names and to such an important club, having turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that concerns me that could affect my success is the question "Can I help this team return to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities existing in this club allow him to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get her to go there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is contributing to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years experience in management, after a period of being assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a training staff member at Hearts.
He then helped the Alloa club recover after relegating to the C division and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship title the following season.
Ross said he was feeling better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over management of the Alloa club.
“I really thought the role of manager rather than the role of player suits me.
It may sound strange, because we had a good time, we were making a good win and we had a few good moments.
But it's hard being a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them every week.
I face similar situations as a manager, in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel it is the right role for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now, that I can do that, I feel it's the thing that suits me best in my entire adult life."

The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is at 5.30 on Saturday, according to a survey
This summer's heat surge led to an increase in revenue in pubs in the UK, however, putting more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the CGA company representative who provides business consulting services and who conducted the survey, said: "The constant heat and England's World Cup participation over a longer period than expected contributed to a pattern in July, similar to the one in the previous month, when pubs recorded up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of customers lower by 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June fell further in July.
Pubs and bars serving only drinks made a much higher profit than restaurants.
Food pubs have also experienced heat losses, but not as big as restaurants.
Looks like people went out just to drink.
Booze sales at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food recorded a 3% drop."
Paul Newman, the RSM company representative who provides services in the hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large sports and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the advertising market OOH.
No wonder restaurants continue to suffer losses, although the fall in sales by 4.8% year-on-year will add to current cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the moderater temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the small number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over £9 billion, which is the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network that they hide from their parents
According to one survey, one in five children, some up to the age of 11, have a secret social network account that they hide from parents and teachers
A survey conducted at the level of 20,000 middle school students revealed an increase in accounts "falsely by Insta"
The news has raised concerns about sexually contented postings
20% of students said they have a "principal" account that they show their parents
One in five children, some even up to the age of 11, create an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in "falsely by Insta" accounts, referring to the Instagram photo-sharing platform.
The news has increased concerns about sexually contented postings.
20% of the students said they hold a "principal" and "clean" account that they show their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother, who mistakenly discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, observed the posting of a teenager demanding to be "raped".
According to research, carried out by the UK-based Digital Awareness company and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) association in independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them have admitted to holding secret accounts.
HMC association director Mike Buchanan said, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don't have access to."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletic Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected for the position of director, without executive power, of the Scottish Athlete Commission, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, the president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions in terms of sports activity to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys respect throughout the community of athletes in Scotland, Great Britain, as well as around the world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits with its inclusion in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle also said, "I'm delighted that I will be able to represent athletes and hope to make a real contribution and help the way sporting activities are carried out in Scotland."
The American national athlete, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC, remained invalid after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would decide whether I would recover or to what extent.
It was titanic work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A breast pump ad that compares women to cows divides public opinion online
A breast pump company has caused the division of public opinion into the online environment with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers to cow milking.
To mark the launch of a pump that is intended to be "the world's first silent and portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released an ironic commercial, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom the new pump offers to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay for cows on a melody that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "in case you haven't noticed, these are not udders, but my breasts."
The chorus continues: "I pump, pump, breastfeed the baby, pump, pump, extract the milk from the girls."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was the target of mixed reactions from those who viewed it, with many of them saying it brings out the "horrors" in the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen only a few days after birth," one person wrote.

Another person commented: "It is understandable how traumatic it is, for both the mother and the child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "An extremely inappropriate advertisement."
Other people defended the ad, with one person stating that he thought it was a "hilarious" advert.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping really made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant," one person wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a funny advertisement targeting mothers who use the pump (often at work or in toilets) and who feel like "cows".
It's not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they danced with the discreet pumps inserted into the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, giving women freedom of movement, the possibility of holding their children in their arms and even going out while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner, consultant and design developer at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved such a bold and challenging launch.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight what the use of a breast pump and the challenges involved, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will give.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump has made the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, the podium featured the mother of two children while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were secretly transferred to a refugee camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased, although the number of people crossing the border each month remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration caused the procedure of placing children at sponsors to be made more difficult.
Usually, many sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and fear they will endanger their stay in the country if they request to take over children.
Risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must record their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior customs and immigration authority (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) official, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Subsequently, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
"About 80% of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors live illegally in the country, and much of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," said Albence.
In order to speed up child processing, authorities have introduced new rules, according to which children must appear in court one month after detention, and not 60 days as stipulated by the previous standard, according to shelter employees.
Many will plead for the case via a video call, and not personally before an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the longer they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to shelter employees and reports issued by the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are emphasized at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility that signs indicating that a child has problems are not noticed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to refugee camp without giving them enough emotional training time or to say goodbye to friends could cause them trauma, which many of them are already suffering from.
Syria demands that US, French and Turkish military forces withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also acting Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces are on an illegal Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "the situation will be managed properly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any condition," he said within the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been uprooted from their own homes.
He also said Damascus would continue "this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
In Syria there are about 2,000 military troops in the United States, who are particularly in charge of training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also more than 1,000 French military troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Moualem said that there were favourable conditions for their return and accused "a few Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", which led refugees to keep distance.
It added, "We have called for the support of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return."
"Political influences are brought on an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a demilitarised area in the Idlib region to drive out the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped avoid a large-scale assault with the help of Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have links to the Al-Qaeda network and which "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations emissary, hopes to meet soon in a first sitting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for election.
Moualem presented the conditions for Syrian government participation in the committee, saying that the committee's activities must be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning about interference.
Why Trump will win his second term
If we were to follow that logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless the dismissal procedure or scandals ended his tenure as president earlier, which much of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case it would, without a doubt, be "the most dramatic finale of a term as president of all time!"
Up to this point, it appears that the audience is still interested in the subject.
As of 2014, prime-time audiences doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and nearly tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in prime-time, Fox News television is being watched, on average, by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was being watched by 1.7 million, and the "The Rachel Maddow Show" from MSNBC recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people watching it the evenings on which important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," Neal Baer, producer of ABC's drama series "Reserve President", said about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is harnessed.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the action in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can also be completed about the state of the global economy.
Changing the station is a luxury that only privileged audiences can afford.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you reach the sixth hour of viewing the debate by an expert committee of how Bob Woodward uses "deep background" (confidential) sources for his book, "Fear", about Paul Manafort's $15,000 worth ostrich leather jacket ("an opulent clothing item", according to The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy actress Daniels' shocking descriptions of Trump's "anatomical parts".
For example, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"A lot of what it does gives you the feeling that you watch a reality show and feeds you topics every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment media group and creator of "Aces of Pawn", about the constantly changed distribution and the daily twists of situations caused by Trump (the triggering of a quarrel with the American Professional Football League, the praises brought to Kim Jong-Un).
You can't afford to miss an episode, because you'll feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his house on the northern shore of Kauai Island, outside it was 27 degrees and it was sunny, and he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He could not get away from the television, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was to face the Senate's legal committee and would decide the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing some extraordinary shows in the past, and people said, «This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization»," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but apparently they were right."

Overwhelming external financial resources for the closest interim elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of electoral districts, from which resulted two term holders in an election race for the same position, it is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th electoral district enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburgh district brought Democratic representative Conor Lamb into the race, who won, in another district, the special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent termholder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th electoral district, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
Electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were not constitutional, with district boundaries handled in favor of Republicans.
The race in the 17th new electoral district triggered a competition in campaign funding between important party funding bodies, the Congress Committee for Campaign of Democrats (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a special, maximum-audience election that took place in March for Pennsylvania's 18th electoral district.
For over a decade the position had been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district by a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador because of its deal with China, but then dropped
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated the Trump Organization leadership team.
State Department officials decided to call the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
But they were taken into consideration as sanctions only against El Salvador State, which received US aid worth about $140 million in 2017, including narcotics control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country of Central America and the high rate of unemployment and crimes there.
As internal meetings made progress, officials in North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from being directed to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials at the head of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively finishing any examination of sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled in mid-October, wanting to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their accounts were corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close associate of the administration and who also spoke on condition that anonymity was preserved.
Study of History
The next thing that could happen is Special Adviser Robert Mueller's report on President Trump's possible obstruction of justice, about which there is now solid evidence made public.
Mueller also appears to be targeting his investigation into investigating the existence of a plot between Trump's campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face due responsibility within the body, just as he prepares to appear before voters and perhaps a jury made up of his peers.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that a "fall" of Trump is inevitable, which is also true of his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make and that will decide the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike a coup against Hitler, only if the West had opposed and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing a few such critical moments right now.
What are we going to do if Trump dismisses Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times newspaper account was incorrect.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the interim election for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
He survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team is optimistic about the match with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match with the Austrians, after Spain's impressive equal against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place her in a strong position to qualify from the European League's G-group.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season to equal 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers team can use this result to his advantage to achieve better performances.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
“We started the match thinking that we would get a good result and won a point.
We probably could have scored at the end, but overall, I think the equal was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we were better off in the second.
Thursday will once again be an important night for Europe.
With any luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, with supporters support, we will definitely feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my injuries and changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is fine and the boys really like to be here; the training is also going well.
Let us hope that we will persevere, that we will leave behind what happened in the last season and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia due to retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about this.
About half of the people who participated in the study conducted by Nationwide said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with the husband/wife.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about the subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't initiate this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your husband/wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide the care you need if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve the Financial Adviser: the Financial Adviser can also be of real help in terms of paying these expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can secure your own well-being – as far as you have the money.
Get your legal documents up to speed: come face to face with legal issues.
Get a power of attorney on decisions of a medical nature to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate them.
Also consider performing a power of attorney on your financial resources.
Choose a reliable person to make the financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your invoices are paid if you do not have the capacity to do so.
Don’t forget the little details: imagine that one of your older parents has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are who handle it?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Draft a plan on all these things."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a strong earthquake and a tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to authorities, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, an area in northern Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province in central Sulawesi Island, which is at the end of a narrow bay, on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of about 379.800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating 40 years of existence when it was struck by the tsunami and earthquake.
Donggala is a regency spanning a coast more than 300 km in northwestern Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region that lies below a province, has a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture activities are the central point of the province's economy in central Sulawesi Island, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
The mining activities for nickel extraction are also important in the province, but are concentrated mostly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi Island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the deaths of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the Donggala Regency, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is in the Pacific Fire Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: on December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, causing the deaths of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: a series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra Island in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit the south of the most populous Indonesian island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6 degree magnitude earthquake occurred near the town of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: a 7.5-magnitude earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 metres high, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: a low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing damage and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2004, which resulted in a large number of deaths.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: several strong earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the deaths of over 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained stranded under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested following allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for vice president, Sarah Palin, was arrested following allegations of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaskan state policemen.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance of his female tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in police custody, at the Mat-Su unit, pending trial, and is detained on the basis of a $500 bail-free pledge, according to KTUU.
It appeared in court on Saturday, where it declared itself "100% innocent" when asked for plea, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A felony charges, meaning he could be incarcerated for a period of up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offense, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been brought such charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged assault.
The case is being tried at the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, implicating himself in a complaint of a domestic violence offence and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend's statement, he punched him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffers from after being part of military forces in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the death toll is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred off the central province of Sulawesi, which is located in the northeastern Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social networks that present the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the bank.
Federal prosecutor's office wants capital punishment for suspected New York City terrorist attack
The New York federal prosecutor's office wants capital punishment for Sayfillo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City following which eight people were killed, a rare punishment that was no longer enforced in the state for a 1953 federal offense.
Apparently, 30-year-old Saipov used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle track on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on its trajectory in October.
To justify capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the intent opinion on the death penalty claim, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both counts may receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saipov of 22 counts which include eight counts of murder in support of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation", prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the deed as "hodious, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, sufferings and losses for the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to the opinion of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
He confessed to investigators that he was happy about what he did, according to the cops.
Saipov told authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after watching the ISIS group videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
Also, according to police, he asked to fly the ISIS flag into the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty on the 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the public defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to enforce capital punishment, instead of accepting a plea of guilty with life imprisonment without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders previously asked the prosecution not to enforce capital punishment.
A Member of Parliament who is a member of the Conservative Party claims that NIGEL FARAGE must take the lead in Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today that he would "mobilize the civilian army", during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians must "feel pressure" from the Eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of Theresa May's Parliament who suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a Conservative Party MP, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have come out" by now if Farage was Secretary within the Brexit campaign.
But the challenge May faces in terms of the highly divided camps has been emphasized by members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest, against leaving the European Union organised in the city.
The prime minister is trying very hard to ensure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, runs properly, facing attacks from those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to stay in it, as well as from the European Union.
The Allies stressed that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and would force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her offer and "chaos".
Bone said at the event of the pro-Brexit "Leave Means Leave" movement in Solihull that he wanted "the waiver of the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and given the responsibility associated with negotiations with Brussels.
"If things were run by him, we would not be in the European Union," he said.
Conservative Member of Parliament, representative of Wellingborough constituency, added: "I will support the Brexit, but we must drop the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone denied suggestions on changing public opinion at the 2016 vote: "It is not at all true that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative Party member who supports the Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters, "I just want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to people's voices.
"The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it, nor do our activists who take to the streets and who support us, first of all, in elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message targeting Theresa May, this added: "The prime ministers who retain their office are the ones who keep their promises."
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians must be put in a position to "feel pressure" if they are about to drop the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"It is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray the Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let them do so".
In a message to enthusiastic contentment, he added: "I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the civil army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governed and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support staying in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that said "The Conservative Party is against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at Conservative Party members and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the digitization of customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a hoax.
Brexit does not benefit," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator of Massachusetts spoke Saturday about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running to be re-elected in the November election against Geoff Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives from the Republican Party, who was co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She was at the heart of speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with citizens with voting rights using the city hall format since Trump took over as president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that the time had come for "women to arrive in Washington to resolve the problems of our badly affected government and this includes a woman at his head".
A suspect was arrested in the death case that caused the death of player Sims from the LSU team
Baton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the death case that caused the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They published a video of the time of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man in the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, that he was in possession of a gun, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into police custody, at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original squad in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after his team helps him win over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that orders given by the Mercedes team would play an essential role in the race.
Standing in first position in the standings, Bottas had a good start and nearly defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the stand and leave Hamilton in the queue of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped at the pit one lap later and came from behind Vettel, however Hamilton managed to move forward after a few schemes that forced Ferrari's driver to let the interior loose, after making a double move to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race on the rear row of the grid and was in seventh place near the end of the first lap, on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to outrun Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
Eventually, he stopped at the pit at lap number 44, but could not increase the pace in the final eight laps, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
“It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman, letting me go forward.
And the team did an excellent job to achieve victory over Ferrari and to achieve this double," said Hamilton.
A Terrible Body Language
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday, at a rally on her insistence that she did not facilitate the "flow" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address, directly, Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "bad, immoral and liars".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and liars," he said.
"When you see that they published and leaked information and then say that they did not.
They're not the ones responsible.
Do you remember?
When I asked Dianne Feinstein if she had facilitated the "flow" of the document?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..what?
Uh... no.
I didn't do this."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we do that?..No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and it was "troubled" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "drip" occurred from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations that concern Ford and I am not the one who facilitated the "flow" of her account," Feinstein told the commission, according to Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial does not seem to have suited the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the candidate's defense for the Supreme Court, which was charged with sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to take power in every way possible.
Notice the wickedness, immorality, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to destroy to get power and control," the president said, according to the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee's Stars win 5-3 over Belfast's Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars team paid for Friday's Elite League loss, winning over the Belfast Giants in the return game on Saturday, with a score of 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead, with the kicks being carried out by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back in front of the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard tied the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat this season for Adam Keefe's players, who had recovered ground by defeating the Dundee team 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's opening show kicked off in the fourth minute and 3:35 respectively, from a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford decisively pitched to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that started so dynamically, Sullivan brought the host team back into the game in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the opportunity to score for a tie in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' advantage before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first inning.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard tied again with an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later, in the second innings, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, thus securing the team's 5th place climb in the standings, midway through the last inning.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will, on Friday, host for Milton Keynes in their next match.
An air traffic controller died after securing the take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers during an earthquake
An Indonesia air traffic controller is considered a hero, dying after securing the safe take-off of an aircraft with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a strong earthquake rocked Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several strong replicas in the area and many people are stuck under the debris of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, refused to leave his post in the Mutiara Airport control tower Sis Al Jufri in Palu, which was shaking heavily.
It remained on the ground to ensure that Batik Air's 6321 flight, which was on the runway at that time, would take off safely.
He then jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed he was about to collapse.
He died later at the hospital.
The spokesman for Indonesia's air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I have prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are saddened by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency saying access is limited to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe the number will increase, as many victims are still under the ruins and we have not had access to many of them," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to six metres high devastated the town of Palu, with a joint funeral to be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute, an ambulance brings casualties.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the minimarkets are being robbed."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN, "The Red Cross in Indonesia is in a hurry to provide help to survivors, but we do not know what they will find at the scene.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army, "Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" CNN announced.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which resulted in more than 550 deaths.
Aviation crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia has now stated that one person is missing, having previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger has been missing since the afternoon of Saturday.
She also noted that she is trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details of the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and United States Naval Forces said the plane missed the airstrip and ended up in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe the plane topped the end of the runway.
U.S. nationality passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane reached a very short distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers were able to cross the water, which had reached up to the waist, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and were screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The United States Naval Forces said that sailors working nearby to renovate a wharf jumped to aid, used an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank 30 feet underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents by some airlines registered in the PNG in the past two decades, but none of these included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded its plea regarding the resumption of trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the United States Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the cell phone records to piece together the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, as well as those of his victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that she received localization data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, this being at odds with his earlier claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
At the time the data revealed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called to the witness stand and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he stated that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he "lied, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted the text messages, calls and contact details of Chambers from his phone.
"He deleted it from his life," Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defence will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: what is conscious hip-hop?
A trio who plays hip-hop music wants to change the negative way in which this kind of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
The band The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has stopped sending political messages and addressing social issues, as it was initially doing.
They want to return to their origins and make hip-hop aware to be popular again.
A recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the United Kingdom has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her after she received a "racist" text message
A New York nanny sues a couple for dismissal on discriminatory grounds after accidentally receiving a text message from the mother, in which she complained that this was "another black person".
The couple denied being racists, stating that she sued them for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed displeasure when she learned that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she presented herself on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOUUUUU! ANOTHER PERSON OF COLOUR", he wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the blunder, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, stating that the nanny, who is African-American, had not properly performed her duties and had expected to receive a Filipino nationality nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her work day and sent home with Uber.
Now she sues the couple to be awarded compensation for dismissal and claims the sum of $350 a day for six months, the period during which she was supposed to live with them and operate, despite the fact that this was done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that no such things are being done," she told the Post newspaper on Friday, adding "I know it's about discrimination".
The couple deny claims that they are racists, saying it was normal to fire Maurice, as they feared they could no longer trust her after offending her.
"My wife sent him the wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco, her husband, told the Post newspaper.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have wronged, even if by mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Viewing the process as an action of "extortion", Plasco said his wife would give birth in two months and that he was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to get back at a person under such circumstances?
That's not what's being done," the bank investor added.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's story editors feared readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following things about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time, before it gets published.
It's very funny now, after seeing that Paddington had a huge success."
She also stated that his father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "sweet-bitter" one after he died last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father had a discreet pride on the success she later enjoyed.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to brag," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was as if he had a child who had a success: you are proud of him, though it is not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad frequently called to tell me that it was very serious and that he didn't think he would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she was gonna die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medicines administered by doctors for her heart to continue pumping blood began to diminish and exit her body.
He had died a short time ago and the organs were starting to stop working.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was going on.
I could not scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, being in mourning after his daughter's death, boarded the plane, alongside other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears didn’t stop flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had an overwhelming sense of sympathy with Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two bereaved women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones because they have committed suicide are trying to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and including phone numbers to which people can call to receive support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't wish any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was to be a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone appreciated his smile.
They always said his smile changed your mood."
However, he quit work before he died, as he had arrived at a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Davis stated, "I keep thinking it's going to have a domino effect."
This created the messages “to tell people that they can call on someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Exteriorize, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' multi-year friend, lost Mark, the life partner he had had for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't tell me he wasn't feeling well or that he was depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he changed his attitude.
He was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children opened their presents and didn't even look them in the eye."
She said that his death was a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: “It has caused tremendous pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake, following the start of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was demanding – an investigation over a limited and limited period of time – we might have a little unity," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the commission is about to "disintegrate", amid a partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the temporal factor.
It is only five weeks until the November 6 election - if, as is expected, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to place the one they want winner in the country's highest court election will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush kept making calls to the Senators, to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through which he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to make the difference in the event of a tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korean fugitives fall under Kim
The number of North Korean fugitives in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said that about 1,127 people fled the country last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that key factors were more severe border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by those illegally transporting people across the border.
The Pyongyang has made no public comment.
A vast majority of fugitives in the north are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul officials say more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized area (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers fugitives to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for several talks that discussed negotiations on denuclearisation.
This took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused that United States sanctions caused a lack of progress since then.
"If we cannot trust the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in such situations, there is no way we will be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", saying he is unable to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee as "hysterical" and said his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday, in an interview, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal committee, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations of sexually harassing Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes he nearly screamed and lost his voice due to emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated character assassination", organised by angry Liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed Kavanaugh's testimony demonstrated that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because he showed a biased character against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if confirmed and whether Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if he doesn't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge on the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe versus Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not a good time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say "oh, how wonderful!" Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, it is months and years of accumulated anger and cannot speak without bursting into tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "I received significant help from a woman who was in an executive position, who told me that she too was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "You might think I was sad, because you see me crying.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing."
Tears are allowed for the outwardization of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I began to cry because of an inexpressible anger, is that I was grabbed by the back of the head by an older woman, a cold director towards whom I always felt a little bit of fear, and took me to the stairwell.
"She must never see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad they caused that feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought she had no reason not to run for president herself.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone referred to the situation as "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign was on end, she was behind on the fundraiser and swore she would not enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She learned that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they were only giving her $250.
"Do they think I get discounts?" she asked herself.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by emotions – as a result of gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that she lost her voice due to emotions.
"You would have said I was having a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls about press reactions to her.
"You would have said one of my sponsors was Kleenex."
I remember thinking about what they'd say on my tombstone.
"Did he cry?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
The rescues that announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening and, although there seems to be a long way to go before it ends, quarrels between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively applying taxes to half of all goods in China reaching the territory of the United States.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently imposing a fee of between 5 and 10% for US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly ceding to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, United States pressures on trade war could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would in fact be more dangerous than what has been expected so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security (Center for New American Security), a group of experts.
Syria ready for refugee return, Foreign Affairs Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help in rebuilding the country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, on-site conditions are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to get things back to normal.
Existing conditions allow refugees to voluntarily return to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at everyday life and their livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National at the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded their sixth consecutive defeat in Europe and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned to first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved 14.5 points, needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who has made incredible efforts in much of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial kick in the water to the 3rd hair at the 16th hole, yielding the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all innings, becoming one of four players with a result of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament has existed, since 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost at holes 5 and 4 to last-placed player in the European team, Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen.
The first-place player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost at holes 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter, which was probably his last match in the Ryder Cup.
A Ryder Cup veteran, who participated in eight editions, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most wins, averaging 25.5 points in his entire career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It's teamwork and I'm glad I could be of help," Garcia said, excitedly, after the European victory.
It hands him the relay to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game, on Sunday.
"I am very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to watch his matches when I was a kid," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Throughout the weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played extraordinarily throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of them, they really did try.
This morning, there were a few moments when we put pressure on the European team.
We've had a hell of a fight.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to give them the proper respect.
They played better than us."
