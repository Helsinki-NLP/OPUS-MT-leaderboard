UN chief says no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon states that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that has lasted for nearly five years and more weapons would only aggravate the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN chief again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a conference that he plans to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries on the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - this month on the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "made this situation unsolvable".
Ban asked the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they were able to reach an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 poll figures showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called it a joke.
And others await implosion.
However, regardless of how some Republicans try to knock Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it has not worked (yet).
Ten out of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump is leading by a two-digit percentage and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate mogul's naming chances.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for the Republican nomination.
Pundits shows that, during the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance was making room for Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons they would fight hard in the general election are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting it with money.
Here are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that real estate mogul is not just a fleeting thing:
Figures indicating support for Trump returned to 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy, in mid-June, a survey by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
In early August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures shall be maintained.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favourable opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for the nomination.
In a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiastic" or "thankful" if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if Trump won the race for the nomination.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiastic" over 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
Closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other side, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if favorite Jeb Bush wins the race for the nomination.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temper a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters nationwide believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to the poll conducted Monday by the ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in the state of Iowa, where also 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be the leader, according to the poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% believe that he does not have the personality to act effectively and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temper does not belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, at the question of who has the best chance of winning the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed from the end of July, when four out of 10 would bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters have not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry to the race for the nomination, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even though the Republicans have retreated to another candidate, Trump is still at the top of everyone.
Some voices say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump's victory, while supporting Trump will split by more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, almost always Trump will benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points each from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him?
Ben Carson would defeat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they have decided.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters supporting Trump say they are not changing their voting option.
Obviously, much can happen in this regard, and no one can say that they will never change their minds.
46% state that they leave the loophole open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but is twice as likely as voters who say they have decided to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the immigration issue.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violators" in his campaign opening speech, two months ago, immigration has been the central topic in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a split between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will damage rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it looks like as long as the immigration issue stays in the spotlight, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration at the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of the Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to the survey conducted Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at Washington authorities.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of Republicans in the Congres, with 54% declaring themselves "dissatisfied" and 21% "nervous at the top".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his Prime Ministry's Questions debut
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, would later make his Prime Ministry's Questions debut, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions he is entitled to shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely analysed by the media and Labour MPs.
In weekly appearances, he called for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said he could give up a few participations and give them to his colleagues.
The confrontation would be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test in the lead position, coming after calling a "ghost cab" and after the speech he gave Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's decision to remain silent at the national anthem at a service held Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England drew criticism from conservative MPs and kept headlines.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he "reserved silence respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, said for the BBC's Two's Newsnight show that he would have recommended that the Labour leader sing the national anthem "no matter" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leading team, arguing through differences of opinion related to the economy, defence and foreign, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says policy differences are "cumulating" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment regarding his position towards the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would make changes that would completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
Hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party "is very clear" in exclusive opposition to government plans to reduce the "head" level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced at the grandstand in the past decade, since he took over the Conservative Party leadership.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to ask Mr Cameron and that he has received over 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentarian Islington North said that PMQs involve too high a level of confrontation and would refrain from aftershocks and attacks, committing to focus instead on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the Minister of Finance, would be filling in for him at PMQs when he cannot attend - for example when Mr Cameron is moving abroad.
He also voiced the idea that he would allow other colleagues to speak on occasion, saying he had approached House of Deputies Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to drop the "Punch and Judy" political style often associated with PMQs, however he admitted a few years later that he had failed in his approach.
Since the first transmission, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, how he runs the Chamber of Deputies and his position among fellow MPs, although critics say it has become a caricature and that it needs a deep reformation.
"Framework in Joburg": Homeless young people benefit from photography courses
It's difficult to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as a child found a way to learn a trade and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take photos of areas they live in and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the project's first graduates.
JD Sports Chief Says Higher Wages Could Harm Enlargement
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says an increase in minimum wage in the UK could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, the purchasing power is unlikely to exceed higher labour costs within the firm, he says.
Costs could impact JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve praise and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was collateral damage in the "storm" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior rather deserves praise and not criticism, in the opinion of Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was unpleasantly dragged into the spotlight by the scandalous skid Kyrgios had towards Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tour.
In a fierce qualifying match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair umpire had to intervene twice to break up Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison stated, "Wawrinka should have knocked Kyrgios down, and I should have knocked this kid down."
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after having muscle cramps and missing a possible US Open tour, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was strongly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
"One thing I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was drawn a bit into the conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he is not the first player to break a missile out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he would not be proud of it.
But let's face it, he's mastered himself extremely well in fairly challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got a great team, he's got a great family next door, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, works hard and has integrated into the team, had no conflict with the other players, is highly respected in the locker rooms, is training hard, is in excellent shape, is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and flaws.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the important draw match, which begins on Friday, and described the "joint decision" as the most suitable for all, but supported the long-term return of Canberra-born player to the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw match and not think at all about the controversy surrounding [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick went up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he's growing up in front of the public and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs a time when he's not in the spotlight to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and him.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is second, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in choosing them than supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the poll conducted by CBS news last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has shrunk.
Support among men has been considerably reduced and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, being now tied with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has the upper hand among the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders, with a two-digit percentage among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point lead in the group.
About half of the nationally Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and a further 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton's current supporters are enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the first ranked, Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why they would want her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this position (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these issues and eligibility is also mentioned.
Given that the vice president is considering a possible presidential run, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although a third believe he should not run.
At the question on the second option for the party's representative, Democratic voters mostly appoint Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half state that Biden would be the second option, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic party race, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however the figures fell from 78% last month.
Biden is in second place at a distance but the percentage that is most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important in an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer problems to eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic or possible candidate is seen by these voters as unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or possible candidates are doing well in terms of a few key features to their party's primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and reliable and having solid leadership qualities.
Biden is best seen of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrity and reliable, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion of him on this.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
On all these issues, about a quarter of Democratic voters do not have an opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist regarding Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the subject and say it did not affect their general opinion of the candidate.
However, things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion split in March on the subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy did not affect their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion in a negative way.
Mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their view of Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton to be integrity and reliable, this issue continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider her to be integral and reliable, 8% fewer than last month and 15% fewer than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it integrity and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at national level do not consider Trump upstanding and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be upright is greater than those who disagree, however, as with Carson, many do not have an opinion of him.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five fraternity members indicted for killing student in year 1 at Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members at the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed taking him to hospital, which contributed to his demise, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was blindfolded, was put in the back of a 14 kg bag full of sand and was repeatedly bullied while attempting to head towards a target, on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call the emergency number after he passed out and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they found the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, president of the fraternity nationwide, to seek his advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide their personal belongings and basically put the good of the brotherhood ahead of the good of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
Couldn't be resuscitated and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been devastated by fraternities rituals, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year due to rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's family lawyer, in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Monroe District Grand Jury recommended that the top five members be charged with third-degree murder.
Thirty-two other members of the fraternity, including Mr Meng, will also be indicted for assault and complicity in the murder.
"We want to hold accountable not only to the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or unofficially, we will also hold it accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local dealership.
Here's what's gonna happen when the Federal Reserve raises the interest rate
The interest rate will increase and the bull market (growing market) will stumble, the return on bonds will increase and the economy will go into recession.
That's what we know.
What we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history provides little indication of time frame..
After the first increase would interest rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggression of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
Therefore, U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start to increase the interest rate but on the trajectory of the time needed for normalisation.
Indeed, there are multiple variables in the game.
However, in the end, market players may find that all the agitation over the interest rate increase has been exaggerated.
"The first interest rate increase decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the "cheap money" era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still small levels to constitute the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Here is how several sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation faced by the market in recent months, anticipation of the interest rate increase may volatilise things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for the return on capital to stall for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the phase in monetary policy again," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed increases.
More specifically, in the last 35 years, the market has grown sharply - by about 14 percent - towards interest rate growth, quite invariable in the 250 days period after (average climb of 2.6%) after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said that the impact on the shares tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and benefits begin to decline.
The recession is a reality of economic life but interest rate growth often contributes to it.
In the current situation, the Fed is facing conditions that did not exist before and could speed up a recession.
Specifically, gross domestic product will approach its historic minimum point for a Fed interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, out of the 118 interest rate increases after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even though in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, with the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
The interest rate increase in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time it is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing all year for a growth decision from the Fed, with all eyes aimed towards this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate during this meeting, short-term transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
"In our study conducted after 1950, all interest rate growth cycles to date have been in a super cycle of profit growth, with GDP eclipsing peaks before the recession very quickly after recovery began," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster on bonds than on shares when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it appears that the benefits change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease of the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate cycle, the return on bonds decreases immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategies believe that these interest rate increases will bring profitability closer between short-term and long-term bonds, flattening the curve.
High-efficiency bonds do better in such an environment, although "we are still cautious about forcing profitability," said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst within Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and the decline in estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is fairer, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed tightens policy.
Overall, companies operating mostly in the US will benefit from the interest rate increase and local products will become more attractive.
High-debt multinationals will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to the increase in their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality" stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate increase," said analyst Goldman Sachs in a report to customers.
Firms with strong balance sheets exceeded those with a poor balance after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate increases by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital and low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with a low quality, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Duty will become an important matter.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the increase in the dollar.
Those who save could also benefit, although experts disagree about how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "fooling"
It states that it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took note of the BBC Music Awards, stating that they plagiarized the Brits Awards
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, stating that this show is not original either
BBC Radio 3 is "transforming into" Classic FM, an important MP said, putting pressure on the station to prove that it is doing something that commercial stations are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that the public radio station "fools" and increasingly resembles the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 is "stupid" - although I don't like to use the word - but I do have the impression that it is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took note of the BBC Music Awards, released last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, appear to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what already exists on the market," Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director General denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of its commercial opponent on live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out anywhere about the classical music I hear from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important the commitment of Radio 3 to discover new music and allocate new songs," he said.
In the early part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to make more efforts to attract audiences from the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element under the BBC logo criticised during the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport committee for following in the footsteps of its trading rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show bought by the BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for around £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about the show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George on the jury - be performed "in a BBC-specific manner."
He added that he wanted that Corporation to "find the golden-egg chicken in its own backyard" the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the takeover of new seasons of The Voice in the future or to spend money going on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales saw the lowest increase in August and could be Black Friday's fault
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month there has been the slowest growth since 2000 to the present.
Online sales took off three years ago, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to shop.
Experts believe that the November Black Friday could cause reluctance to spending.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned UK shopping streets into ghost towns.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total of money spent in August has shown the lowest increase since 2000 to date, with an increase of only 5% in the past year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are shrinking, with the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we look at the level of growth in previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago, when buyers began using the mobile phone to shop.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could shop online and could do it under various circumstances, such as from the couch.
But now that it's stalling a little bit, you might notice a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is referred to as one of the reasons for declining sales.
According to specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases ahead of the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers crowded in front of computers to get their hands on offers, which led to the collapse of several retailers' websites.
Specialists believe that Black Friday, when buyers fought over bargains, could cause buyers' reluctance.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 of every £5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made via online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After sanctioning Bin Laden family, Muslims bury victims killed following Mecca crane crash
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked through the streets by Muslims, with the first funeral taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured following crane crash
In the walking ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed due to a crashed crane at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who mourned their dead joined on the way to express their condolences, until the first dead reached the end of the final journey, at Al-Moassem Cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just days ago a construction crane collapsed through the mosque ceiling, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for burial after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the Bin Laden family's construction group for disaster, which also resulted in 394 wounded.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a crane crashed at the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, of Bolton, Great manchester, on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane was not in operation.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group bears partial blame for the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not present the detail, but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
The Binladin group has not yet made statements about the crane collapse and Group representatives could not be contacted for the statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated safety measures and not coordinating its work with the weather authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is running major construction projects.
The last Al Qaida leader, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegated" son, disinherited by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in conditions of strong wind and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities decided that relatives of deceased victims would receive one million Saudi Rials (£174,000) and the same amount would be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
Two offers have already appeared on the banking market to convert loans into Swiss francs in lei, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come in a few years, when variable interest can lead to higher rates.
Banca Transilvania has just completed the process of converting loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data compiled by FinZoom financial portal analysts, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest rate on lei, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, the offer to convert Banca Transilvania was accepted by 83% of the customers with loans in francs due to the second successive discounts: the balance was reduced by the amount of risk and management fees paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to what they paid equivalent monthly in lei before conversion.
Thus, Banca Transilvania reduces the rate by 42.5% and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of covresia in lei of loans in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer being protected from future increases of franc, and the credit will be repaid in the currency in which he collects his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no reassessment of the property, no additional guarantees are required and no other proof of income.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit, nor will there be any additional costs as in the case of refinancing.
Also, both banks offer a discount on the monthly rate, compared to how much customers paid before conversion, equivalent to lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years consists more of interest, and the client repays very little of the principal.
The Bancpost offer with very low interest rates in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
But it is not known how this interest will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so on total, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all credits in MDL with variable interest is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly over the next years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs may occur, not mentioned in the original offer.
The time has come for interest rate decisions for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world points to the meeting scheduled in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision on whether or not to increase the interest rate for the first time after about a decade.
In a poll conducted by Reuters with 80 economists, just over half of whom last week believed the decision would be taken, I now believe the situation will continue for a while and interest rates will be kept within the current range of 0-0.25%.
It is a historic event because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop the zero rate and initiate a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, with recovery bringing trillions of dollars into balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve must not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
Stars who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia and in 2009 he lost his lifelong partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor is also rumored to have faced the drug problem and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this is definitely at a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw sits on the bench for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended in a loss to PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred following reckless intervention from Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after Shaw, 20, hacked the PSV defense.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal stated, "He has a double fracture in his leg and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow then operated on in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he's having difficulties, then he's playing fantastically, and now this is happening.
He was in the locker room wearing his oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but on double fracture rest is six months and will not play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno apparently got lucky and got rid of the red card and the concession of a penalty kick.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it's foul and red card.
It was a very ugly, two-legged intervention.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I don't have words to express how weak I feel, start the road to recovery, I'll come back stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw injury in PSV defeat
England's team quarterback has one more reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very nasty injury."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to injury an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg playing for the Mexico national team against the Netherlands national team led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see it.
I could only see the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] had touched it but I could not see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it's like, I know how difficult it is to go through something like this.
I feel so stupid, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth has clearly risked England's omission but he's still holding on.
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, however, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not consider a 3-0 defeat repeat in test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate the possibility of an away win.
Alastair Cook's team may have less experience than three years ago but has good players on the spin in the batting line and collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the 2012 happenings but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even though unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Similar topics: Adam Lyth left England's team for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Clearly, as his head coach at Yorkshire, it is difficult for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth as the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good strikers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are judged by the results.
There were no question marks related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this previously - players are their own selectors.
About fifty years and perhaps Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope that if he makes more runs for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England team head coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even when the performance was not fit to his ability and I am not surprised by this; first of all, he is a team man.
It is hard to answer the question in how long a batsman is noted in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton got lucky at home and away.
The only dissatisfaction you can have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in full shape - but that missed opportunity is a thing of the past.
On the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman I count very well.
He is a cricketer who has the "X factor" and whom I noted early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him but this will of course depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea was launched for Moeen to open up to bat alongside Cook, which would lead extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have no objection.
I don't see why a pitcher couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already proved he's a hell of a shot.
Moeen may not have brought success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Test 38 games as a first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age - with an average of 31 on batting and 35 on the ball - and they might think he's punt, but there are not a lot of spinners and the selectors opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tour.
England also made some changes to the coaching team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Sri Lankan batsman, as consultant for test matches could be a master shot.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he played in every situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they send messages that have been transmitted previously, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes rests for the one-day matches, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not all agree, coaches and selectors do not make the schedule.
And you have to remember, the players' jobs depend on the results they achieve.
Such decisions are never made lightly.
Brexit camp could win if the economy stays calm until 2017
Every day, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets more and more entangled, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn at the helm of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have characters such as Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained in the past days that - sunk in crises similar to that in the EU - not all of which have been internally provoked - some Member States are fuelled by Britain's agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, the TUC decided that they did not want this either if it eroded social protection.
We might even call it Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and say they have won allies for the reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain with outward perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that several obtuse ministers and officials in certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been in charge for 10 years and wishes to leave the position before her situation staggered, as had happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who stayed too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a leftist one.
It is hard to believe that they will help the posing Englishmen, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - something they do not want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even intentionally plan to make remarks that do not help, in the SNP style, in the campaign for the UK referendum in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation was fixed" and "Great Britain gained nothing of value from renegotiation".
Europeans know on their own how captivating Fleet Street can be and how skeptical the oligarchic barons who regard the EU with skepticism are, as they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn which ratified our 1973 entry into the 2:1 report.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the Euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 90s when he was a correspondent of Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of unpaid tax-paying rogues, foreigners who were telephone fraud and pseudo non-domes who own most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them about the same way but realized that when you're locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's idea of a referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who friendlyly touched my back on Monday at Westminster - I told him not to waste any more time with me - seems to be in danger of egging Murdoch's strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 80s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left it vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I would call evolution leniently.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most those who disagree with the Conservatives' "anglicism" might agree to that.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and TV this week, when the scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as a "shadow" minister on financial matters was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father struggled on TV to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his office in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and MPs at Monday night's private meeting.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey - remember, it also touched me - the discipline of messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the whirlpool of social networks, an outbreak of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to grant Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take the Labours' support for the referendum campaign for good, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophism about EU membership - consistent with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for whom the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophism on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that the JC will not campaign for renunciation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to Britain when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the poor military performance of the English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticise England's Department of Public Health decision on e-cigarettes
According to researchers, claims by a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some with links in the tobacco industry.
Specialists on the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing evidence used by the England Department of Public Health (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of evidence."
Several researchers, however, questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the "extraordinarily fragile base" on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in the BMJ questioned their claims and foundation "on solid ground or on quicksand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, stated: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said they expected that PHE claims that "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In reality, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) summarizing their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company titled EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was said to have received funding in the past from British American Tobacco for conducting an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not funding that is reported to have been received from the cigarette and tobacco manufacturing company, Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which panel members were selected but among them are some known "frontiers" in electronic cigarette production, some of whom even declare industry funding in the paper.
Other meeting participants are not known for their tobacco control expertise.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the PHE tobacco control section.
The group's elaborate research work "convincingly obscures" the fact that there is "solid evidence missing about the harmful effect most products have according to most criteria", McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell have stated that PHE claims that "so far there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes constitute a factor encouraging smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the health department at PHE, says that there has been a response in the past to claims in BMJ.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One in two people who have smoked their whole lives loses their lives because of this addiction.
All evidence suggests that the risk of e-cigarettes for health is comparatively minor, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
The EHP has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that arises and that does not arise from the evidence, especially in view of the high degree of public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to a disease associated with smoking and the annual costs incurred by the national health system due to smoking reach £2 billion.
Clearly expressing the current evidence - namely that while the use of electronic cigarettes is not without risks, it only presents a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
UK arms trade disgraced ads
Watch the film made by Amnesty International against the weapons fair.
Terrible killer drones!
Beasts for crushing ankles!
Disperse bombs!
And electric sticks that cause creepy pain without leaving any marks!
The cheerful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a fierce charade, performed by Amnesty International to emphasize the British authorities' desire to sell arms to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCel Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign has also led to a large number of posters being displayed in bus stations and subway stations that need a second look.
"Important announcement, travel with DLR between September 15 and 18?" says one of the ads, using London metro fonts and branding, with the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will pounce on DLR Customers are asked to contribute to stopping the weapons fair.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum, in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using the "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 Allen key pack that it states "facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in bus stations on the planet."
London transport directorship is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of flywheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and looking to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists are moving towards collaboration with activists in protest movements, realizing they need to go out into the real world for their art to impact society.
Another poster against the arms trade welcoming commuters traveling by metro.
Amnesty's film had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the advert for the armament fair - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with the making of a more realistic advertisement however "riching it with powerful animations and colors, it was more striking".
"They did a great job helping us increase interest in selling illegal torture equipment within the fair," Tom Davies says on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative art form on the topic of the weapons fair comes from inside the ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab leaked an order received from the U.S. military regarding "AT4CS RS with shoulder-backed launcher."
This includes "a unique-shaped warhead that provides stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules to Live in the Home
It has been 11 years since I moved into the dorm, when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but only now do I remember the forced smiles of those I was annoying - and the numerous complaints about others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving to the dorm can bring states that range from nervous breakdown to horror.
The chatter is tempting: to tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year's break from studies, how you feel about Corbyn and why "honestly, it's indifferent to Marmite because, really guys, it's nothing but HAHAHA yeast extract, you find me in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from the ones you wouldn't be talking to even if the flood came and they were the only ones who would have boats.
Don't choke people.
Bedrooms often abound with drinking parties, movie evenings and social gatherings, but they are also the place where people dress up and try on their underwear.

Introverts get special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom is supposed to be a refuge, but many homes build a culture of dormitory, based on friendship, socialization and lifelong friendships.
All of this can be terrible for someone trying to charge their batteries.
None of this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want us to stay friends but I want you to leave to get back the energy I consumed by interacting with you."
Try to notice when a colleague is exhausted from socializing - and try texting instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy who lived in the same dorm with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen enough things.
Make friends by cooking.
Since you're starting university in Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get acquainted and carry a plate of brownies, it seems less weird, less like the situation in the 50s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked you something, now smile and I ask personal questions."
Homemade goodies are a great way to make friends.
Your colocaters will feel compelled to talk and might end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Obviously, you must be a good cook.
Flour, sugar, and fat lumps will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock.
Food theft is a common offence in student dormitories.
Obviously, stealing someone's chicken is stealing, but taking a drop of milk to put in your tea is stealing?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to help yourself even if it boils on the inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and I understand you -- you're still trying to tackle the problem more maturely than my roommate, who colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noise that does not let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it's common sense, but because you literally walk on shards.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to turn the music down because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to turn the music up.
When they finally turned off the music, at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let them sleep for two hours before turning on the maximum music, she locked the door and left on the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/wife moved on the same floor?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely strange if you mistook a fellow floorman for your future husband, hooked up, broke up, and had to meet every day and maybe even watch him take over all your mutual friends?
Of course, you can't resist the heart - but if a sexy fellow floorman is certainly not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
At the thrilling moment when you realize that someone has left their keys in the room unlocked, the line between hoax and intimidation is finer than it looks.
A good prank is fun, but it can distort in a few moments.
You teach a fun and valuable safety lesson by hiding something - but never soil someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but don't stick someone's goods to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: There were no world tours in Bach's era.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, quite "strange", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance on Sunday, where the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one Monday, when the cellist Xavier Phillips was at the forefront, the works composed by Enescu being inexhaustible.
Both performances, performed on the stage of the Athenaeum, showed the public a different way of performing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classical musical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra - talk of instrumentalists, and not composers.
They're formed as "specialized workers."
They think they need a conductor.
On the other side of the stage, for the public, all musical fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so, the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
Therefore, we are no longer talking about music.
So if we look at this world, we have skilled workers on the one hand, which is stupid, and an audience that can't listen, but has to watch, which is stupid again," David Grimal considered.
The violinist recounts that this change in the way he makes music came from the "musical deceptions" of his career as a soloist.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found creativity and human brotherhood in this system.
So, I found no point in continuing on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at the time no one did this without a conductor: "The musical world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do you imagine doing marketing with a collective of musicians in which there is no ego anymore?" asks the artist.
David Grimal admits that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the ensemble, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be a hindrance in the musical act: " Curiously, the more complex we play a repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role", Grimal said, adding that at the Sunday show "we were 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's view, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave" one, precisely because it invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where the world's largest orchestras are present and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you also invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there was place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist admits to feeling the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu in his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this is what happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal advocates the change in the way classical music education is made, considering that "the work of musician, as it is organized today, has a death wish" and that "the future of music represents music itself".
We don't need to tour the world five times a year if it doesn't do any good.
In Bach's era there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, the organization of concerts, festivals, tours, album releases, they are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are performed in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, it has no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example to Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
To enter the EU you had to adopt health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture end up in the service of supermarkets, as in France.
With music the same thing happens, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes tomatoes may not be too beautiful, but when we cut them are real tomatoes.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If we considered - as Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce his learning in school, we would reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products," Grimal believes.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will play an instrument, being first of all a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) it must be in some way, if we want to form a musician, it is something else entirely.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?" asks the French artist smiling.
Grimal looks like, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes all the way from overcoming this "soldier" status, overcoming what "they think are their limits": "Musicians discover at a certain point that they are not soldiers, and that's why after the concert they come out smiling".
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.
David Grimal profile
After attending the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique in Paris under the guidance of Regis Pasquier, during which time he received advice and encouragement from renowned artists such as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed the course of his life.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, along which he has regularly performed in the last 20 years on the main classical music scenes of the world and with prestigious orchestras such as the Orchestra de Paris, the Orchestra Philharmonique de Radio France, the Russian National Orchestra, the National Orchestra de Lyon, the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphony, the New Japan Philharmonic, the Orchestre de l'Opera de Lyon, Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and the Sinfonia Warsaw, under conductors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schínwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos and Peter Eotvos, Andris Nelsons, Christian Arming.
He was the recipient of works with dedication from several composers, including Marc-Andre Dalbavie, Brice Pauset, Thierry Escaich, Jean-Francois Zygel, Alexander Gasparov, Victor Kissine, Fuminori Tanada, Richard Dubugnon, Ivan Fedele, Philippe Harrowing, Anders Hillborg, Oscar Bianchi, Guillaume Connesson and Frederic Verrieres.
In addition to his career as a solo artist, David Grimal also wanted to explore more personal projects.
The freedom that his collaboration with Les Dissonances offered him allowed him to develop his inner universe by adventure into repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Alongside Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Saison", a series of concerts given for the benefit and along with the homeless at the church of Saint-Leu, in the heart of Paris.
Since 2008, David Grimal has been Artist in Resident at the Dijon Opera House.
He taught violin classes at the Musikhochschule in Sarrebruck, Germany.
He also holds many mastery classes and was a member of the jury of the Long-Thibaud International Competition in Paris in 2010.
He received the Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres distinction from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal played on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" from 1710, but also on "Don Quixote", a violin designed for him by French luthier Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal attended this year's George Enescu International Festival with the Les Dissonances Orchestra on Sundays, including Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also climbed the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the hottest challenge for children: doubling two characters from the super production "Snow Queen 3D"
You have a super-talented, spontaneous kid who likes movies?
Give him a chance to be a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children who are eager to become future stars and who are between 8 and 16, Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If the classic drawings focused on the actor's voice approaching the specifics of the animated character, in recent times, the creation of the story also takes into account those who are to perform the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are starting a new campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge our parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are cute and the lines are funny.
"The children will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the contest, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organizes a pre-selection following which 10 children will be elected (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to audition in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the smallvocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where to score the child in the contest and prepare him for the voice challenge.
Subsequently, he must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will register by performing his own version of dubbing.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can choose contestants to support the challenge: "Yellow Feathers 3D", "Mune: Guardian of the 3D Moon", "Blinky Bill: Koala the Naughty 3D" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double one character from the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Snow Queen 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx gains mixed, tax forecasts for 2016 drop
FedEx declared disappointing results for the last quarter, with the delivery giant reducing profit estimates for the year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares fell by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the opening bell sound on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said he expected to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of next year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts expected the figure of $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The declining estimate comes despite rising prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on January 4, and higher surcharges for land transportation of large or heavy-weight packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects gains from the previous year as a result of cost cuts, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Managing Director Fred Smith said that "the firm is facing a considerably weaker economic situation than expected, especially in terms of global production and trade."
Employment plans during the holidays were announced one day after UPS contestant said he intended to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number of employment he did last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the poll conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks poll estimated $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipments, leading to revenue stagnation recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping lifted the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the revenue of the ground division increased by 29% but operational revenues stagnated virtually due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher basic tariffs, while the revenue recorded by the Freight division fell due to rising costs.
On pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had dropped $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
Tuesday on closure had dropped 11% year-wide and 17% from the record peak recorded on June 11.
On the occasion of the most expected meeting in recent years, policy makers within the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether the time has come to increase a key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank meeting room, a United States mural will be seen.
The map is meant to recall that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and his colleagues must put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The Central Bank received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the U.S. and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be debated by the unprecedented incentive offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in effect as of late 2008.
Even though most of the data points to a strong growing economy, recent agitation in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials from adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even by only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main issues they will pursue," Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I think, however, that if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the growing uncertainty on the world market is enough to give them arguments to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on the Fed's decision, which itself causes instability in the financial market.
About half of economists recently questioned by Bloomberg anticipated an interest rate increase this week.
But financial markets expect the Fed to postpone, with a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall on the stock exchange if the Fed increases the interest rate, unless policymakers would mitigate the blow by promising that it would be a long time before the next increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The wind was triggered by expectations that Fed policy makers would keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for the Fed to raise the interest rate at this point," Lonski said.
If Fed makers were to do so, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets".
Other experts said an increase in the interest rate would calm financial markets as it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared to be about to increase the rate by 0.25 percent this month, the first small step towards slowly tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the force of U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that he expected an interest rate increase this year despite objections raised by liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth was strong this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the Fed's total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to fail to reach the central bank's annual target, Fed decision-makers said that a key reason was the temporary effect of sharply declining oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to fibrillate later this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 16% below the record peak reached in May, as investors feared that slowing down the Chinese economy would pull down world growth.
The market has somewhat recuperated this month, with the Dow index now being about 10% below its May peak.
For Fed policy makers, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the moment of interest rate increase.
"Without what has happened in financial markets and news of the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, they would be more firm at the sitting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now he predicts they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and they almost have no data to rely on after the events in China," said Oliner.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the major interests of the Fed, so it should practically not be taken into account in decision making.
In reality, however, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been huge.
The mere allusion of the then President, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly linked, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor progress in other areas but also to consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department at the welfare management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has an oversized reaction history to changes in the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic bases."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the interest rate increase, provided as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that affected Asia caused the Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the implications with limited identification for US development," said Lacker.
A year later, Fed officials returned to their respective declines.
The Fed should only put financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting committee.
The last hectic period is nowhere near rising to that level, he said.
"We certainly do not want to end up in a situation of fearing an increase in the interest rate because the markets were upset," said Posen, president of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in that respect, I do not think it should take premature action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates polls, despite Nine's attempts to broadcast on Today Show about changing party leadership
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's urgent move to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes at the Liberal party leadership did not bring a significant increase in audiences for Today.
The Nine Canal morning broadcast broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat to Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise show, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was caught in London as part of a series of broadcasts run over several weeks, which also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This "cruelty" of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today saw a slight increase compared to Monday's (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000) ratings were lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the difference from Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged from 40,000 to 50,000.
For now, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened throughout the morning.
This morning, it is not just Parliament that is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The main news story was the startling debut of the 800 Words series starring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, subject to a recently widowed father, who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience, of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson was able to face a show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Audience results for last night answered resoundingly that "yes".
The X Factor show broadcast by Seven held in position, with 1,136 million viewers, easily taking the face of The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000) shows.
Seven recorded ups and downs the second night he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new general culture show averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia's show had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure, of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia's ratings in the second evening will give Nine tacit confidence that Hot Seat will finally triumph at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to defeat McGuire's show.

4 people lost their lives after police fired rubber bullets at Nepal protesters
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, district police chief, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw molotov rocks and cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after which they fired shots into the air before resorting to the use of rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in violent clashes triggered on August 10,
when four key political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in centrally governed Nepal for hundreds of years.
The procedure for drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted on clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns
The prime minister continues to exchange lines with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of Wednesday's government meeting, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all the institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania disagrees and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fences or armed policemen.
"It is a shame for Europe's 21st century to apply methods from the 30s." said Victor Ponta
"The prime minister also said that all data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and set at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the prime minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% cyclone probability south of Cape Verde Islands
An extensive low pressure front about 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands is 60% likely to turn into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and Lesser Antilles is also 60% likely to form a tropical cyclone over the next two days, Miami meteorologist added.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for mildly obese diabetics
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say if mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight loss surgery than those who are undergoing non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgeon, which she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also referred to as bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce hunger sensation and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people with morbid obesity with a 35 or higher body mass index (BMI).
BMI, a unit of weight measurement relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used the data collected after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI in people undergoing surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments against diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36% and partly at 28%.
In the medically treated group, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1% and partly in just 2% of subjects.
Additionally, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group", the authors concluded.
Researchers also monitored the blood haemoglobin level of A1c, which reflects the blood glucose level over time.
Researchers write that the optimal A1c haemoglobin level is below 7%.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9% to about 6%.
But in the medically treated group, it was maintained at about 8%.
But this improved "globe control" - reflected by improved levels of A1c hemoglobin - did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the sleeve gastrectomy group, the bypass surgery group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), had more marked decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and A1c haemoglobin (3.1% versus 2.1%) and were more likely to have complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on high-weight people in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, Blackstone, of Arizona University, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix says.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were approximately 29% less likely to die after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was an optimistic aspect for people with BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point where this work is critical, because it states that this surgery is safe in the lower BMI group," without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously then the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we urge people to take this issue seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shorted out their bodies by predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhist has sent out an appeal to end violence in the mother countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of refugee crisis in the speech he gave at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even every continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The concern for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but we must think at the same time of long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, to Muslim countries," he stressed.
After all, we need to think of ways to reduce crimes in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Regarding the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, stating that the violent response from the U.S. generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of September 11, I sent my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, U.S. anti-poison centers reported an increase of around 400% as of 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed hand detergent with high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Georgia Anti-Poison Center, cases of hand detergent ingestion in children under the age of 12 reported at anti-poison centres went from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez stated that some children intentionally drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
Movies that feature teenagers drinking detergent to create cheap drinks can be watched on YouTube.
The teenagers apparently mixed the detergent with mouthwash with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted by the attractive smell of detergent.
"A child doesn't think he's hurting her," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are those fragrant.
Strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand cleaners are the most attractive to children.
Hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poison center at Kansas University Hospital, for channel Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand cleaners in accessible places and if the little ones reach them, this is a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four strawberry-flavored hand detergent sprays, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcoholemia 179, twice the threshold at which an adult is legally considered under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was babbling and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage, as the girl fell and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchie said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic wet products or napkins and no longer leave hand detergent out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing an unreported toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth graders in northern New York plotted to poison their "bad" teacher "putting antibacterial products in the classroom", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned him in his classroom.
Police considered the plan to be "unsignificant" and referred the disciplinary matter to the school inspectorate.

The absence of Scots in the title race bores the Dutch - by Boer

De Boer, currently ambassador of Ajax, said, "In the Netherlands I no longer convey the summary of Celtic matches; why?"
Because there's no Rangers there.
This isn't just about Rangers coming back.
They're talking about Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that's where the interest goes.
The tension is high in Old Firm matches and it is not just the Scots who want to see these matches.
I'll change the situation, promise Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic was struggling hard, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat to Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now top of the ranking with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic have had periods before and will recover".
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
So do we - but we have to move on.
We really need Celtic's support because that also makes players better.
It is extremely important that we remain united now.
Warburton's caution over January transfers
Despite comments just weeks ago suggesting that he had identified several targets for January transfers, Rangers head Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not wish to affect the unit of the Ibrox team.
The former head of Brentford said, "The January transfer period is very different from the summer one."
In the case of players transferred in summer, there is the pre-season period in which they can be integrated, which you could see this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players that aren't necessary.
Celtic targets Michu after retirement
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested he might retire upon the expiry of his contract with the Swans.
The 29-year-old player struggled two years with ankle problems and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts confronts the SFA over Neilson's comments
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the quarterback's red card was then cancelled - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting, "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken for granted after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh ahead of a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the excitement of the moment," said the striker, adding, "No need to say that I'm not going back to Tynecastle unless I'm playing for Celtic."
Tannadice Council trusts Dundee United - Donnelly management
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United council still trusts that the management team will change the situation - but agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We will get the boys back in shape," said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy for "dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that the Aberdeen team must desperately cling to Hamilton Accies to achieve their seventh successive league victory, which earned them five points over Celtic due to the penalty kick in the first half executed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes stated, "There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and that has not won matches like this."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while UK increases
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in the May-July period, while the number of unemployed in Britain overall increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that in the UK, at 5.5%, according to figures presented by the National Statistical Office (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number of those currently employed being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said, "The long-term government plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, with employment rates rising and unemployment falling.
Why I Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
Over the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be sentenced to death.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in an observer room in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary execution room and I'll see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches, the idea terrifies me.
So, why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can witness executions in America and, because requests usually exceed the number of seats available, a macabre lottery is held to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma reduced the number of seats reserved for media representatives from 12 to five.
Those chosen will view the execution impartially.
I can't do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, plus I developed my own connection with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to carry around a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma Twittered me for compromising my impartiality.
Here's your lesson.
Tell the story of the inmate as he wishes, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that he "could have phrased it better", but is still of the opinion that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't even if she asked me.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international report to write about the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series we made.
I won't come back here to all the details.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die from that perspective.
I can't pretend to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll learn what it's like to watch a man I like die needlessly.
Peter Moody claims the stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw from racing
Peter Moody asserted that the Victoria Racing stewards tried to infiltrate a spy at his stables last year and threatened to immediately withdraw from racing.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, stating that they were running a personal campaign against him, the drop that broke the glass being the elimination of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do the best for the racing field and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result on Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed his words concerning statements about spies and did not wish to resemble "the fox that does not reach the grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that aspect and I kept quiet for a long time but sometimes you get to such a high level of frustration that everything suddenly flares up," Moody said.
It is known to have continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I'll go home and sleep peacefully.
I want to go with my head held high, and I want the owners that I work with to see that I'm trying to give them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up my job as a trainer.
At that point I'll have to think about what I'll do with my certification.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb in a given interview for racing.com in which he stated that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stables.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man - whose name I will tell if asked - and offered to hire him at my stables to provide information about the work there," Moody told Racing.com.
He obviously thinks I'm a cheater.
If so, then they should all resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at the time and know today.
Am I supposed to think this is personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start having backbones and can hold people outside trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on industry that bad?
Maybe that's how the others see it.
Maybe they need to take my license and get me out of the way and I have no doubt that the statements that I'm making now might cause them to think about this.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It makes me very sad.
I'll put pressure on it and get them to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
Trainer frustration increased with the lengthy cobalt testing investigation involving Lidari and elimination led him to state that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with training undefeated champion Black Caviar, labelled the race day treatment rule as "ridiculous" after applying a mud or clay poultice to the horses' feet, which violates the rules.
He's breaking the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which it did.
It happened the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the treatment on the day of the race consisting of applying the poultice, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who struck and fled the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist produced in Cobram late in the week and followed by the hit-and-run.
The rider was transported by helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police representatives say the driver of the vehicle did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man turned himself in to Shepparton police.
He appears to be charged with hit-and-run, non-first aid and other traffic offences.
The rider, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable state.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called criticism of the plating tactic used by his team as "distorted subjects" brought up by the two main favorites in the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to "slake them" the team in Storm's nervously won match in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's win in the qualifying game with the North Queensland Cowboys, played Saturday night, when he called the match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the tackle tactic addressed by his team and stated that players were simply focusing on "contact" when liking.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried Storm would defeat them.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything all year long in our defensive systems or techniques, only that in the last six weeks we have really put the emphasis on contact in placards and so we have changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
Funny how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football", reminding his St George-Illawarra Dragons mentor Bennett's won the championship in 2010 playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talked about how thrilling the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember, in 2010, St George received a lot of criticism because it was a boring team and Wayne stated that he was not interested in anything.
But now he has a team that can play what we would consider to be thrilling football, especially because of the fast young midfielders.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have players like that.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his playing style - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about big games.
Bellamy also highlighted that the match between Storm and the Roosters was a more fierce score-related competition compared to the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good match, haven't we seen it yet, what was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, is that exciting game?
Or exciting is taking breaks and not scoring?
They're plans for me.
If they're talking about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm has this weekend off because they have earned the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks, in the final of the preliminaries next Saturday, at AAMI Park, with tickets putting on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the little girls' phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping then logged into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indecent images having children as a subject.
The girl subsequently woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was asleep.
He looked into his phone and found the messages disturbing and then immediately alerted his mother.
After arrival, police saw the five pictures then analyzed computers found at that address and found "worrisome" searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of child subjects.
Hogg claimed to have done it to "attract pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a cop to scare them off".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court, "He said it's an addiction - that he's addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said that he did it because he wanted to impersonate a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the images and the fact that he asked the person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said that he no longer thinks clearly when he drinks and that he wishes to see images of rapes and murders.
Mr. Robertson added: "When the little girl found the messages on her phone, she cried out to her mother and was shaking and crying.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and recounted that the accused was using the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, 23, residing in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to allegations that he made or took indecent pictures of child subjects, and violated parole terms on January 25 this year and did not appear before the court at the March 24 appearance this year.
The defense attorney, Gregor Sim, demanded that Hogg not be registered in the sex offender register because it can be said that this offense "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before appearances for other files.
It was entered in the sex offenders' register before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier in the year, Mr Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell down the steps of a podium.
He was not injured, however, footage of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disrupted by representatives of the opposition who said they had received anonymous threats of death, threatening them not to boo Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they booed him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated Tuesday.
The head of the Parliamentary Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, warned against disrupting Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number however it is titled "death", he told journalists after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the MPs concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is worthless.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "worried" about the threats passed on to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 layoffs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs as part of the company's efforts to restructure and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year. HP will split into two companies, separating the computer division and printers from operations with corporate hardware and services that are growing fulminant.
Expected redundancies will bring costs of around $2.7 billion as of the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said Meg Whitman, the President and Managing Director of HP, who will lead the unit after the rift.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP currently and will hold a broad portfolio of businesses that will contribute to firms' transition to the new style of business conduct," Whitman said.
Working as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing demands of our customers worldwide.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and "focus on providing seamlessly integrated solutions" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard is being split, with the object of producing electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto has been called the "Silicon Valley cradle".
HP went through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the US, is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about male friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men peaking over the past 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Unfortunate Life (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of the Man, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2000 high school students showing symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy mood", his chances of recovery double.
To the same extent, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of mental disorders.
Of course, for friendship to work, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which affects our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money really does not buy happiness.
The beauty of the series Friends was that it turned attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they watch football in the comfortable armchairs and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even though they often shy away from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: ..."my role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often people who call on us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to handle yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term psychological adaptation mechanisms.
The series highlighted small moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, external intervention helps through the phone, people in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you attend this weekend at the FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full playback of the set to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends for coffee in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from start to finish - all 236 episodes - on the occasion of #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG to kick Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut Champions League match and helped PSG impose against Swedish team Malmo.
Next we present the chronicle of the match and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, with Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of Champions League groups matches, with a soothing 2-0 victory against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday on the Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut Champions League match in the PSG team, bringing the champions of France to the advantage although they missed a number of occasions before securing their advantage with the goal scored by the Cavani in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Chesstior Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against Swedish champions because the objective of the French team is not only qualifying in the optimists but also an improvement in the journey to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although they took the points, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the goal opportunity after which he was replaced by his hometown team and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so the 2-0 win gives our opponents problems and sets a comfortable difference from the next rankings, even though there are still aspects we need to perfect throughout the season," Blanc said.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, although I am sorry that we failed to score one or two goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury to one of three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 draw at home by Bordeaux in Liga 1 on the weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who would take the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he gushed at Marco Verratti's pass behind Malmo's defense before he incredibly shot over Johan Wiland, in the long corner to the right of the gate.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by snapping their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage and entered the field with nine national team holders, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielders, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot which passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed the pace a few times, giving a few unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five tries in the first half alone and was then replaced by Cavani just after the replay of the game.
Ibrahimovic proved much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, however, it was his pass that Di Maria sent into a deflected shot by Wiland over the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of the match passed, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic pitched from Maxwell's run.
This goal eliminated Malmo's hope that they would rebalance the score and only a superb stop by Wiland from a distance for rejecting David Luiz maintained the final score before new entrant Ezequiel Lavezzi was voided a goal in overtime.
The team's Norwegian coach in Malmo, Age Hareide, later stated that PSG were one class over and that "The last game we played in the Champions League was in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off to PSG.
They played an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by declining stock prices on the stock market, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a large debt reduction plan.
The London-listed Glencore Company said it had sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is slamming down with collapsing prices on the commodity market, because China's decline in economic activity influences demand and causes disaster in markets.
The preferential right of subscription increased the price of Glencore's shares on the London stock exchange in Wednesday morning's transactions.
Shares climbed 2.77% to 131.60 shillings to the FTSE 100 index, which opened to a 0.69% higher value.
Glencore revealed the sale of $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of wider plans to cover nearly a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 shillings per share, 2.4% less than Tuesday's closing price.
He removed 1.3 billion shares from the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the growth of the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices, by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities fell by 20-40%.
Xi urges wider global economic expansion
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with reforming that the economy must open wider to the outside world to fuel growth.
"China must commit to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said, at the 16th Meeting of the Central Leadership Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new impetus and vitality and make room for economic growth, Xi said.
The management group has adopted a number of guides, including a negative list of regulating market access, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganizing the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a legislation-based business environment and providing wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their businesses.
China will also, according to the declaration, allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and offer them better services," according to the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green cards", optimizing requirements and fluidizing the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing lawyers' right of practice and educating judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions unhappy with the Government's proposal to raise wages by 10%
The negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the trade unions in Education have not reached any results, the Government proposing a 10% salary increase, from December 1st, with payment on January 1st 2016, and the unions wanted an increase of 15%, since November, or a 20%, since December.
The talks took place at Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister of Education Sorin Cimpeanu, Finance Minister Eugen Teodorovici and Labour Minister Rovana Plumb.
Today's Government proposal did not please us, otherwise we would not have come to the position of convoking the leadership of our federations.
The 10% we were promised today is less than what we expected.
"In fact, this 10% is the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government, last year, for 2016," said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the discussions.
Ponta: In the future health and education will be the areas where we will invest all the money we have
According to him, on Thursday, there will be a meeting of the FSLI, which will also be attended by representatives of the Government to present to the representatives of the confederates in the country the proposal for a salary increase, followed by unionists deciding whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The Prime Minister also told trade unionists that the Government is trying to send the Wage Act to Parliament as quickly as possible so that it can take effect on December 1st.
The normative act provides for the increase of salaries in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the increase stipulated in the document to be made staggered, in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the unionists the full acquittal of the 2016 court sentences.
Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday after the boat they were in wrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, informs AFP, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's coast guard said it has managed to rescue 249 people who were in the wrecked boat, but their nationality is still unknown.
Previously, on Monday, two other people died while attempting to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also, on the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisisi, located 15 kilometers from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat was carrying more people than its capacity, so it was shipwrecked.
The route has become popular lately for immigrants who want to escape war and hard life from countries such as Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses, fired for being too fat
Air India is firing about 130 stewards and stewardesses for being overweight, the company announced late last week.
The state company announced that the decision was made for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the measure is "ridicola" and "shockingly sexist", writes The Washington Post.
Mass firing is the latest in a ten-year fight between the company and the busier stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began using graphs of ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired nine stewardesses considered "exceptionally overweight", as this "can have an effect on reflexes and prevent the agility needed to perform emergency measures".
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were rehired, but the company fired them again in 2009.
"All efforts to make them lose weight have failed," explained a company spokesman.
A footballer from Steaua teaches Gigi Becali: What a decision he made
A footballer from Steaua is lecturing Gigi Becali on the promotion of young players.
If the champion’s financier decided to close the Football Academy in which he had invested a considerable amount, quarterback Paul Papp opened a football school.
The "Paul Papp" Academy will operate in the town of Dej, the local kids are expected at a first selection action.
I'm extremely happy to have arrived at this stage, to start the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children who can play football without having to worry about material at training.
They must have one care: that of playing football as well.
Technical details don't have to be their concern.
They have to value their talent.
This is what Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
"I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he is with them," footballer Papp told dejeanul.ro.
Star quarterback Academy is expecting children up to 11 years old.
The whole party wants to rule.
Acting PSD President Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the party still wants to remain in power, and if the prime minister wants to, the PSD Congress will formalise the decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta expects this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we are to formalize by a congressional decision, we will do so as well.
There won't be any emotion about it.
"There were no elements, no voices in the party, no opinions in the party that would give anyone uncertainty about government or give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want PSD to remain in government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the PSD's Permanent National Bureau meeting.
PSD announced when it will hold congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the leadership's choice, a clear message be given whether to continue governing or whether the party decides to move into opposition.
Dragnea: I'll announce on Monday if I run for congressional office
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday if he will run for leadership at the upcoming Congress.
I'll weigh in on Monday after the Executive Committee if the congressional date is set.
"I will announce if I am running for party leadership," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's meeting of the PSD's National Permanent Bureau.
Asked if he was hesitant about announcing his candidacy, Dragnea said he didn't have that problem.
I don't have the problem you're referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party whether or not to announce a candidacy when the congressional date is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of Social Democratic branches proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the Party's Executive Committee.

An Italian got caught at Bors Customs with illegals holed up in the truck.
Two Sri Lankan citizens were spotted at Bors Customs on Monday while attempting to cross the border illegally, hidden in the semi-trailer of an Italian citizen's automarfary.
Following research, it was established that the two had paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, inform the Border Police.
At specific control, border guards noticed, in the truck cabin, a large travel bag, where personal belongings were found for several people, which is why they carried out a thorough inspection of the means of transport.
On this occasion, border guards discovered, hidden in the semi-trailer of the automarfare, among the plastic crates, two male persons.
From the verifications resulted that the persons concerned, two men, aged 28, are citizens of Sri Lanka and asylum seekers in Romania.
"In research, the young people said they intended to reach France, for which they contacted a national, through whom they met with the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they were to receive 2,000 euros per person," says the Border Police communiqué.
The two migrants were drafted "criminal work in terms of committing the crime of attempted state border crossing".
Also, Pompeo B., the 45-year-old Italian citizen who drove a Renault Magnum automarfare, registered in Romania, carrying plastic crates for a company in Italy, was detained for 24 hours, to be presented to the Bihor Court with a proposal for preventive arrest.
How satisfied the Romans are in couples: Men versus women
Most Romans are pleased with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of John Gray's coming to Romania, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents declared themselves 'very satisfied' and 'satisfied' with the overall quality of the couple relationship.
"However, 18% is shown to be 'slightly unsatisfied' and 'very unsatisfied' in the couple relationship, and other 18% declare 'fit'," is the study's conclusion, as shown in a remiss release, Tuesday, Newspapers.com.
The situation is a little different when the answers of men and women are analysed separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% suitable, 6% very unsatisfied and 8% slightly unsatisfied.
As far as women are concerned, 33% declared satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very unsatisfied, 14% slightly unsatisfied and 19% chose the right cathogory.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
As far as the neutral state is concerned, we see a two percent difference.
"In the same way in the very unsatisfactory situation, the biggest difference being recorded at the slightly unsatisfied answer where we see a difference of 6 percent," the communication also said.
The study also showed that a quarter of Romans (26%) spend an hour or even less time together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% spend between two and four hours.
The authors of the study also say that "Romans need some more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), safety (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, confidence 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%".
The study was conducted by Extreme Training from 1 June to 1 September on 1,369 persons, the margin of error calculated being 2.6%.
Europe has once again become a disgrace.
German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe was "embarrassed" after Monday's failure of the Brussels ministerial meeting to allocate refugees to the EU.

Earlier, the German Interior Minister, Thomas de Maiziere, suggested reducing the European Union's structural funds in the case of countries rejecting refugee quotas.
The European Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday of emergency, failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory assignment of 120,000 refugees, requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of the worst migration crises in Europe after 1945.

Thousands of people passed through the coffin with the unanimated body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people being no longer at St. George's Church except at the re-establishment of the house or at the Great feast of Saint Nicholas, said the parish priest Emil Caramizaru on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people of all ages are waiting in a row, stretching from the entrance to the church to the side streets, to pass through the cataphal on which is the coffin with the inanimate body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor.

What's going on with Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halep was faced with a decision crucial to her career, and she had to choose whether or not she would continue to collaborate with Coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year under the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being with the novelist only on important tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise to Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself in the face of capricious sports.
The Adidas program will end but at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether he will offer a consistent contract to Cahill or whether he will quit the collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We'll talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer," Simona confessed at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in current tennis, with him applying for a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last race Simona and Cahill will work together is the Champions Tournament in Singapore.
It wasn't normal. I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he broke up with Romania's national team last autumn.
The former selectioner confessed that he did not get along with FRF President Razvan Burleanu after he took Mircea Sandu's place and thus made the decision to leave the country.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but he was refused.
Right now I'm not sorry I left Nationals.
Then I was sorry, we were leaving a job behind.
That's how I felt then it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selectioner, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, my work wasn't respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he learned different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was really hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation.
We continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to leave.
If he really wanted me to stay, then I suggested an increase in the contract.
We have around 400 and some thousand euros a year, I was going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, I talked to his right hand.
"He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group," Victor Piturca said at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania in the autumn of last year, although the team had good results in Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to coach in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.
Armoured and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns on the border with Serbia after violent clashes Wednesday, when water and tear gas guns were used against immigrants seeking entry from Serbia, despite Hungary erecting a barbed wire fence.
At least 20 cops and two kids were injured in the clashes, says Russia Today.
So far 20 cops have been injured and the ambulance service has taken over two children who have been injured after being thrown over the security fence.
"We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it and protect Hungary's security by any means," Hungarian Prime Minister Gyorgy Bakondi's security adviser said.
Police tried to control with water cannons and tear gas the crowd of people who throw plastic bottles, stones and pieces of pavement.
Authorities reported that dozens of immigrants broke the fence at the crossing between Roszke and Horgos and managed to break into the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto urged Serbia to take action against "very aggressive" immigrants on the common border.
There are reports that Serbs also supplemented their law enforcement at the border.
Following Wednesday's incidents, Budapest suspended crossing from the Roszke-Horgos border for 30 days.
Hungary is in concerted action to close its borders to block the access of immigrants.
If Tuesday announced that besides the barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia it would also raise one on the border with Romania, towards the loud protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the construction of a fence on the border with Croatia.
The rare disease a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family of being an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was dizzy, he could barely stand up and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't drink alcohol, he was clearly intoxicated.
When she first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family believed 'maybe he drinks alone, he's an alcoholic in secret'," he recounts, according to the Mirror.
When he saw the footage of his wife with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, he just didn't recognize himself: "I was looking into my eyes and I wasn't there".
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
Plus, his wife, who, although she doubted him for a while, finally went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick's breath smelled like alcohol.
The moment that made Nick think most about it was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had a three-time alcohol level over the legal limit, although the night before he had only had one beer.
After years and innumerable investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffers from an extremely rare disease, Auto-brewery syndrome.
Basically, his body makes all the carbohydrates consumed ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected that this might be Nick's illness was even his wife.
The disease does not yet have a cure, but since he gave up carbs, Nick has not had such episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf club.
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he received from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf club, causing enough damage for the car to be decommissioned, transmits BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video ended up on the Internet, to the amusement of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has malfunctions that endanger his life and his family.
His anger arose when the dealer from whom he purchased the car did not solve his problem, as they had agreed.
On Wednesday, the government approved the "National Immigration Strategy for 2015-2018" and the "Actuation Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage Romania is undergoing in the framework of efforts to modernize the process of managing immigration on national territory", according to a press release.
The cited source shows that the strategy aims to effectively manage the immigration phenomenon, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action that reflect policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the states in the immediate vicinity of Romania, measures are envisaged for the unitary and coherent management of situations caused by the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants into Romania, generated by situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time, they will pay particular attention to citizens from states with potential migrationist or that may harm national security," added the source.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including maintaining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq, maintaining an unstable situation in areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out some general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous controls of the legality of the residence of citizens of third states on Romanian territory and proper application of removal measures and restrictive measures, improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy also includes specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating the access to Romania of third-party citizens who respond to employment needs, facilitating the access of third-country nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it is "a means by which concrete activities are established leading to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migrationist phenomenon".
Romania, in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the highest increase in the total labour cost of EU Member States in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the similar period, according to data published by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat) on Wednesday.
The index refers to employers' staff costs.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total labour cost rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU to increase labour costs
The largest increases were reported in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5.5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly labour cost fell in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance of labour costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase of the hourly cost of labour in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania registered a 5.8% advance on the hourly labour cost.
Activity report of TVR management rejected in commissions: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
Parliament's cultural commissions rejected on Wednesday the activity report of the Romanian Television Society's Board of Directors for 2014.
17 MPs voted to reject the report, one against rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Permanent Bureaus.
They'll probably decide next week.
The next plenary meeting will be debated.
"I think in view of this situation it will be done relatively quickly," said the chairman of the Senate Culture Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was common sense" that the TVR leadership should be present at this meeting, as no representatives of the TVR leadership were present at the meeting of the Culture Commissions.
It was common sense to have TVR management present because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to members that since last night, with an approximate hour that we did not know the time, but today, after the meeting of the bureaus, I personally sent a fax to the TVR management inviting her.
I believe that when you're summoned, you're a budget earner, paid from public taxes and you're summoned to a meeting of committees, even if you don't like living.
"Because it is your duty of service, you are in an institution under the Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the Joint Committees of the Parliament.
He added that the meeting discussed the financial aspects of the institution based on the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw continued, came up with the idea that this year it would have been up to date, but no historical payments were made.
"I remind you that it wasn't my fault or anyone else in these commissions that lost that pleasure with the banks and the IRS, that are clear management issues," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report was rejected by the meeting plenary elections would follow for a new Board of Directors, and he would elect the general director of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this position.
Wonders won't be done.
The important thing is to make political decisions for this institution to work.
I'm not his man to lie to you, to tell you that there will appear a genius who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, by their vote of Parliament, will choose with great reason the people who will lead TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on out there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities it must have - common sense in the attitude towards employees because it is a pile of petitions coming from employees, complaints, dismissals.
"When you receive such referrals 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster," the chairman of the Senate Culture Commission concluded.
Although he did not come to the Parliament, the President-General of TVR, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he asked that Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of the TV tax.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to the indexation of the TV tax, the modification and completion of HG 978/2003 on the public television service tax, in order to update the provisions at the level of technological changes to the day, as well as to regulate the procedure regarding control in the area of TV tax payment and the finding of contraventions and the application of penalties and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv trustees for collecting the TV fee, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission in receipts.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to 3%, but also for the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budget/financing allowances for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sports events - FIFA World Cup, Golden Stag, Eurovision.
He claims that SRTv will be unable to pay in the next months given that the labor legislation obliges the employer to enforce the court decisions, even if they are not definitive, and the salary rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce personnel spending and TV production.
"Thus there have been reduced movements and other cost-generating activities, a number of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and in late July TVR News has been closed," said TVR President's letter.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied simply by its own efforts.
"Without the support of state institutions - Government, Parliament, Presidency - Romanian Television will sooner or later be unable to carry out its public mission," the letter states.
The House of Deputies' leadership has decided to send the letter to the Culture Commission.
Son-in-law of Vasile Blaga, sent to trial
Vasile Blaga's son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sued on Wednesday by prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office at the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is charged with tax evasion, in a file with damage of about 600,000 euros, under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was remanded on 22 May.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, together with his mother, in April 2009, one year after marrying Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, in order to avoid paying taxes and taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been highlighted.
"In fact, the company's accounting would have registered fictitious acquisitions of services, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
The Sheiks have established the fate of Sanmartean
The Sheiks of the Al-Ittihad Club established the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announces that Sanmartean's separation from Ittihad is imminent, coach Ladislau Boloni's manager Arcadie Zaporojanu says this will never happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays match titular and does it well.
The Sheiks also realized that he is the best and that it would be wrong if they gave him up.
There would have been a better way to bring another player, but nothing came of it.
"There have been several discussions, such as with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has come to fruition," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President of the Court of Auditors
Parliament voted Wednesday to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as vice-president of the Audit Authority of the Court of Accounts.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes "for" and 108 "against" were registered.
The vote was a secret ballot.
PNL representatives were the only ones to vote against this proposal, Digi24 reports.
Moreover, the Liberals criticized Sarbu's appointment to this position and announced that they would contest it at the CCR, as he has a file at the DNA, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position at the Court of Accounts does not allow him to make policy anymore.
The PSD Senator will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Accounts, remaining free after Ioan Anton was revoked, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is about to play a chef in "Burnt", the actor made a revelation his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: "I worked most of my life as a chef".
He revealed that he had worked in the kitchen since he was 15, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, to continue the same way.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so his entire childhood cooked with his Italian grandmother, says ContactMusic.
Asked what his future plans were at the time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make five-year plans, "not even two."
"It's not at all motivating for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you would laugh at if I told you," he also said, saying however that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, however, the actor admitted to seeing himself in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who started directing at this same age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto harshly condemned, Wednesday morning, Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta's claims that Hungarian political decision-makers are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational claims, offends the whole of Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a communiqué.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: he has totally lost his support in domestic politics in Romania," added the head of Hungarian diplomacy, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday night post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his view, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not wish to respond to the challenges arising from Hungarian government representatives.
"They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; and to anti-Semitic attitudes, and to the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!" Ponta said on Facebook.
The Romanian prime minister added that he is adept at rational and sustainable solutions in the case of refugee crisis, considering that brutalities and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values - what we see in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction precisely with these objectives and values!" the head of the Romanian executive stressed.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks on Hungary's handling of the refugee crisis as "simple lies", according to MTI, as inappropriate for a 21st century leader.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the "extremist and lying remarks" of the Romanian prime minister are related to the domestic political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against xenophobic speeches the idea of shutting down borders, that all who come are terrorists, are Middle Ages nonsense and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, we will get more, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like people, not how our Hungarian neighbours treat them, with bat and insert.
"I disagree with that," the head of the Romanian executive said in a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Also Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest has decided to start preparations in the field for extending the fence it builds at the border with Serbia to extend to Romania, in order to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Afterwards, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to erect a border fence would solve nothing from the refugee problem and "take Hungary out of Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Mecca crane?
Saudi authorities have announced that Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a crane, on Friday, on the Great Mosque in Mecca, which killed 107 people.
According to an investigation commission, the company did not "respect safety rules", the Saudi media agency (SPA) reported, reports the BBC.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed.
The firm will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction firm is owned by the family of former Al-Qaida terrorist network leader Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently run by the brother of former terrorist leader Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working on the expansion of the Grand Mosques for 4 years to accommodate more pilgrims.
The crash occurred on Friday night during a storm, when a crane, probably unbalanced by heavy wind gusts, crashed on the eastern side of the roof of the Great Mosque at Mecca.
Following the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut the contestants' mouths
Considered by many people the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his retirement from work, as a poor coach, who cannot be able to perform in the new position.
After unfortunate experiences at the national team, Steaua sau Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future of Constanta, the team he owns.
After exactly one year of taking over the team, the King demonstrated that he was able to turn a team struggling to save from relegation into a top one.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 draws and 11 losses.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, beating on European cups.
Things have taken an even better turn for the Future this season, as the team came second in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader of Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best League 1 attack, with 20 goals (on par with Astra), more than double the Star.
On the other hand, even though he brought to the team several experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and lately on the starting team appeared names such as Janis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The politics of the club made the Future a team to watch for teams from abroad, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Janis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with Steaua, the Future is the only profitable Liga 1 team, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh country of the EU.
Large countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the Romanian Centre for European Policy.
In an interview with Newspapers.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be turned into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come".
But there are masses that have started and we can't turn back history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as well as possible and adapt them to ourselves.
In Cristian Ghinea's opinion, we were at a very emotional time, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After he passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the situation now."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JHA council that actually hasn't solved anything?
It is clear that the EC president in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote on the council.
All the picks said he had the votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity applied in JHA and any state could block any decision.
Therefore, things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, was applied, and the board approved it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go forward.
Because it's a sensitive matter, there have been rejection reactions even in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy and they didn't want many countries to appear as an "EU" reaction to send us migrants on their heads.
They have therefore postponed, but the problem remains because obviously this wave is creating a huge problem for the Schengen governess and we will probably see big changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really removed, but the subject was just left to cool off?
Yes, on the other hand, there is talk of greater involvement of Frontex agency in the management of external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of members who are on the Schengen external border to the responsibility of community agencies.
Greece's border with Turkey is also Germany's border with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given limits to the old Schengen system.
Perhaps the Dublin principle will be waived, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state they first enter, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece caps, you can't call it Greece's business forever.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a precise mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, to share the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if it comes to them.
Because it remains a problem: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European states are going to pick up migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
It will probably come to unique filtering centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience in trying to integrate migrants, are countries without any experience, like Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
The fact is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are staying in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have left, winter is hard to get past the Mediterranean, but we expect an even bigger wave next year.
What do we do with these people?
My prognosis is that we'll get used to this problem, we won't look at it as catastrophic as media.
You were talking about countries with more or less experience.
Does it seem to you that there is any place where it has truly succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Magrebians in France, at the Turks in Germany, they're all enclaved.
I wouldn't go for radical statements.
Of course their integration is more difficult than other migration waves, but that doesn't mean they don't fit in at all.
It remains an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, in Germany, in Britain.
But purely police means won't work.
To create the fortress Europe is illusory.
The mechanisms for integration into European societies must be changed.
There's been some mistakes here.
We have to be more picky.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take over the values, not to remain with one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family including by marriages of convenience.
But the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
Just because others have failed in long-term integration doesn't mean we have to watch them drown in the Mediterranean.
Perhaps we doubt the quality of these people's values.
And if there's going to be an intervention in Syria, which I don't think, it doesn't mean that the country will recover overnight and you can take them back.
Until solutions emerge, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders closed, walls erected, border controls re-introduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project at risk?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so the pressure was too high on the countries where they set foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're free and clear, but everybody's got their own problems.
In front of a wave like this, it can't be like this, because some countries can't handle it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they're doing something, but in the long run, it doesn't change much.
After the bombings in France we don't have much more draconian anti-terrorism legislation in the EU than we did last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that sets in both ways.
And it's so unstable from week to week that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, a lot of war stories from politicians at home under the pressure of being virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public gets excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will go back to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real single European market.
And I do not believe that Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era that was not adapted to the situation now.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country, who thinks that if he pulls his cap on his eyes and plugs his ears, the theme goes away.
In the face of the reality of migratory waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or to say it's not your little country problem.
That's what we did, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated like the seventh country of the EU.
You're not, you're not playing big country.
Big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanian appetite for Schengen will decrease greatly.
President Iohannis says maybe it's a good thing we haven't already entered.
So we move from the despair of entry to a more pragmatic position, but the objective remains.
There is of course a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen for migrants to see us as the alternative route.
Which doesn't mean there's a reason why we shouldn't go into Schengen, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be unique rules of acceptance of migrants, unique rules of deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unique rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention to Syria in Ukraine no one else died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She thinks being great power is about messing with Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the Putin regime's military and financial effort, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
For a couple of years there was a struggle between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias, supported by Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia was able to complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates outbreaks of instability and chaos that it cannot shut down.
But you're only great power if you have solutions.
The game at the off-side is just a strategy to buy time.
Putin is probably waiting for offers to be made, to press the buttons to solve the situation.
Offers don't come because the world isn't convinced that he can solve one way or another the issues that he also created.
But I disagree with theories that say these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin more powerful than he is.
What button's coming up soon?
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now social networking representatives are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike" button.
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, informs the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg stated that the "Dislike" button would show a nuance of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the issue that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid when someone was posting on his account an important event in life, and someone else was going to give "Dislike".
Users of the network, which reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long called for the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said that it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the event of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving Like to that post," the Facebook representative pointed out.
The version of a new button on Facebook was not received well by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and social media," commented Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where the article was posted on the subject.
"I will give 'Dislike' to the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, an Atlanta microbiologist, claimed there was nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different views on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she says, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the Dislike button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary within 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands massed at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary declared a state of emergency during the day in two counties along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a main border crossing and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, recalls the DPA.
The measure drew a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Prior to the imposition of the new immigration legislation, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police announced on Monday.
Also, more than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" county council seat stands to fail.
Two builders in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to moving the institution, are falling apart because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The headquarters of the county council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will end up demolishing itself.
A year and a half after work on building consolidation and refunctioning had to be completed, the work did not even reach half.
A final stage in the epic of the building was consumed the other day, when the National Board of Appeals Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint by the firm that wanted to take over the contract to implement the technical project for the works still to be carried out.
The original project was drawn up by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the manufacturer went into insolvency and the works were discontinued, the negotiation procedures were started without the publication of a contract notice with Impex Romcatel, with the firm to update the technical project and then to organize a new tender for the works.
"The negotiations, however, did not complete through a contract, with the CJ assessing that the proposed form would be disadvantageous to the institution," Răzvan Timofciuc, represented public relations within the CJ, summed up.
The CJ's decision to discontinue direct negotiations was appealed in court by Impex Romcatel.
The JESAN Tribunal sent the complaint to the CNSC, which dismissed it, as late.
This does not mean, however, that the CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNCC decision to the Court of Appeals, only after a final sentence of it can consider finding another designer.
Thus, building consolidation work could be resumed at the earliest next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be appealed or not," Timofciuc said.
Work to consolidate the former headquarters of the Police Chesturi began in 2011.
A first works contract was terminated in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei had been carried out.
The tender was resumed, with the contract awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
The firm went into insolvency, however, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei had been made.
The work has so far been carried out at around 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, refunctionalization and attic of the building had been valued at 7.7 million lei.
"All right, I'll tell you everything!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against imprisonment with postponement.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, headed by former chief Narciza Nedelcu
An advisor from the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Iași accused of DNA in a corruption file recognized his fap tele.
The agreement on recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascalu was registered yesterday with the Iași Court, with judges agreeing to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dascalu was accused of false intellectual in continued form and agreed to execute two years of in prison with postponement, as well as community service.
As regards the facts imputed to Dascalu, the prosecutors stated that he, as an adviser to the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, "made falsely several minutes of acceptance, sell the contracts for the provision of services in keys previously by the O.C.P.I. Iași with the managers of SC Gauss SRL, SC Grup Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agency of Ca dastru and Topography SRL and PFA Lipșa Ștefan, who unreally testified that the contracted services were carried out in full, since they were not carried out and were not deposited with O.C.P.I. Iași".
The other day, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of OCPI were put on trial in this file, with the charges being the settlement of some services to the mentioned firms, although the work was not carried out.
Pre judicium exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the women's national handball for Olympic qualification costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday at a meeting with the press that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania's women's national handball team, "the main objective is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for this they have to pass two stages of caudine pitchforks, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," said Dedu.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
Staf which will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants assistant coach, doctor, two masseurs, goalkeeper coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get the qualification some things, specifically materials for physical training, that we've never heard of.
All to get to the Olympics, and I'll do everything I can to get them.
We're talking about a massive investment, it's a lot of money.
But this is the way to do performance.
Because right now we're in the Stone Age with preparation.
"The teams we're fighting with have these materials and they've had them for some time," said Dedu, who noted that they are trying to get the money needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility for our country to host a major handball competition.
We don't have a gym in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure issue and it is shameful to question a European gymnastics Championship.
Let us not forget that in other corners of the world Olympic neighborhoods were built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona there was a landfill, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the organisation of the 2012 Olympics was a success in terms of investment as well.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," said Dedu.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to give Romania a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gatu went civil with a project, people gave their consent in principle, but it became very clear very quickly that the hall would never be built.
I also had discussions with the EHF, told them we wanted to, that we were able to organize and they said that they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discuss concretely.
"So we have all the openness, and at EHF and at IHF, but we have no infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former great handball player avoided assessing the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all coaches to be booked in picks, that if they don't meet they turn against them."
Have a nice trip to the World Cup.
Romanian Rubbists debut on September 23rd, against France
The captain of the national rugby union team, Mihai Macovei, said in a press conference on Tuesday that all Romanian team members are ready for the matches at the World Cup in England, where he hopes to win two victories: "We are ready".
Both my colleagues and I are at full speed.
We trained to give our best performance in the four games.
Everyone will have high expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are heavy, and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But surely, if we win Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the crowning of so many years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania's national team selector Lynn Howells, at his first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me, it's an extraordinary experience.
For me it is very important that at every match I make Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraș, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in rugby in recent years.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made with the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the height of the event.
"These boys started playing in Romania's teams around 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who set out to realize a dream," said Dumitraș.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will compete in Group D, with the following matches scheduled: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition begins on Friday, at Twickenham Stadium in London, with the England - Fiji Group A match.
New Japanese culture courses organized at "Al.I. Cuza" University
About the arrangement of flowers in a vase, the ink painting, but also an easy study about the beautiful arts specific to the Sunrise Country you can learn at the courses organized by the Iași students.
The Japanese Culture Students Circle in Iasi organizes new Japanese culture courses (ikebana, sumia and fine arts) from October 2015 to June 2016, courses for both beginners and experienced people.
They will be held at the Centre for European Studies of the University "Al. I. Cuza" in Iasi and are organized in order to promote Japanese arts and culture, traditional and modern.
For these there is a single participation fee of 50 lei per month per person.
Apart from art lessons, participants will be able to take part in exhibitions and other cultural activities to promote beauty.
The Japanese culture courses I proposed were conceived as an invitation, addressed to the general public, to take the first steps on the road to self-knowledge through art.
"The interested people will be able to learn how to create harmonious floral sculptural creations (ikebana), how to capture the soul of the surrounding elements in plastic compositions using the Japanese art of ink painting (Sumie) or how to express their own individuality and creativity through the plurivalent universe of beautiful arts (graphic, drawing, painting)," said Sorin Mazilu, the teacher of these courses.
The courses are addressed to all those who are passionate about art, regardless of age or experience.
Registrations take place until September 30, and those who wish to ask for more information can do so at the phone number: 0742.027.153 or at the e-mail address: studenticultura@gmail.com.
14 million lei given to the "St. Spiridon" Hospital in Iasi at the budget correction
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received about 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health, following the budgetary adjustment.
The money the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in works to modernize and arrange some clinics, but also in medical equipment and technique for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomography computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgery, six beds of ICU properly equipped, eye microscope and other appliances necessary for medical conduct.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and construction works of the "Great Burn".
Out of the money from the budgetary adjustment, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to complete the modernization works in the main section.
"In addition, the following days we will do the reception of the works from the walkway connecting UPU to the clinics of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology to ensure the decent transport of the patient from UPU to the neighboring clinics," explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have in the courtyard and the Dermatology Clinic in Tatarasi, which it will organize outpatiently, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where the outpatient allergology, haematology and endocrinology are located and will have about 30 beds.
The coward, embarrassed by the RATP controllers and a flyer.
The Path of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife would ever set foot in your town again.
Unwittingly, they ran into the erroneous information in the leaflets, the dislike of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "that's what the law says".
The wives arrived in Iasi a few days ago, checked into a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist leaflets.
They also received a flyer in which RATP trails were listed.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited Iash.
But two days ago, in the Copou, they wanted to reach the Palas Mall.
Because there was no ticket truck in the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the leaflet: that they could take a ticket by SMS.
No one told them this service no longer exists.
Confident in the leaflet, they boarded a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the flyer.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers made an appearance.
They said there was no service for two years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
How am I supposed to know what was written in the local press, me coming the night before I visited the city?
I talked to the controllers, explained the situation, said they didn't care, it's none of their business.
The attitude was very defiant.
They said all they could do was give us one fine instead of two (me and wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my visiting day sitting at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" Ovidiu tells.
In conclusion, the family was fined due to erroneous information on the leaflet and controllers who "applied the law to blood".
It's not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about the money, it's not too much, but the point is, I felt cheated.
Bad luck for Vaslui rapists.
They had an accident and remained in remand
The trial of the seven rapists at Vaslui moved, since yesterday, to the Iași Court of Appeal.
The Iași magistrates tried the first court term in a non-public sitting in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old requested to be released.
Prior to the actual beginning of the court hearing, one of the Jishen judges to whom the case had been assigned, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The magistrate served until the summer of this year at Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Pe nale Section, he being the one who, on April 9, admitted a challenge made by four of the defendants, ordering their placing on house arrest.
Currently, the case is being tried by a panel of magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file he also formulated an abstention and Judge Dan An ton, on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubinage relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslui rapists would continue to remain in remand.
Ti nerii will remain incarcerated for at least another 30 days, when the county hunters will re-discuss the possibility of their release.
The next court term will be held at the Iași Court of Appeal on October 6.
Before arriving at the Iași Court of Appeals, the van with which the rapists were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident caused in the Pacurari neighborhood, the car entering Iași on the belt.
The Iveco car with which the seven rapists were being transported hit a Volks wagen car that had exited Canta Street, and the driver attempted to turn left.
The van runs from the end.
The car entered Iasi this way because the employees of the Administration of Prisons preferred the route from Vaslui to Iași on the Stables, then on the belt road.
They thus shortened the road by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the arrested called another transport, to take over the detainees.
Soon, a car was sent to the crash site from Iași Maximum Security Penitentiary, which took over the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
Following the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, guards surrounded the rear of the cars, and the arrested came out in gear, two by two.
"The incident has not been reported to the Police, because the drivers of the two cars have amicably agreed on the damages to be paid," said Chief Commissioner Mădalin Peasantu, of the IPJ.
Great migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clear and clear: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and should naturalize are, in itself, an insignificant but huge number compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, amounting to about 1500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Surely, if those migrants actually agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitic by underworlds and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the Gypsies is just a trivial example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, kindergartens or modern schools, provide decent healthcare, clean up dirt on the street, create honorable paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another fugitive country?
But what is particularly surprising is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is being dealt with.
We first encounter the bellicious hypocrisy of the strong EU states, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing their troubles with the smaller countries.
Then comes the cowardly hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, do not yet accept the other - of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably out of fear of someone stealing his national being.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although they invoke only the horrors of war as a reason for departure, accept no other destination of the exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Moreover, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analysed can only be mocked.
Causes must be eliminated, some argue and, relying strictly on the book of political correctness, demand peace and investment for migrants' countries of origin.
But in Romania there is peace and even some foreign capital enters from time to time in the national economy - but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has been revealed to us as an ankylosed, divided and overcome construction.
I deplored the fact that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but there is no future plan for the EU either.
And improvisation and threats don't help.
Then, what good is the EU, if the only advantage enjoyed by Romanians - the right to free movement - could be called into question because of the waves of refugees crossing borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migrant crisis, however.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, towards a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be ready for what comes next.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, practically imposed
The concession bid shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years in which it remained closed, the club in the courtyard of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concession for a duration of 10 years.
The construction has a useful area of 134 sq.m, on two hrube levels.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of literary cafe, bookstore or other cultural activities.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the tender being 6,830 euros annually, with a bidding pitch of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to operate the building continuously and continuously and cover all the costs of rehabilitation of the building in accordance with the technical design to be drawn up.
"The Club Podor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period during which the public catering unit operated in these spaces and after its evacuation no current repair and maintenance work was carried out as is commonly required during the operation of a building," is mentioned in the tender procedure documentation.
Offers to concession the club are expected until 18 September.

They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was being treated, and the drugs weren't hidden.
The children were rushed to Saint Mary's Hospital in Iasi.
They're stable, according to the doctors.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20, he received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in hospital in unclear conditions, in the black of the 1990s, when she had only two months of life, little, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family in Italy, in the same years that the adoption was loosely regulated, a young woman from Ireland, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again the other day in Iași with her biological parents from a village of the county, after almost two decades when no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will turn 20 these days, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to give their beloved daughter an amazing and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iași, to get to know her unclear past.
"The Newspaper of Iași", which witnessed efforts to search for the family of origin after some extremely vague clues, witnessed these encounters that basically break your heart.
The story of the reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are truly moving and overwhelming.
The story of Lily begins 20 years ago in the town of Ruginosa, when she was only two months old.
Then, because of a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home there began to be misunderstandings between parents, and the mother was forced to leave her home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me away.
He stopped the girl, and I haven't known anything since.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls grieving Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was admitted with her grandmother to the municipal hospital in Pascani, and also then the girl's father, Costica Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives would part forever.
They never found Crina at the hospital.
After internment, Lily's father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iași, and the father, when he returned, never found her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"He must have thought it was abandoned," tells a niece of the family.
Due to financial problems, Grandma was unable to come with Crina to Iași, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Because no one took an interest in the fate of the child during this time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection Iasi, who then gave her up for care to the Placing Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Centre she was found by Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love instantly with blondie Crina, and after some time she would permanently move with them to Italy.
Little girl had already done almost two years, while the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt like she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given him life," Salvadore, the adoptive father, smiles at us, as he grabs the girl's thin hand.
In the country, Lily's parents, Alina and Costica, continued searching separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Rustinoasa, but received no answer as to where his child might be.
The police then told her that she might be dead, but in Iasi the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I looked for her here, they told me in court she was away in Italy, in Palermo.
And the conditions to look for it were gone.
We prayed to God that he'd be all right.
I've been thinking about her for years, but there's been no possibility of us walking around, finding her.
"It's hard," tells us with tears in her eyes Lily's biological mother.
Even though the years passed, however, the parents of Ruginosa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past links her to Romania.
I was a little girl when I found out.
I guess I was five or six.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina says.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Chief Romics Commissioner Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Adviser Iași, was contacted by an acquaintance from Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of the Lily.
And the search only came from a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
I had just received a name, Balcan Costica, then the town, Ruginosa.
Soon I had an activity with the town hall there, and I could ask if there was a given name around the town.
Then they gave me a few directions, only the person they found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took about a month after that to find the girl's biological father," Chief Romics Commissioner Ichim explains.
In total, it took more than three months for the authorities to find Costica and Alina, especially since they were each domiciled in another locality.
We started our efforts somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we agreed that a first meeting would take place in September," Romică Ichim added.
In the past weekend, Alina and Costica first saw their lost girl in the halls of the hospital in Iasi, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, could barely contain his tears, and his hands trembled incessantly.
He barely talks to people around him.
A week before the meeting, he couldn't even sleep.
He was all excited, shaking.
"To see your child after so many years, it is something," says a niece, who also came with Costica from Ruginosa.
Meeting of the Lily with the biological mother and brother
In talks with his daughter, who is to study at a high-rated university in Italy, Costica Balcan told him, among other things, that if he once wanted to return to him, to the village, to come quietly: he can give him some sheep, goats, to find a boy from the village and raise a household.
My mom's excited too, she's crying, and she hardly thinks something like this can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I never thought anything like this could happen.
I've seen cases like this on TV, I've been thinking these years, I've been hoping, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're really great emotions.
If only he could forgive me.
I hope to visit you in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," tells us with great tears on Alina's cheeks, Lily's mother, while holding a napkin in her hand.
In him she hides her tears, from happiness, because soon she will see her face after so much bitter weather.
On the other side, Crina, who will be just a few days away, this month, 20 years old, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she sketched a vague idea of her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has so much to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are the ones who raised me after all.
It'll be a nice meeting, a great experience.
"I hope I have a nice memory of them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family meeting in Iasi
In Unirii Square, under the early autumn sky, the family of Ruginoasa again joins their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, following the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
They no longer divide their borders or their countries, but only a barrier: that of the tongue.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in central Iasi, they easily passed.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of its kind made, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises again, they will do it again.
It is the first event of its kind organized, by such an emotional charge, and I am glad to be a success.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, people addicted to drugs.
But we're trying to give societies something good back.
"If I will be requested for such an event again, I will do it with great love," says Romică Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advising Iasi.
Behind him, the Balcans, with Crina in the middle, drift away telling stories.
Understandably, they have a lot to say to each other.
Armistice at the PSD yesterday.
Everybody's pulling their breath
Camps in the PSD's Iişan branch ended a truce with the gun at his foot.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive chairman, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the Iași Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for the party's positions.
Far from ending, the internal war in the party seems to have taken just a break to allow combatants to catch their breath.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He has released a very simple and very current message under the conditions now: try to find a solution not to endanger the party.
On October 3rd we have an election in the party.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said the interim mayor, Mihai Chirica.
The two days of weekend talks only led to the conclusion that nothing definite had been established.
In the October elections, fierce competition is expected for President of the PSD county branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main position in the party's Iași branch are Secretary of State Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazar, County Councillor Vasile Catea and Acting President of the County Council, Victorel Lupu.
The mayor of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could also be added to them.
One variant considered is the candidacy of PSD county councillors leader Cristian Stanciu, in case Lupu will no longer enter the race, with sources within the party saying that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former branch leader, Mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
Under the statute, even on election day can applications be submitted, and would not surprise anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new County Permanent Office and all new management structures," said Catea.
Until internal elections are held, the management of the PSD's county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29th, with the preparation of the elections to be practically provided by the executive secretary of the branch, the county councillor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the talks in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached, in the sense of supporting a unitary team to deal with the county.
"But, on the other hand, there are several variants regarding the intentions related to the candidacy for the PSD presidency Iași, the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
A Jewish judge refused Vaslui's rapists file on the grounds of concubinage
The seven young men in Vaslui County convicted of rape arrive today at the Iași Court of Appeal.
Vasluians sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present today their arguments regarding their release, after the substantive court, Vaslui Court, established their imprisonment immediately after sentencing.
The file was registered with the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton filing a motion for abstention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants' lawyers, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the highest punishment in the file.
How Judges Motivated the Sentence
At the end of last week, the magistrate at Vaslui's Court who sentenced the seven young men motivated the sentence.
In motivation the judge speaks of the defiant reaction of the defendants, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of outrage among the public opinion.
"The court finds that after placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, restrictive measure of freedom but not custodial of freedom, under the impact of the defendants' attitude, their families and local supporters, a strong sense of outrage has been felt at the level of the local and national community about the fact that persons accused of serious crimes are judged under a less restrictive measure," Vaslui Court explained.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be "church door".
"The court emphasizes that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the defendants wanted to highlight by the defences they have formulated, as the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," the motivation further states.
Corbyn, Brexit and the Future of Europe
Because of economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades cannot continue the same in the years to come.
By Saturday probably few people knew in Romania who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he has become the new leader of the Labour Party in Britain, many wonder to what extent we can affect the election of a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of post-war Labour.
Marxist declared, anti-monarchist (he asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a fierce anti-American and sympathiser of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and get out of NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time viewed Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
According to the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like what Tsipras was saying and promising in Greece until he faced the real world and economic laws.
The economic programme of the new Labour leader provides, inter alia, for massive renationalisations and money printing as a solution for financing projects to develop and cover very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to printing money is not unanimously adopted around the globe, we would then have a general global prosperity!, but who would trip over such details.
Of course, we can tax bankers to blood, you become a sort of service enemies of the left, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Hollande's mandates.
Additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher well drew attention, "the problem with socialism is that at some point other people's money runs out."
Few give Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever become prime minister.
In the early 80s another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who was anyway not as extreme in convictions as the party's fresh leader, failed miserably in the election.
And then there was still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were sensitively more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant throughout the workforce, and extensive automations have caused a massive need for highly skilled labour in the industry, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
Even from opposition, however, it can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest Financial Times issue, Corbyn's choice increases the chances of Brexit and Britain's exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine these kinds of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the refugee crisis that is shaking the EU to the ground, you get an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide following the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the entire European project and the deep faults created within it by the Euro crisis and now that of refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
All the more so as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming the dominant actor anyway).
It is true, the British business environment, the City, are strong lawyers of the country's stay in the EU.
But today's Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are many resentments that are increasing in intensity these very weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we have even recently had a sample in Jean Clude Junker's speech, is increasingly tending to make major decisions over the head of the large majority of Member States by consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens as electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are also Eurosceptics increases spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the negative-loaded emotional climate has reached higher levels than ever in the past.
Hence the conclusion the Financial Times draws when assessing the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation based on national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe may be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we see a stronger integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the countries in the region and the periphery of interest and the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States fuels his populist rhetoric from frustrations accumulated in oocidental societies.
Because of economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have enjoyed over the last decades, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the coming years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-Immigration area, both caused by hasty decisions that have taken into account only integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and willingness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can significantly affect Romania's situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncuși, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancusi: "Take and sweep the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about him all over the world.
But behind his reputation lies something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered, recipes for success in life.
That something also has a name.
It's called toil.
What to write about Constantin Brâncuși?
What more is there to say?
His face appeared on the bills.
And recently, a well-known Romanian bank hired an actor to play it in an advertising video.
Brâncuşi produces and delivers money almost 60 years since he is no longer with us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
Moreover, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the baby, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to Brâncuși".
The country is littered with its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to the elderly.
Brâncuși's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Even the communists failed to remove it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes are encircling the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and share.
And then again, what else is there to say, to write about this man?
Looked at from the pile of books and articles that try to reconstruct his destiny, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that unless you were lucky enough to be born in some big city and in some rich family, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brâncuși's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe here would be a key.
Maybe that's where the following text should start.
With a sentence, however detestable they are.
Forget the stupid success stories that are delivered to you every day in newspapers and on TV.
Take a good look at this man's face.
You want to know how he managed in life, how, today, did he hear an entire world?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on 19 February 1876, in Hobita, a small village in Peștișani commune, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncuși leads a modest life, but one of which he would collect his landmarks that would guide his late artistic vision.
Remembering his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist would confess, in a meeting with Petre Țutea, from Paris, 1933: "Life was then beautiful and harmonious".
For millennia, people led, happily, a patriarchal life.
Everything passed peacefully from one season to the next.
And do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached up to us.
Brâncuși's childhood, however, was far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor his years spent in his native locality.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the baby was made "at the boiler", watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process was proceeding properly, Brâncuși catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with jam and drinks out of breath.
He falls in his sleep almost instantly.
The first people don't notice until a few minutes later.
My mother panics, then goes into hysteria, thinking her son is dead.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by fiddlers, he sees from a distance the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with their breath.
The party immediately turns to mourning.
The father is already thinking of burial.
However, one finds that it is good to call Baba Brândusha, a doctor and a servant of the Brâncus.
Brandusa checks the baby's breath, then puts horse dung under his nose, gathered around.
The baby sneezes heavily.
People applaud.
While the boy is allowed to sleep on his drinking, for joy, the party with fiddlers continues with even more force.
The next day, the father and son meet through the orchard.
Radu Brâncuși has Constantine gather some rods and bring them to him.
The father places his child upside down and, with the rods brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And as he feels the sting of the blows, little Brâncuși has the revelation that the world can also be viewed from another perspective and that things around him can appear overturned.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the one well known, makes him wonder, as he would admit in his old age, whether or not he himself was participating in his disorder.
Was the sun as troubled as his father by what had happened to him?.
At present, the city is not functioning
A MP appeals to politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjut called on PSD and PNL to stop internal fighting and refocus their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great disunity and that is all.
I didn't see anything from the USL projects in 2012 that went on.
Neither highway nor Regional Emergency Hospital, see only how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's put politics aside, get together and talk.
Currently, the city does not work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for those who chose you anymore," said Bald.
He appreciated that the current political class disappointed the Iași electorate, the consequence being a very low turnout in the upcoming local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of parties.
The deputy also believes that voters will also turn to traditional parties, expressing reservations about new political initiatives, such as the party "For Iași" which will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chance and will only break the electorate of the right, not the PSD.
Such parties rely on active civic people, who are usually right-wing.
"It is crumbling even more right, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," said Băjuţ.
He made it clear that he was not interested in a candidacy in the upcoming local elections, denying rumors of his intention to join the race for City Hall.
I also said I don't want to run for any local office.
I am still considering whether to continue as a Member in my next term.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iași and in the lobby discussions with the other MPs, and I was accused of wanting to get an image.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this.
"Just because people voted for us doesn't mean they're stupid enough to vote for us if they don't see anything," said Blăjuţ, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A colleague from Tatarasi said his money wasn't enough and he has to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
It's not small money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to pick up the money from the cashier.
At the end of my term, I will make a report on everything I have spent, apart from the salaries of cabinet employees and its maintenance.
I happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the shipping, accommodation and other accounts.
"To tell a MP that money is not enough for him is pure hypocrisy," Blăjuţ concluded.
