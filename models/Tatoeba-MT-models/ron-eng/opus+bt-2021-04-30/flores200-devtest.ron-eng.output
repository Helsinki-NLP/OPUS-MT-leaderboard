It not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered with feathers, an already widespread hypothesis, but provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brownish-brown at the top, with a light or orange color at the bottom.
The discovery also provides a perspective on how bird feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed spindle, called rahis, but feature other characteristic elements of feathers – beards and barbules – researchers have concluded that rahis was probably an evolutionary development arising after the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather to regulate temperature or impress. Researchers have suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not chicken puff.
Researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the puff of a chicken.

The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction to the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a kind of aura and is composed of a lot of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the presence of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African KwaZulu-Natal region.
"In an interview, he said the new variant is «very disturbing and worrying because of the very high mortality rate»."
Some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital, says Dr Moll, and at least 2 were hospital medical staff.

Candidates can send representatives to witness all stages of the trial. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, with clear procedures.

The first challenge he participated in was slalom, where on the first attempt he did not reach the finish. 36 of the 116 contestants achieved the same result in that race.
In the other competition he participated in, the giant slalom, finished tenth in the women's sitting group, with a total time of 4:41.30, with 2:11.60 minutes following the first arrival, Australian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes following the ninth-place competition, Gyöngyi Dani in Hungary.
Four skiers from the women's sitting event failed to complete their tour, and 45 of the total 117 skiers from the giant slalom failed to get a place in the contest.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
"Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, «We arrested five people who raped the Swiss and recovered her cell phone and laptop»."
The charges are called Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the charges appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit her, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the accident had been temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the Red TT Audi.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Later, he was transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She was detained pending impeachment and trial, but any ocular testimony could be altered, as her image was widely published.
This is a common practice in other areas of the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing photographs can be harmful.
"Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that «journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photographs and other information about suspects»."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, who is charged with prosecution, has told journalists that he will not comment again until at least the impeachment.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants drawn on the basis of pre-Middle East War 1967 borders.
Other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel claims that, after signing the agreement, it will have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the AP agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
Hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by rangers, with the test monitored and its effectiveness under assessment.
Under a partnership between the NPWS and the Australian Sports Hunters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited, based on the Sports Hunters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Park Conservation and Heritage Executive Director at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation benefited from comprehensive safety and training training.
Martelly took the oath yesterday before a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), consisting of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former CEP resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests, started in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some that should have taken place as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of iPod overheating that malfunction, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns in four people have been reported.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
"Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 incidents of overheating, which the company said were «not serious»."
"The Ministry responded, saying that the postponement on Apple's part is 'really regrettable'."
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Marianas' emergency management office said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Alert Center said there were no clues for a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostages from Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the state of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and the deaths of at least six have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and elders, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographs.
Later, photographs took the place of an elderly woman who needed the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
He pursued studies of obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the Auckland National Women's Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began in his spare time to research premature labor.
His research has shown that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua transmitted that government investigators recovered two "black box"-type flight recorders on Wednesday.
Brothers wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said that «The moon was the first Queen of the Extremes. My first manager. The moon died on the night of two months. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman.»
"Dustin Runnels, nicknamed «Golden Powder», commented that «The moon was as eccentric as me...perhaps even more...I love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place»."
Out of 1400 people questioned before the 2010 federal election, the number of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed, during the 2010 campaign for the federal election, that in his opinion Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign would end.
34% of those interviewed agree with this opinion, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the ends of the poll, 29% of those questioned believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medallist at the Olympics was to swim at the Commonwealth Games, in the 100 m and 200 m free trials, as well as in three relay challenges, but his physical condition was questioned due to his complaints.
He was unable to take the medication needed to control the pain, which was banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people verified the discovery before early February, using various combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the earth's water supply, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, as comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his government earlier this year and signed a bill last month, legalising same-sex marriage.
He referred to rumors as representing "political chatter and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA states would allow aircraft to travel shorter distances, thus saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, unlike older ground-based radar systems, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more accurate information to pilots.
No additional means of transport are available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking lots and public transport-related parking facilities are not available in the area.
Fears about the lack of means of transport have raised the possibility of organizing the party with closed doors, in the absence of supporters of the team.
A study published in Science magazine on Thursday reported on the development of a new bird species on the Galápagos Ecuadorian Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer, due to reproduction between Darwin endemic finches, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in a multitude of patterns. It can be rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into thin threads that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in sheet shape.
It can be made very thin and glued over another metal. It can be made so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "lit manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes colour depending on how acidic or basic (alkalin) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which electrons have been removed (given that hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
They mix the two powders together, and then, with clean and wet hands, they form a ball from them.
The humidity present on the hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewer system.
Residues from sewer systems were found in homes in the Minon cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used in common.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do that through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space, because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a huge rocket, 100 feet high, to take a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel gave us was to give us a much simpler and faster transport.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Underneath them we have several medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free pet cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche; each feline has its own role to perform, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similar to wolf packs or dogs, animals with behaviour surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
Complete athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, make long-distance jumps and fire a force five times that of a strong man.
Tigers fall into the same group (the genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the roaring with the full voice of a lion, but rather with a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents or birds. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than this.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) with the aid of smell, sniffing the land to find them.
Thanks to the night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move around undetected. The ocelots hunt their prey by cloaking themselves in the environment they are in, then throwing themselves at the prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) comes to be isolated from the main population from which it originates (e.g., if it moves over a mountain range or a river or if it moves to a new island, from where it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we won't be able to say they're the same species.
This process is called species, which means the formation of new species. Species is a consequence that cannot be avoided and is a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale (i.e. they kick out of the lungs).
Plants produce their food with the help of the sun, through photosynthesis.
We make our homes out of plants and we make our clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaur was the peak predator of its times, having no fear of anything but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional set in the palate, meaning that nothing that appeared in its path escaped safely.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a bifurcated tongue. Its food included turtles, large fish, other species of mossaurians, and it may even have been cannibal.
It also attacked anything that went into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could have coped with it.
While most of their kitchen would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails and a rodent called farting.
Another difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on the chair, wealthy men liked to make banquets where they lay on their side while eating.
The cuisine of ancient Rome could not include foods that arrived in Europe, America, or Asia in the later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient novel has ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was regarded as the home of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an internal sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were also built.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family was conducted outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the shops were just the counters that gave right into the street. Stone was used in the construction of the houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was slightly colonized. In the Scandinavian saga it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, he found Green Earth and named it Greenland.
But whatever discoveries he made, tribes of Eskimos were already living in those places at the time.
Although they were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences in the population, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you watched the film National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
"On the back of the declaration of independence can be read the words: «Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776». The text appears to be overturned, at the bottom of the document."
Although it is not known with certainty who wrote it, it is known however that, at its inception, the large parchment document (measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) had been kept running.
Therefore, the marking was probably simply made for labelling.
The D-Day landings and ensuing fighting cleared northern France, but the south was not yet free.
"It was ruled by the French «de la Vichy». These were French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working alongside the invaders instead of fighting against them."
"On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being referred to as Operation Dragoon."
Within just two weeks, American forces alongside the free French had liberated southern France and were headed for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a group of significantly large people living and working cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from Latin civilis, i.e. civil, being related to Latin civis, i.e. citizen, and to civitas, i.e. city or city-state; it also defines in some way the size of society.
State cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as actual civilizations.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – Congress being its only component – under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, because there was no executive or judicial authority at national level, relied on the often non-cooperative state authorities to implement its decisions.
It also did not have the authority to annul tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles imposed unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
Italy national football, along with the German national football team are second in the top of the most successful teams in the world and were the FIFA World Cup champions, in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 races.
Winter sports are most popular in northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
In Japan there are nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
"Because of the groups of islands Japan has, Japan is often said to be, geographically speaking, an 'archipelago.'"
The beginning of Taiwan took place long ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island, recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation into Aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty forces (1644 - 1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire, in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it cede sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, Temple of the Sun and Temple of the Three Windows.
Most buildings at the edge of the complex were rebuilt to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photo format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is also produced nowadays but, more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the formats of the digital camera image sensor.
The 35 mm format, somewhat confusing, is actually 36 mm in width by 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many regular formats (e.g. family of APS formats) are identical to or very close to this proportion.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing but a mere suggestion to create dynamism, while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place for positioning the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the frame into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, Christian religion has linked European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected them all, from the king to the common mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to ease suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been for over a thousand years in Rome, and this concentration of power and money caused many to ask themselves whether the principle was really respected.
Shortly after hostilities began, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, disrupting the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law provisions, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unbridled submarine war.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only 4 cents in his pocket, a poem book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous job boss) addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different periods of time; every stage of China or every family holding power represented a distinct dynasty.
Also, the periods between consecutive dynasties were marked by divided provinces. The range of this kind best known was the Three Kingdoms Period, over 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
During these periods there were fierce wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China's history, with thousands of people dying fighting to occupy the throne in the great palace at Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican one, the nationalist and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution men were able to acquiesce to all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because instead of the class-based armed hierarchy, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohamed was deeply interested in things that went beyond the mundane ones. He used to go often to meditate in a cave that came to be known as "Hira", on Mount "Noor" (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know its existence. Once inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
The only things that can be seen are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
"The Giza Plate, also called «Necropola Giza», in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the great pyramid is the tallest), several smaller graves, a series of temples and the great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
"The 'trace up' marking looks like a V, and the 'trace down' marking looks like a staple or square missing the bottom side."
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the frog (i.e. the part where you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An upward arch trait usually generates a gentler sound, whereas a downward trait is stronger and more determined.
Do not hesitate to sign your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for the bow features are there for musical reasons and normally must be observed.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Maria Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse of 11 years and Louis-Charles of four years) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They moved back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and howling threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave wide open the carriage windows.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles before the frightened queen's eyes.
The war expenses of United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippine state were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to bear much of the expenses and interest on bonds put on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street bank houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the templars, we need to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period during which events were held is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history encompassing the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an associated logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence and that technology, in turn, has 'effects' on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned."
For example, one might say that the car necessarily leads to road development.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the ownership costs of cars.
A large number of car owners lead to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, leading to the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily harm.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography have emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, have been better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is considered the capital of fashion in the contemporary world, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
His renown as a centre of luxury began to spread through 400 CE and lasted until around 1100 CE.
Its status was in decline during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silk and spices more prized than what the Byzantium markets offered.
This was the time when the title of Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak during the period between the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years ago.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important advances of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close clothing.
Living farming is agriculture made to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological system that uses preserved seeds, originating in the same organic region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were in subsistence farming and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures gather together individuals with similar thinking, who feel themselves moved away from the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
Features that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership by a distinct and symbolic use of the characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to inspire themselves in a few unfortunate cases of children who, following negligence, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
"Such children are called “untamed” or savage. Some wild children have been sequestered by people (usually by their own parents); in some cases, abandonment of the child was due to rejection by parents, due to severe intellectual or physical deficiencies."
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; and others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that nursed it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning should ease and make learning more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
The scaffolding or yard method is not a method of learning, but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Skeletons can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little pinman in Microsoft Office.
Virtual schemas are included in the software, having the role of interrogating, providing clues and explaining procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle by himself.
Children are placed in family care for numerous reasons, which range from negligence to abuse, even going as far as extortion.
There should be no children growing up in an environment where they are deprived of food, love and education, but they do exist.
We perceive the family care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe accommodation, caring carers, solid education and reliable health care.
Family care is supposed to cover the needs of children, who were not covered in the house they had previously been in.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
Distinguished features other than the Internet introduce additional dimensions in addressing the types of uses and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when investigating public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro expressions, facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that it can be seen if a person is lying by correctly interpreting facial microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage nevertheless manage to accurately assess sincerity.
He suggests, even, that such abilities to interpret human behavior can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of variations expressed.
Separation and recombination make each generation the direction of variation dominated by one or the other of the two genetic funds.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
In addition, failure to do so attracts serious consequences: slowdown of growth, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most easily accessible vegetable resources were leaf and legume proteins, but they are hard to digest for primates like us if they are not cooked.
Unlike these, feed of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides large amounts of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
"With all this in mind, it should not surprise us if our ancestors have solved the «protein problem» in a way similar to chimpanzees in modern-day savannahs."
Discontinuation of sleep is the procedure by which you wake up intentionally during the normal sleep period to resleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you into a conscious state without waking you fully.
If you happen to reset the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other options based on biorhythms involve drinking liquids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is its own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, to which, however, the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga have been added.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Yoga Kundalini, Kundalini energy (energency of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga posts, breathing exercises, mantras and views.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. By viewing different deities, energy channels are cleaned, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the US. With the end of the war, clashes of system, process and culture led to the distancing of the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and be fought seriously, by "delegated" armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans became useless almost overnight, however, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army were put in motion creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navy was to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have managed to occupy Britain, as it did with the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been tamed for the first time about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Crops and tribes of old began to keep them near the house to have easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing places, usually in the care of goats who were often children or teenagers, similar to well-known sheep. These shepherding methods are still used today.
Wagonway-type roads have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consist only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier charges than they could on slightly more irregular roads of the time.
The traverses were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, it was concluded that the rails would be more effective if they had a metal band on top.
This became a widespread practice, but iron led to faster wearout of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were produced entirely made of iron.
The first known means of transport was walking; people began to walk upright 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning the right man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
It meets bipedal specialization in fossils by Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years old, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus already went bipedal seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to some extent reduce future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don’t just want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed much as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are greater now because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press, a few blocks away.
"During the night, between 150 and 200 children were made, known as «Dunlap posters»."
On July 8, John Nixon made his first public reading of the document in Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 existing Dunlap posters are the oldest copies of the surviving document. The original manuscript no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs, because they have feathers and can fly.
But in birds you can still see many characteristics similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on the two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Basically, all computers used today are based on manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number may contain only one of the two values, respectively 0 or 1, and the name of these numbers is binary numerals or bits, in the lingo of computer science.
The symptoms, like vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication for an internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions on that particular poison.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originated in the old resemblance to bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both assassin beetles and bedbugs are nidicles, adapted to the life in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are almost 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which means that it is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a child is neither in their best interest nor in that of the child.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the event of adoption, natural parents waive their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works, using the scientific method. This method is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one, however, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible assumptions, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers mainly used classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas about all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself separated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not mere responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed mostly by living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important evidence in favor of the DNA hypothesis is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophagi, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They performed two experiments marking either bacteriophagus DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-like cells can be passed on to children, while mutations from any other part can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism organised around nature exploration attracts interested people to visit natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more information about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of small country settlements, to head for their jobs, passing by others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has dislocated the biosphere from one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost all complain about transport systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction about water quality or bridge collapse rarely occur in developed countries.
Why do transport systems give rise to such grievances, why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse happening?
The traffic flow studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult, as driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, the behavior of rulers tends to remain within reasonably constant limits; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
In order to better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main features: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to begin flying. The ability to fly allowed them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates for mating more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings in the back along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemerids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some felt he was right, but many believed otherwise; that is, the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, some six miles wide.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It accumulates the water of thousands of smaller waters.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and in the technical craftsmanship of construction.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which at the time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican Fortress is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican fortress uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican residents are Roman Catholics.
People have known since antiquity some fundamental chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since they can be found in nature in native condition and are quite easy to exploit using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, issued a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These were water, earth, air and fire.
It reminded rather of the four states of matter, (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he had theorized and transformed into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloys are actually combinations of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You will see that some alloys can also include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny, trillions could fit at the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing means emerged, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, without ever having to get their hands on a sharpener.
You can only wonder what the fate of the keyboard will be when something newer appears.
The fission bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart to the hill. Breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decompose with a small impulse or without impulse.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called bark.
The bark is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in higher relief areas.
There might be more tide in the nearest part, because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying the elements that attract people's attention or give them pleasure.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with development to maturity.
These theories study what causes some to want to do what they do and what in their environment may or may not cause certain things to do.
Two popular theories on content are Maslow's pyramid theory of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers start leading former colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty in making unpopular decisions, in conducting disciplinary actions, performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and empowering people.
On the other side of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals, who think they have to change everything the team has done and proceed in their own style.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the team's success or failure.
Often, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual members of the team often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group to which they belong.
They often have more autonomy than members of the conventional team, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Invisible Team" is the management team to which I report each of the members. The invisible team sets the standards for each of the members.
Why would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can manifest themselves freely.
As a result, the process by which an organization works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process to meet customers' needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to get organizations to achieve higher performance.
Data from neurobiology are physical evidence that underpins a theoretical approach to cognition investigation. As such, it allows narrowing the research area and defining it with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models, which helps us understand the processes that are taking place in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence to machines.
Research in AI involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and military, but a few software applications for personal computers and video games have also been used.
Field trips are an important part of any class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a coach trip is not possible.
Technology offers the solution with virtual trips. Students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while in class.
Virtual sharing of a field trip is also an excellent way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet school, in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, each year the site is remodeled, and previous versions are maintained online, to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve the student’s written expression. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the existence of an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
As students students often represent the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
"Also, blogging «forces students to be more aware of the surrounding world». The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to expand their study well beyond the usual school day.
"The proper use of blogs «can help students think more analytically and critically; responding actively to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of those written by others, as well as outline their own perspectives on certain issues» (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums featuring Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the undefiled natural beauty of Muskoka District and many more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian by excellence.
Larger portions to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that has the gift of surprising many: the number of African Americans living in the U.S. is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The eastern islands of Africa are in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and truest continent of its own when it comes to wild animals.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are famous as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea path from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say she is married, no matter what her real marital status is.
It's good to wear a wedding ring, but it doesn't seem expensive.
Women must bear in mind that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and is not out of the ordinary to be pursued, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Be determined when you refuse a man and are not afraid to stay firm in position (cultural differences or not, it still doesn't mean it's OK!).
The modern town of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BCE and was used as a strategic port by Phoenicians, Romans and Marines, being named Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it by calling it the Branca House, but abandoned it again in 1755, following an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the town as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish merchants who had established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tajins, ceramics, leather objects, hookahs and a lot of all kinds of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the eastern extreme, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement streets, especially the center area.
While Goma is a pretty safe place, an information effort is required for out-of-town visits to understand at what stage the battles that are still fought in the North Kivu Province are at.
The city is also the basis for the escalation of Nyiragongo volcano, also providing some of the cheapest voyages on the trail of mountain gorillas in Africa.
The usual price (local) of a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
"Along with its relative inaccessibility, «Timbuktu» came to be metaphorically used with the sense of exotic, remote places."
Nowadays, Timbuktu is an impoverished town, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites, due to the danger posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special show, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has a flair more Arabic than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in northeastern South Africa, bordered by the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodiles River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of national parks in this country (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are entry and daily conservation fees for the park.
It could also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry into either a number of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
The name of Hong Kong territory is given by Hong Kong Island and is the place many tourists regard as the central point.
The exhibition of buildings contributing to Hong Kong's horizon has been likened to a chart of shining bars that is valued by the presence of Victoria's harbor waters.
To enjoy the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the urbanly developed part of Hong Kong Island is cramped onto recovered land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that British colonizers have acquired and therefore for who is looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, this is a good place to begin.
Sundarbans is the largest coastline mangrove belt in the world, stretching for 80 km (50 miles), from the coast to inside Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is located in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not, however, just mangrove marshes - they also comprise some of the last redoubts of the vast jungle that once covered the plain of the Ganges.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about one-third is of lies covered by water/mow.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has become a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there would currently be 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, though most, especially those heading east and Jakar / Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 7:30.
Since buses connecting districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby goals such as Paro (150 No) or Punakha (200 No).
The bridge on the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to link the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With the two pillars rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and is two lanes 3.50 m wide.
The free crossing height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, was not open to circulation until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully functional in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
Guaraní represented the most important indigenous population group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region also housed other indigenous tribe groups, such as Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived hunting, picking and fishing.
"Paraguay, formerly called the 'Giantic Province of the Indies', was born in the 16th century, after Spanish conquistadors encountered its indigenous groups."
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has, with effort, retained much of its indigenous specificity and identity.
Argentina is renowned as having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official Falkland coin is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is set as the equivalent of 1 sterling pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley face to face with the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted all over the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on the outer islands, although they will likely receive British and American currency; early contact with the owners to find out what means of payment they accept.
It is almost impossible to change the pounds from Falkland outside the country, so you must change them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical area; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing point, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived frime more intense than the thermometer indicates.
"There are no particularly «rainy» or «dry» seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year."
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wild animals are however wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile it may seem, the bison, the moose, the bear and almost all other large animals can attack man.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven’t kept the right distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so it’s good to give them their space.
In addition, be careful that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so it would be advisable to avoid strong-smelling foods and keep clean in the campsite.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and was the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a naval confrontation of sad memory in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the murder of supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is between two ports. The most famous of these are located in three areas.
North Shore Beaches (in the North Harbour District), on the banks of the Pacific Ocean, extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where one can swim safely, and most get shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are in Waitemata Harbor, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide range of shops arranged along the shore. You can swim safely.
The main local beer is "Number One"; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
Many French wines can be found, but New Zealand or Australian wines would go better.
Local tap water is drinking, but if you have fears you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino comes full eye with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are peppered in price, but very good.
Many visit the reef throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near the beaches and near the river estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally, it can be found outside this period.
Sharks exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are scared of humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
The advance reservation gives the traveller peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often deal with certain hotels, but through a travel agent you can also make reservations for other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to get other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests must be addressed primarily to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp on site, and most participants consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to catch a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main scenes is over, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, take note of the location of the cabin, as navigation through the ice causes an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruisers in St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Cruisers are exempt from the obligation to obtain a visa (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent here by customers and the money they spend. There are usually no windows and clocks, and exits can hardly be found.
Usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the mood and guests to stay in the local.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, drunkenness affects judgment, and good players know how important it is to stay lucid.
Who will lead to high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On frozen and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like on dry asphalt.
During the blizzard, in a very short period, enough snow may fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or blizzard or condensation, or ice formation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari are probably Africa's main tourist attraction and the climax for many visitors.
The word safari, as commonly used, refers to land trips undertaken to see the amazing wildlife in Africa, especially those in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and standard equipment will allow for a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will be able to see them better using binoculars.
"A safari on foot (also called «a walk through the bushes», «safari road», or «on foot») consists of hiking, either a few hours or a few days."
Paralympic games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to have hosted two summer Olympics.
If you have booked plane tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may face a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but, at the end of March, cancellation policies for coronavirus reasons were not expanding until July 2020, when the Olympics had been scheduled.
Most tickets to events are expected to cost between 2500 and 130,000, with regular tickets costing around 7,000.
The ironing of wet clothes can help them dry off. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they do not exist in the room.
If you do not have an iron or if you do not like wearing ironed stockings, then you can try using a hairdryer if you have one on hand.
Be careful not to let the material heat too hard (which can cause contraction or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for one minute, in others more minutes are needed.
Filters differ between them as an efficiency level, and if you worry, consider buying water in closed bottles from a company with a good reputation.
Travellers may encounter pests they are not familiar with at their home.
Harmers can damage food, cause irritation or, in serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a man using physical force are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping gives you in certain places the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers to visit high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The portion of Point Marion and Fairmont features the most difficult traffic conditions across the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often crossing isolated and unplanned areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes and dangerous curves prevail.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those of the previous sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it is all the more important to be strictly respected.
However, quite bizarrely, the mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastry products are common, with apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, peanuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, taste what, depending on the region, are referred to as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
"A curry may be “dry” or “liquid” depending on the amount of liquid."
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands of which you can choose, Indonesian cuisine is a general term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without further qualifiers, however, the term tends to indicate food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of dishes spiced with simplicity, with the Javanese's predominant favorite tastes being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored spices.
The stairs support the rider's feet, hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider better stability, but they can pose safety problems, because it is possible that a rider's legs will remain stuck in them.
If a rider falls from the saddle, but remains with a leg hanging from the ladder, the horse can drag him when he runs. To minimize this risk, a series of precautions can be taken.
Above all, most riders wear heeled riding boots and a smooth and narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow ladder straps to come off the saddle if pulled back by a rider falling from the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - the most sought after place for climbing in Chile, known as Yosemite of South America, with a variety of granite high walls and peaks.
The ridges offer stunning views from the top of them. Climbers from all over the world continuously trace new routes through walls with unlimited potential.
Sports involving snow descent, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, which consist of sliding down the snow-covered terrain, using skis or a snowboard plate attached to your feet.
"Schiating is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called «ski booms» in English, which organizes whole vacations around skiing in a certain place."
The idea of skiing is extremely old – we have cave paintings that represent skiers since before 5000 BCE!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 Norwegians opened the first recreational skiing club in Australia.
Back backpacking on skis: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, shift skiing or skiing on skis.
It is a related activity, but which usually does not involve climbing or climbing ski tournaments, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrains and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover a little longer distances than walking – but very rarely you will be able to achieve typical speeds for background skiing without a heavy backpack in the back, on neat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean going through procedures for obtaining a visa and passport control again and again.
In this respect, the Schengen area is organised in a way as one country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to do it at passport checkpoints.
Similarly, anyone who has a Schengen visa must not obtain a visa for each of the Schengen countries individually, thereby saving time, money and documents to be obtained.
There is no universal definition that determines which items are antiquities. Some tax agencies consider antiques goods older than 100 years.
The definition varies depending on geographical location, where the age limit could be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than mass-produced similar objects.
Breeding reindeer is an important source of income among the sams, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other trades.
However, traditionally not all Sámi population members were involved in the widespread growth of reindeer, but lived on fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as livestock of burden.
Nowadays, many sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the sámi area.
"Although widely used, especially among non-Romas, the word 'Gypsy' is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population."
If the country you are about to visit is the subject of a passenger warning, it may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than yours, but their advice is intended for their citizens.
One example is how American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented superficially, generally and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Extreme weather conditions" is a generic term, used for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon, which has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of several kinds, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms, tornadoes, marine trombones and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal climatic phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to pay attention to the risks of severe weather affecting the area as it could mess up their travel plans.
It is indicated that anyone who plans to travel to a country that can be considered a war zone gets professional training.
An Internet search for "hostile environmental course" will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address much more in detail all the issues discussed here, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, much first aid and sometimes gun training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are quite numerous, but publications addressing war zones are scarce.
Travellers who plan to undergo a sex change operation in another country must ensure that they possess valid documents for the return trip.
Opening up governments to the possibility of issuing passports on which sex (X) is not declared or updated documents to correspond to the desired name and gender is variable.
The availability of foreign governments to accept these documents varies equally.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet performed surgery should not expect to go through scanners without affecting their privacy and dignity.
Return currents represent the flow of return to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often to a reef or similar formation.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and a rapid current to deep water can be formed there.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in an attempt to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move to a position where you are not caught again and, depending on your skills and whether or not someone has seen you, you may want to wait to be saved.
The shock of returning home manifests faster than the cultural shock (it persists less from the euphoria of the honeymoon), it has a longer duration and can be more severe.
Travellers who have easily adapted to new culture, sometimes encounter particular hardships in readapting to their native culture.
If you had returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost your habits in your native culture.
When you had just gone abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, being aware that visiting a new country requires an adaptation process.
The world does not always expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travelers returning home.
The show of sounds and lights organized at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
The noise made by tourists and sellers is usually heard constantly. The sound and lights show seems to come from a storybook.
The sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km to the north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural port.
The region in the southern peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula Mountains unite to give rise to this plateau, then split again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
On the north side, called the Sentinel chain, is the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4892 m.
In remote places with no phone reception, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone in general cannot hold the place of a cell phone, because you have to be outside, with an obstacle-free view of the satellite, in order to be able to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including recreational craft, as well as by expeditions requiring remote transmission of data and voice.
The local telephone service provider could give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly used alternative for people who plan a year off is to combine travel and study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending a university, but without jeopardizing their educational course.
In many cases, enrolling to one year of courses taken abroad may even increase your chances of entering higher education in your country of origin.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid when enrolling in these educational programs.
"Finland is a wonderful place for rowing. «The land of the thousand lakes» also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the coastal archipelagos."
In archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat per every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the figure is from 1 to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go ashore on trips on board a ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009)
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the above map, Berlin is by no means close to the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they fly for the first time or have experienced a traumatic experience.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from personal fears and dislikes of other things, which manifest to very many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can be helpful in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or the lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast deliveries. Often, delivery time is essential in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies own their own aircraft, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and customs.
The only way to get him through faster was to be sent as cargo. Airlines regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business is to pay a large wad of money for this privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do so for you).
It is not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate, and in the first class up to eleven times more!
In general, there is no point in looking for discounts for business or first class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and comfortable, in which context they charge tariffs as required.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffered from an interethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Moldova's dominant religion is Christian Orthodoxism.
İzmir is the third largest city of Turkey, with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern shopping center, located around an enormous bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centers, are equipped with 18th-century traditional red tile roofs, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe rather than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of nearby Eysturoy Island and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons above graves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking around this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became outside the borders of the country following an enthusiastic magazine crossing of its splendors, made by Lord Byron.
Scottburb bus 403 makes regular runs to Sintra, with stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also on the north side you can visit the Sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin of Fatima, a place known worldwide for St. Mary's appearances.
Please note that in principle you are visiting the site of a mass grave as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many men and many women alive who survived internment there, and much more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to the death there, both Jews and others.
You are asked to treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect they deserve. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not vandalize the place by drawing and making scratches on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most panels are made only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
Spanish, however, is widely used in public transport, along with other services.
Periodic subway announcements are only made in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be egocentric, rude and arrogant.
"Although it is often just a stereotype not in accordance with reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, as someone who is «bien élevé» (well-bred).
The reserved attitude of Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different types of soils and altitude levels.
The region also houses an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, laughter, wildcat and mountain cock can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts covering their knees and cover their shoulders as well.
Most monasteries provide cover for women who come unprepared, but if you bring yours, especially one in vivid colors, you will receive a smile from the monk or the mother at the entrance.
Similarly, men have to wear pants to cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from the ones available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. Unique size for men!
The kitchen in Majorca, like that in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summertime, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available spices such as cheese, tuna etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always start in capital letters, even inside the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somehow complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or an adjective being used in a nounized form.
Pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most of which are pronounced exactly as written
The letters you need to be more careful about are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowel after them.
Also, be careful to pronounce differently r and rr: diamonds means drag, whereas carro means chariot.
Persian language has a relatively light and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand the phrases.
Obviously, anyone who knows a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish can draw the premature conclusion that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete nowadays and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Since in their heyday light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, they are usually in cities or on campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas that have favorable weather conditions.
The gaze of cherry flowers, known as the Hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum flowers were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry flower parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the imperial court aristocracy.
Plants don't look better anywhere than in their natural environment, so don't give in to the temptation to reap even "only one" of them.
If you visit a formal landscaped garden, the collection of "species" will also lead to your expulsion, without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place, where you can easily orient yourself and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
"But being in the «upper tropics», just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to face both heat (always) and strong sun (when it's clear, rarer)."
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the place where according to tradition the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were interred with their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for organising a holiday.
For example, visiting castles on the Loire Valley, on the Rhine Valley or doing a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define the routes for popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important celebrations of Christianity and is celebrated as Jesus' birthday.
Many of the traditions relating to this celebration have been adopted by both unbelievers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, to see the sunrise.
For this tradition there are of course explanations in Christian theology, but it might very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often hold an Easter wake Saturday night in Great Week, with congregations often meeting at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the remoteness of the continent, mammals failed to undertake the journey, the result being that the giant turtle is the main animal grazing in the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctica during the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the boreal aurora, because the sky will be, more or less, dark at that hour.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not, therefore, often a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
The Japanese culture of labor has a more strongly hierarchized and formalized character than that with which Westerners are accustomed.
Costumes represent standard clothing in the business environment, and workmates address each other using the surname or title of the post.
Harmony at work is an essential element, with emphasis on group effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often need to obtain the approval of the superiors for all decisions they make and expect them to follow the instructions of the superiors without discussion.
