Former head of Brazilian presidential cabinet brought before court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted charges against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for his alleged involvement in a massive corruption scheme concerning the state oil company Petrobras.
The federal prosecutor's office said Jose Dirceu would be sued for corruption, scam and money laundering charges brought this month.
Fourteen other people will be tried, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former treasurer of the Workers' Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, the former president of Petrobras's business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the ruling Workers' Party taken into custody for ties to the scheme.
Dirceu served as the cabinet chief of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested in early August at home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year sentence for involvement in a vote-buying scheme in Congress over 10 years ago.
Prosecutors said Dirceu developed the bribe-taking scheme at Petrobras, accepted bribes while in office and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after being jailed at the end of 2013 for the vote-buying scandal.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved about $2 billion in bribery and other illegal funds.
Some of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also have included bribes to Petrobras executives in exchange for inflated contracts.
"Miracle" recovery of a surviving student of the Peshawar massacre
A paralyzed teenager after being shot four times in Pakistan's worst terrorist attack managed a "miraculous" recovery after undergoing treatment in the United Kingdom.
13-year-old Mohamed Ibrahim Khan, the doctors in Pakistan had told him that he would never be able to walk again.
At least 140 people, mostly children, were killed when armed men attacked the army's public school in Peshawar last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will later be discharged from the hospital.
Exactly nine months ago, on a regular Tuesday morning, Mohamed was sitting in first aid class and listening carefully to his teachers.
Just then, seven armed men disguised as security guards' uniforms were entering the army's public school.
They wore explosive belts and had a simple mission to accomplish: to kill all the men, women and children who came their way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," Mohamed says with a harsh look.
I was sitting in the auditorium, asking questions... then I heard gunshots outside.
The terrorists went inside and started killing. Our teacher was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he removed four students from the amphitheater while the carnage was unfolding.
Then he says he heard his friend, Hamza, calling out to him.
He said, "oh, brother, save me."
I held his hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he was shot in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohamed's arms.
Mohamed recalls that right after that he fainted and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the waist down.
The doctors in Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then those in Rawalpindi, close to the capital, told his family that there was no treatment and that he would never be able to walk again.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul come out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son so fond of cricket would never be able to use his legs again.
They campaigned and sought help from Pakistani television, attracting the support of famous people such as Imran Khan, a cricketer turned politician.
Eventually, they were able to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and give him treatment at the private Harley Street clinic in London.
Consultant neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Mohamed as "frightened" when he arrived at the hospital.
"He had spent the last [a few] months lying in bed, unable to move from side to side, Malik says.
He was weak, there was a lot of pressure on his back.
He wasn't in very good shape.
A vertebrae at the base of Mohamed's spine had been destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in the shoulder, hip and back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
But during a six-hour operation, Malik and his team were able to retrace the nerve endings and rebuild the damaged part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Exactly a week after the surgery, Mohamed stood up and began to take steps and walk.
We didn't expect such a good result.
It was a miracle," he says.
Within two weeks of the operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and begin the long recovery process.
Mohamed defied fate and began to walk again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But he is determined to return to Pakistan, join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel like I still have a chance at life," he says, showing pictures of weapons drawn by him next to school textbooks and pens
Physically, Mohamed is getting stronger every day, but the psychological trauma he's going through and now it's unimaginable.
"My anger has not waned," he confesses.
Little children were killed in my school.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes out a tear, caresses the head and says, "I see my son walking again".
He will be able to go on with his life naturally.
Three's 4G "Super Voice" service provides better signal
Three uses a lower frequency 4G spectrum that can cover a wider area
Mobile provider Three has launched a service in the United Kingdom that it says will improve reception within buildings and rural areas without signal.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a lower frequency spectrum.
Other networks also plan to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (Volte)".
This currently only works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three mentions that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to the service by 2017.
Chief Technology Officer Bryn Jones said, "By the end of the year, a million of our customers will have access to better coverage indoors and they will be able to use their phones in more places than before".
The stars are preparing for the pantomime season
The pantomime resort is very important for theatres throughout the United Kingdom, many of which are now preparing for this year's season.
Now, some of the biggest names in showbusiness are participating in the Christmas theater.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in Cinderella - the first in the role of one of the evil sisters, and the second in the role of the fairy.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I do nothing, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson has recently been named the big winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson has often been named as the most hardworking musician in the progressive rock world.
The talented musician won three awards at the Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for Best Album of the Year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "an intelligent, expressive and captivating work of art".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of several musical projects, the best known of which is the rock band Porcupine Tree.
Now, before two closed-house shows at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson releases a double LP in vinyl format only, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo work.
He told to the BBC about his love of vinyls and his busy schedule and explained how comedy actor Matt Berry got to open his performances.
What's vinyl to you?
I grew up in the very end of the vinyl era, and I remember that I couldn't wait for the CD to come out, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You'd buy a record, go home with him, have a scratch on him, and you'd have to bring him back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, like classical music, they're better than vinyl.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there is nothing left that you really value.
Having a vinyl is like having a beautiful painting hanging in your living room.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you get absorbed in the lyrics and overwhelmed by the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it can't be if some kids too young to remember vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any vinyl you particularly care about?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyls in the '90s.
All the vinyls I have are bought again.
I started from the idea of redoing the collection I had when I was 15, but I crossed that line.
The first record I convinced my parents to buy me was Out of the Blue at the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original copy, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately, it is somewhere in a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a gateway to possible new fans
Why did you release your new Transience vinyl compilation?
This was originally conceived as an idea for record store day, but we missed the opportunity.
My label had suggested that I collect some of my shorter and more accessible songs.
I came to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing something like "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I absolutely wanted the project to be released on vinyl only.
Whoever buys vinyl also receives a downloaded variant at high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in its true light?
No, because, although I focus on longer music pieces, there is one thing that I have always cherished above everything: the melodic side.
There is much progressive rock that focuses on technical complexity rather than the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the test of time due to the fact that they always emphasized the melodic side and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for the Albert Hall shows?
I don't want to reveal too much.
The repertoire will be completely different every one of the nights.
In the first, there will be a version of the show Hand. Erase. which we had this year, but on steroids, with a few guests.
The second night is going to be more of an incursion into my history, this being more oriented towards the fans who have been following me over the years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show on the second night?
And me and the others on the tour team are big fans of [the Channel 4 comedy series] Toast of London, to the point where we always give quotes from it.
I thought I'd listen to Matt's music, too, so I bought him the album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our mutual love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
It seems to me I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You remixed albums by bands like XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does that affect your own music?
I do not consciously inspire myself from this, but inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they remain in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was undoubtedly the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that we had remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all of the previous year.
The current album, Hand. Erase., is much more open, because I had worked at Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the busiest progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can eliminate the progressive word.
I think I'm probably one of the most labor-obsessed people in the music world today, and I'm not saying this proudly, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has an incredibly strong work ethic.
If I don't do anything for a whole day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why working on remixes was a gift, because it means I don't always have to do just my music.
The music industry is a tough place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend that to anyone as a profession.
I work daily and am not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy, I don't think I would have survived.
Transience will be released in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will perform at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his 2015-2016 European tour.
A new contract brings jobs back to Skytrans
The new Skytrans rehired part of the airline staff who had lost their job when the old Skytrans went bankrupt.
Skytrans, the remade company in northern Queensland, awarded a $25 million contract to carry employees of the natural gas company QGC, which meant 18 crew members regained their job.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January, after the Newman government rewarded the subsidised routes that formed much of the airline's business.
Bankruptcy caused several communities to face potential isolation, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal federal MP for Northern Queensland, was the representative voice of criticism by the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thinee, executive director of Skytrans, said the airline's contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We were able to rehire 18 full-time Skytrans staff members, as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff with direct logistical experience in managing flight operations for QGC customers.
In just five months, we have increased by 100% the workforce, with 78 staff members employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to have Skytrans expand its flight operations from its headquarters in Cairns, which serves Cape York and Torres Strait, and also include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights a week for QGC personnel and Brisbane entrepreneurs to locations in Chinchilla and Taroom, in its 36-seat Dash-8 aircraft, starting on Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, managing director of QGC, said Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
"We are delighted that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal MP and new mom Kelly O'Dwyer gets the advice to make a larger dairy reserve to avoid missing votes in the House
Looks like more women will be in the cabinet.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be sworn in on Monday and there are strong signals that more women will occupy portfolios.
One of the government's rising stars, Kelly O'Dwyer, received advice to make a larger supply of milk for her newborn to avoid breast-feeding interfering in her duties in Parliament.
The advice comes from the government's discipline officer, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his Labour counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a breastfeeding MP, according to the ordinances in force.
Liberal MP Kelly O'Dwyer with her daughter, Olivia.
Under the current ordinances - the set of rules governing the conduct of MPs in the House - nursing mothers get a voting power in Parliament.
That means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the House.
But Whip did not know of this exoneration until he had consulted the Opposition Discipline Officer, Chris Hayes, on the matter.
Things precipitated on two occasions, when O'Dwyer could not attend a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to make a speech because he had just begun breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the MP had considered making a larger milk supply instead of breastfeeding.
Scott Buchholz, MP of Queensland, is the government's discipline officer.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources from Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the Higgins division representative was furious when she was told to make a larger milk supply instead of breast-feeding her daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This is revealed just as new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on his new cabinet.
Buchholz, a Liberal National MP of Queensland, was promoted to the position of Disciplinary Officer by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of this year's February no-confidence motion attempt.
O'Dwyer, in the picture alongside Amanda Rishworth of the Labour Party and her son, Percy, is one of three mothers in Parliament.
Formerly in charge of discipline, Phillip Ruddock, was removed just days after Abbott had faced a no-confidence motion seeking his removal from office, and was replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, Liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed in charge of deputy discipline.
Nickolic had recently kept the headlines, after it had been discovered that he had sent Turnbull a message asking him to quit challenging Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after the birth of her daughter, Olivia, in May.
It is one of the three parliamentary ones that became mothers this year.
Labour party spokeswoman Catherine King said on Wednesday that the voting power for nursing mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven]," she wrote on Twitter.
The discipline officer should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted to the cabinet late last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday he wants more women in his cabinet.
"No one wants more women in positions of power, influence, in Parliament, in ministries, across the country than I do," the prime minister told reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included only one woman in his first cabinet and, after sustained pressure to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman to the cabinet, after the December reshuffle.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will the markets react?
Mal Maiden, an editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull could have on Australia's business sector.
On Tuesday, lobbying groups in the business sector did not know how to express their enthusiasm more strongly when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's reins as Prime Minister.
The main reason is that much of what many of them would have wanted to see had been abandoned under Tony Abbott.
Or he had simply reached a negotiated suspension because of Abbott's "crash-or-crash-through" political style.
Representatives of interest groups spoke in unison about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy the public interest, reach political agreement and make things right.
So what exactly are the country's largest companies and their representatives waiting for by our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity.
Turnbull itself set the free trade agreement with China as a starting goal.
In his first speech announcing in the media that challenge, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (Chafta) was the focus of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In an August speech, Turnbull criticized "the revolting outbursts of economic chauvinism" from the Labour Party on that issue and expressed concern over the racist tinge of critics.
"In the context of the ChAFTA, the winners are, numerically, much more than the losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes that he will win this debate.
Don Argus, legendary representative of the business environment, stressed that this is an essential point, being supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the 100 largest companies in the country) and James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and this will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to overcome negative publicity and negotiate with the entire senate.
Small Business Minister Bruce Billson supports the recommendations in the Harper Analysis.
This could lead from the outset to certain divergences with the business environment.
The impact assessment applies to large mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer from a lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the company's shares and intentions, but also the effect they will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this assessment is drawn up is extremely important for the result.
Harper's analysis of competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it more difficult for large corporations to drive smaller operators out of the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was on the side of the Australian Business Council and major retailers.
Turnbull now hints that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he will do next.
The CAA jumped as burned to state that if Turnbull followed Harper's analysis recommendations, consumers would have to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one that advised the new Prime Minister to have greater respect for the trials in the cabinet, which Turnbull seems to be doing to himself by letting Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Enterprises (who is on the side of Harper recommendations) support his arguments before his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers pursued women between the ages of sixty-eighty.
Those that mainly eat plants, fish and olive oil have "significantly" reduced their probability of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication board into question
Terrence Howard thinks I completely misunderstood arithmetic.
The villain in Empire told Rolling Stone magazine that he did not believe that one times one is equal to one.
"How can it be equal to one?" he said.
If one times one makes one, it means two has no value, since one times itself has no effect.
One times one is two, because the square root of four is two -- so what is the square root of two?
There should be one, but we're told it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's teachers disagreed with his theory, so he dropped out of the Pratt Institute, where he was studying chemical engineering.
"I mean you can't close your eyes when inside you know something's wrong," he explained.
Howard found for his parallel approach to mathematics the name "Terryology".
The actor confesses to spending his time cutting and reassembling scissors, wire, magnets and plastic sheets to illustrate his "one-times-one" theory and other similar theories of his.
He told the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, were spending up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
The publisher of Rolling Stone described Howard's creations as "bricks with infinitely more complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional forms, tied together with copper wire or trapped with magnets".
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the US patent 20150079872 A1 ("Systems and Methods for Improved Building Brick Applications").
Also, the actor in "In the footsteps of an idol" also says that Pythagoras Einstein and Tesla would "go crazy" if they saw Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've wondered since I was three to four years old why a bubble takes round shape?"
Why doesn't it become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard also added that he hopes to change the entire course of education.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that one times one makes one," he said.
They will no longer have to grow up in ignorance.
In twenty years from now, they will know that one times one is two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
True universal mathematics.
We'll check it out in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
Tuesday, during "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star performed little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, performing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with Aguilera's voice.
Fallon in turn did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also performed, one at a time, versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weeknd.
This week, Grande's name kept coming up in the press.
The same day he had also been on "Good Morning America", where he opened the show with the doughnut lick incident.
Taco Bell hopes that the "Cantina" restaurants where wine will be served will become points of urban interest
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in the city?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22, the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain will open a new location in the Wicker Park area of Chicago, offering a tapas-type menu of appetizers, a fresco painted by a local artist and even alcoholic beverages.
It is the first test location of the chain's "Taco Bell Cantina" restaurants, which address young people, concentrated in increasing numbers in city centres.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6000 restaurants in the US, has its roots mainly in the suburbs and is associated with cheap, fast prepared food such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average USD 7 Taco Bell bill, the company used drive-through service and quick services to attract the number of customers needed to make profit.
But Taco Bell states that in order to address the new generation that "seeks more central urban environments in which to live, work and have fun", test locations must follow a different pattern, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
So you can do a drive-through, you need land.
Can you imagine buying an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"You can't afford it," told USA TODAY Neil Borkan, the Taco Bell franchisee who will operate the Chicago location.
At the Chicago location, the new menu will be prepared alongside traditional Taco Bell offerings, in an open kitchen, where "you will be able to literally see the food" before it is ready, said to the Associated Press Meredith Sandland, head of development at Taco Bell.
Wine, beer and frozen alcoholic beverages will also be served at the new location, following the recent example of many of Taco Bell's competitors.
Now seventy-five Starbucks cafes offer "evening" menus that include beer, wine and snacks.
A thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic beverages.
The company asserted that another Taco Bell Cantina location would open in San Francisco near AT&T Park this month, replacing drive-through service and parking with an indoor yard and a sales window.
These changes in location, atmosphere and annexes indicate that the fast food restaurant chain wants to attract other types of customers besides those looking for fast food late at night.
Taco Bell first decided on a higher quality culinary line in 2012, when he inaugurated more expensive Cantina and burrito menus, to compete with Chipotle, with the project supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If successful, Cantina restaurants will represent another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said that by 2022, he planned to open 2000 restaurants in the US.
As Sandland told AP, "a few hundred" of these will be of the "Cantina" type.
Hot phones in the middle of the night: Elton John woos Putin
Russian President Vladimir Putin telephoned Elton John on Monday night, just days after the British artist publicly stated that he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss antigay legislation in Russia together.
The declared gay British singer tried unsuccessfully to get a meeting with Putin while in Russia in November 2014, a year after he defied the protests in this country and held two concerts in 2013, during a hectic period in the history of this state, after the adoption of controversial laws banning "gay propaganda" among minors.
In 2014, in St. Petersburg, the British artist criticized these laws and made the following statement in front of fans: "Although I am gay, I have always felt welcome here in Russia."
If I wasn't honest about who I am, I wouldn't be able to write these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express life.
If we start punishing people for something like this, then the world will lose its humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist revealed that he wants to meet with Putin to discuss the controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information regarding the telephone conversation between the two personalities.
Rooster also "singed" in the ANRP file
Businessman Dorin Cocos tries to save himself from a stinging conviction, "singing" also in front of the judges and detailing how he shared millions of euros to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Hearing yesterday at the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the file in which he is tried with his son Alin Cocos, by the former head of DIICOT Alina Bica and by former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of Compensations within ANRP, Dorin Cocos was struck by the lightning of honesty.
He admitted all the charges and told the judges in detail how he helped businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of compensations at ANRP, instead demanding that he be tried faster and that his collaboration be taken into account.
Thus, Cocos showed that he knew Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that he became friends with him after several real estate businesses.
He said he met Sergiu Diacomatu in 2010, and he told him he worked at ANRP.
We later learned that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised him money, 2.5 million euros, money that I told him I would give him in several instalments.
I also promised him political support to stay in office.
"Diacomatu told me then that he was helping me, but that he needed support," Dorin Cocos showed in the courtroom.
He also said that, later, through an acquaintance, he came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then the head of the Central Compensation Commission, to whom he promised 800,000 euros.
For George Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted to get over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, we also gave him five million euros.
To the Lilie Dumitrean one million euros, to Dragos Bogdan I gave 800,000 euros.
I'm stating that all this money was in the trenches, to make sure that the file was resolved.
"That's all I told them: to solve the file, to make compensation," said Cocos.
Asked why he came to do these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I received, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I was left with only 1.2 million euros.
In 2013 I also met Alina Bica.
"I've never talked to this money or land," Cocos showed.
He also showed that "it was notorious that at ANRP all the members got along before the meeting".
I wasn't nervous they wouldn't vote positive.
All positions were political in ANRP, but I personally did not help Diacomatu politically.
"I told him I was helping him politically just to reassure him," Cocos concluded his statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to the DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at the DNA yesterday for only five minutes, during which time he filed new documents in the file "Turkish - Rovinari".
Victor Ponta ran to the DNA with a European Court of Justice document
Convinced that the prosecutor of the case will receive him for a discussion on the file in which he is investigated for forgery in documents under private signature, complicity in tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to the DNA, although the documents he had could be sent through the lawyer.
It wasn't meant to be, since the prosecutor didn't have time, the prime minister leaving after five minutes, during which time he left several documents at the registrar's office.
I wanted to file (on file, n.r.) the decision of the European Court of Justice of 3 September, which explains what happens to service contracts.
I say we did some work, the D.A. says we didn't, the European Court of Justice told us to mind our own business, because as long as the taxes were paid, it's fine.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, sure, for all countries of the European Union, we do not have a case here," said Prime Minister Victor Ponta, at the exit from the DNA.
Ponta also said that, from his point of view, the decision of the European Court should apply, if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court and call him back to the hearings, but to give him an answer to his requests, including the disentanglement of the file.
Iohannis enjoys his warrant without a TV
In Romania nowadays, there is no legal provision that forces you to watch TV.
And you don't even own a machine like that, since you pay your TV fee with your energy bill.
But if you're head of state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that in the job description of the President of Romania it is also registered when connecting to everyday realities.
President Iohannis immerses himself daily in total silence in his office at Cotroceni
Only, to the stupor of even his closest people at Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Iohannis refuses to have television in the presidential office.
And after that he wasn't watching TV -- no programs, not even German stations RTL or Pro Sieben -- the president wouldn't listen to the radio stations or read the newspapers.
In addition, it does not even receive the "negative monitoring" that, for example, its predecessor demanded as a priority.
Instead, Iohannis is happy to receive only the report with the news that puts him in a positive light.
Besides this informational self-isolation, in which the only breach is the facebook access, much more serious is the blockage to which, through his passivity, the head of state pushes the entire activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that's because, although it's been so long since his installation in office, Iohannis has not yet signed the loyalty statements of more than half of the Presidential Administration's employees.
Which is becoming an increasingly serious problem, both human and legal.
Peace and quiet
It is already clear to those in the presidential entourage that no one and nothing can break the "feng shui" in the chief of state's office.
Where there is peace and quiet.
What is right, only after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when the former Aedil of Sibiu demands the presence of the officials.
A habit he probably hasn't gotten rid of since he ran the town hall on Cibin.
And about the fact that Iohannis doesn't want TV in the office, many legends have already been born, there are already people from Cotroceni Palace who have come to lean towards the possibility that the president would thus try to avoid his monitoring.
Especially since he doesn't have a radio.
Only, at this rate, you are going to meditate soon in the dark, because lighting devices can also hide the audio-video recording technique.
Just for the best
Also, another strangeness at Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of state only of the "pzoitive monitoring" of the president's activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Iohannis or his wife, the head of state will receive on the bioru its content.
If you don't, don't!
Even more interesting is that it was banned from "negative monitoring" given that, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a result of the nightly television shows in which he was criticized, but he demanded every morning, with priority, the negative news.
That doesn't mean it must have helped him, but, that saying, the gesture matters!
And at least you can never have the excuse that he wasn't well informed from alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed.
Now, finally clear up the mystery of why Klaus Iohannis doesn't want to watch TV.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, no matter what formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the Presidential Administration.
Who, in order to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of state in office and who must also bear his signature.
Only, since December until now, Klaus Iohannis has not signed for confirmation even half of these statements, although this was supposed to happen within 30 days at the most.
So hundreds of employees, representing more than half of the Cotroceni Palace staff have an uncertain situation now.
Because legally speaking, if the head of state doesn't personally sign their statement, they should be dismissed.
Except all of them didn't get a negative opinion!
So, I mean, the Court of Auditors inspectors can always come, who will find that for over half a year, so many hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the edge of the law.
Until the president decides whether to fire them or confirm them on their posts, the decision is strictly his own.
Authorities said a teenager was plotting an attack against Pope Francis during his visit to the U.S.
A teenager's ISIS-inspired plan to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the US was "aspirational" rather than operational, a police source confirmed for Fox News on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August, when law enforcement authorities foiled the plan.
The plan is the same one Texas Representative Mike McCaul, the president of Homeland Security, referred to during an interview Sunday, said a source for Fox News.
"We are monitoring very closely the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul said at ABC's "This Week".
Pope Francis was not mentioned as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
of joint information by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security on August 14, in which it was stated that the teenager was planning to use several attackers, firearms and explosives, targeting "a foreign dignitary during a high-level event".
The bulletin mentions that the minor radicalized through social networks.
The teenager may suffer from a mental illness, a source of law enforcement authority told Fox News, but without giving accurate details about the young man's illness.
Also Sunday, McCaul recognized the potential for an attack from a so-called "lone wolf" across the nation and noted that he was informed by the Secret Service of a "strictly secret location" for the Pope's visit.
And with that comes a great security risk...But as the date approaches, I think we will all be very vigilant and protect it when it reaches the United States.

The skeleton dating back to the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, experts say
Irish archaeologists have revealed astonishing details of the strange skeleton dating back to the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
The beech of Colloney, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, bringing out the gruesome sight of a skeleton trapped between its roots.
The Irish Service of National Monuments brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyze the remains, thus discovering a gruesome story.
"He was violently killed," Marion Dowd, director of Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, told FoxNews.com.
In the upper chest he has knife wounds. He has another such mark in his left hand, which suggests he was trying to defend himself.
The skeleton belongs to a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that the remains are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We cannot know if he was killed in battle or in a personal dispute," says Dowd, remarking that the body was buried after Christian ritual, with his head pointed west.
"It was probably buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd told FoxNews.com that whoever planted the tree did not know of the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents showing that there was a church and cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of discovery: the height of the young man.
"It was 1 metre 77", says Dowd.
For early medieval society, that means quite a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
The National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent nearly $1.5 million studying what young children think about food.
The project, referred to as "The way babies and young children perceive food" is carried out by the University of Chicago and, so far, has determined that young children are not prone to eating foods licked by other people or on which other people have sneezed.
According to the project's financier, "adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets".
There is evidence to suggest that the first food models of babies and young children have lasting consequences for the health of the entire life.
The premise for this study is that research on how babies look at food is missing.
"Despite the complexity and significance of food selection, child development psychologists have devoted surprisingly little attention to studying how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food, the financier said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social influences on the choice and consumption of food in babies and young children.
Researchers say babies have "limited knowledge in the food field".
Children between the ages of three and six "know more about food than babies and young children", however they are "extremely picky consumers".
An actress who starred in "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who starred in the television series "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in eastern Tennessee, accused of exposing herself to children.
Several media channels report actress Jennifer Ann Lien, 41, who played Kes in the television series, is charged with two indecent exposure offences, involving children under the age of 13, according to the arrest report.
Officers of the Roane County Sheriff's Office brought the arrest warrant on September 3, to Lien's home in Harriman, where they say they found her naked under a blanket on the couch.
The officers said Lien refused their requests to dress.
Harriman police chief Randy Heidle says that Lien has been charged with several counts, including aggravated bodily harm, after the April incident in which he says Lien entered a police car with his personal car.
It's still not known if he has a lawyer.
Police identified the murdered victim found in Epping Forest
A man whose decomposing corpse was discovered in a tourist forest has been identified.
On 9 September, Hidir Aksakal, 53, was found close to Hollow Ponds in the Epping Forest, northeast of London.
The Turkish-born man lived in Margate, Kent, and had close ties to the Green Lanes area of Haringey, north of London.
He was last seen in Green Lanes on the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved he was killed, and detectives say his body had probably been in Epping Forest for several weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo, of the metropolitan police, said: "Mr. Aksakal was well known locally as the Chetin Boxer and we hope to learn from the Green Lanes community information to help us with the investigation.
Hollow Ponds is a crowded and popular tourist spot, where there is a cafe and lake for boat rides.
It is also surrounded by streets with heavy traffic.
We're asking everyone who's been in the area for the past few weeks and maybe they've noticed any unusual or suspicious activity, come and talk to us.
Super Chief: Six Women Juggling Between Maternity and Service
Unlike any other country in the world, except Papua New Guinea, there is no centralised policy on paid maternity leave in the United States.
Two weeks ago, when Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer announced that she was pregnant with twins, but was going to take a very short maternity leave and "work in the period" of her free time, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture waiting for superwomen or nothing.
But is Mayer, herself a symbol of the top woman, to blame for unrealistic expectations?
How are other women leaders doing?
Seema Patel, lawyer and deputy director of the San Francisco Bureau of Labor Standards Enforcement, had just obtained a job in the government in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss stunned her with unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss told her.
But if you're going to start a family in the future, start taking your leave now.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't get a single day of paid maternity leave as part of her employment contract.
At the time, Patel was unmarried and highly career-focused, and the family was the last thing on her mind.
But she took her boss’s advice.
She avoided using her sick days for four years, so when she became pregnant with her first child, two years ago, she had collected three months of paid leave.
Six months ago, when she gave birth to her second child, Patel could no longer apply the same strategy.
The four months of leave he took were entirely unpaid.
Patel says she did not feel any rejection from her colleagues, but has a problem with the structure of the work.
"I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: your country does not put any value on becoming a parent.
Karen Choi, vice president at Capital Group asset management firm, says that any female employee who is also a mother should be praised.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes juggling between motherhood and the job as "a constant struggle".
The secret not to sink is to have "an incredible family by your side" and a babysitter and a babysitter, to accept that there are things you're not gonna be the best at ("not everyone can be Martha at interior fittings") and simply go through with it.
Choi says he took an increasing maternity leave for each child, starting at two and a half months for the first and finishing six months for the last.
This makes her an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, he has a fever, he vomits and you stay up all night to take care of him and you know that the next morning you have to take your other children to school, then you have to go to work...
Then it gets very complicated," she says.
But her company supported her and mentions that her investment portfolio performance did not suffer at all.
When she entered the finance industry, after university, about 20 of her college colleagues had chosen the same path, she says.
Today, about 90% of them gave up.
Women who quit their jobs, then start again don't have the same chances at top paid jobs, she says.
It is difficult to stay: "In the short term it is a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen".
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me move forward is that I want to be a role model for them.
The idea of being an example to her four children is what motivates 48-year-old science researcher and teacher Kelly Posner.
Children know that their mother is literally helping to save lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Center for Suicide Risk Assessment at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "great goal" in terms of career and fulfill it.
It's very important that women think they can have a vision.
Most can't afford to believe that," she says.
She once gave a presentation to 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a webinar, when she was eight months pregnant.
She also helped technology, she says, for she can stop the car and answer the phone after picking up her children or answering an e-mail on the move.
Juggling between motherhood and a demanding career has been helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. Of the ability to carry things out even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33, executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and mother of two children, says that to make maternity and career work together only through private aid networks such as nannies, is wrong.
"You shouldn't be lucky or win the lottery to be successful," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - noting very low wages, poor health care and the lack of paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't care for each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers who just gave birth.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, gave birth to her child while receiving scholarship.
With a husband and child relying on health care provided by the scholarship, the labor leader was able to take a maternity leave of only two weeks, then returned to work.
Lisa Mosko, fashion stylist and mother of two children, says that fewer and fewer women will abandon their profession if they benefit from more social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining agreed programs and accepting that effective work does not mean staying overtime.
At the forefront of logistical constraints, Mosko says, is the additional pressure to work in a field where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of lack of taste ("mother clothes" represent one of the worst insults).
"Image is part of our job - it picks you up or pulls you down," she explains.
Mosko's "Permanent Negotiation" for her multiple roles to work harmoniously means to maintain her chic appearance and a beautiful bag in her hand, from which, however, sometimes another toy-two should fall.
If he remembers that men are fathers too, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men for not being good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York housing authority, who handles the homes of more than 400,000 New Yorkers and employs more than 11,000 people, says maternity and career does not mean talking about "balance".
The notion of equilibrium is a little improper.
It looks more like a rocking chair," she says.
Mother of three children, one of whom is only three months old, she has just taken a seven-week maternity leave after giving birth this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to take paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible schedule, which meant to leave early or late, so that she could breastfeed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning ending at 06:00 ("cheapier than therapy") still breastfeeding.
At work, he tried to create a "friendly to parents" environment, in which delay due to a child is allowed, and email response does not necessarily have to be sent from the office.
"The concept and the notion of family have changed and is changing a lot," Olatoye says.
"The family is very different from what had been 25 or even 10 years ago".
It's the job that needs to adapt.
Russian humorists say they tricked Elton John about a phone call from Putin
To the cynics it seemed too good to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, to Sir Elton John, singer and sex minority rights campaigner, in which to discuss gay rights.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant Instagram posting in which he thanked the Russian leader for addressing him on the matter, it immediately became clear that whoever called him on Monday night had certainly not been Putin.
The Kremlin had already stated that he had no knowledge of that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humorists admitted that they, not the president, had been the foreign voices at the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was unlikely Putin would want to meet him or call him, or at least not too soon," says Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, while his colleague, Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, posed as the President's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov.
"But it seems that Elton John was really waiting for this call, so he immediately thought that, indeed, it was a conversation with the righteous people we were posing for," he told the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said, "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day".
This day and this conversation have been the most wonderful and delightful of my life.
As to consummate John's embarrassing situation, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not give statements on hoax speculation.
The basis of the story is the comments the singer made over the weekend, in which he criticized Putin for his "ridiculous" attitude towards homosexuals while campaigning for LGBT rights in Kiev, criticizing mostly a Russian law passed in 2013, which prohibits the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
"I'd like to meet [Putin], talk to you," John told the BBC, saying that although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it was worth a try though.
Then, on Monday evening, the singer sparked some observers' mistrust when he published a message on a social network, stating that Putin responded to his critics by taking the phone and calling him.
He said he "looked forward to meeting [the President] face-to-face, to discuss LGBT equality in Russia".
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the other end of the line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for phone calls given jokingly to many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks good English, played Peskov and claimed to be the performer of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, the real Peskov told journalists on Tuesday that Putin would be "ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but that no such request was received in the Kremlin from the singer.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the station on Instagram, he added, "especially because it is not written entirely in correct English".
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written with such grammar mistakes.
Even before the Russian duet declared its prank publicly, local media already suspected that John had been the victim of a joke.
Some online users had identified Krasnov as guilty, known for pranking politicians with phones he records and posts on his YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Joke phone calls to public figures, then publishing records have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many to be the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent for pranking Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television imitating Anton Gerashchenko, the direct adviser to the interior minister, Arsen Avakov.
He so well imitated Gerashchenko, that last year he spoke to the former governor of Dnipropetrovsk, Ihor Kolomoiski, for more than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary election, which led to massive street protests after reports of massive fraud.
Citing as Arkadi Dvorkovich, then President Dmitri Medvedev's adviser, convinced election commission chairman Vladimir Churov that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, his victims included former USSR President Mikhail Gorbachev, Kiev Mayor and boxing champion Vitali Klitschko and Russian Sports Minister Vitali Mutko, whom he tricked into apologizing for the drunken behaviour of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko, posing as the son of the sacked Ukrainian leader, Viktor Yanukovich.
It was so convincing that the person at the other end, whose voice resembled Lukashenko's, offered him asylum.
John's initial claim that he would like to talk to Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Legislator Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the law on "propaganda", told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with a "subject so irrelevant" and that he was ready to meet with the singer to explain Russia's position.
The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online poll for readers, in which 39% of respondents felt Putin and John should meet, and 22% felt that such a meeting would harm Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than from malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people per year die prematurely from external air pollution, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, especially in Asia, is burning wood and coal for heating homes and cooking, but research reveals that an equally alarming reason is agricultural emissions from Europe and the US, where they are the main reason for these deaths.
The report warns that unless action is taken, the death toll - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projections should sound an alarm for public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, an environmental health expert, at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air rain are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three-fourths of the 3.3 million deaths annually, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory disease.
Research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which is estimated to cause an additional 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in the Nature newspaper, is the first to highlight various sources of external air pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths they cause, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computer model of the global atmosphere, to assess the impact of air pollution on various populations, including new information on how pollution affects the inhabitants of China and India.
One third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-extinguishing fuels such as wood and coal, for home heating or cooking, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all of which were recognized hazards.
The consumption of this type of internal energy causes half of India's 645,000 annual deaths and one third of China's 1.4 million annual deaths.
But research found that agricultural ammonia emissions had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Leveld of the Max Planck Chemical Institute in Germany, who led the research.
One-fifth of global deaths are caused by these emissions, mainly from cattle, birds and pigs and overuse of fertilisers.
Ammonia reacts with exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, being the main cause of death due to air pollution in the eastern US, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing one-fifth of the dead despite measures against polluting vehicles.
It caused only 5% of deaths globally, but the figure could increase as more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Air pollution by plants, especially those operating on coal, was significant globally, causing one in seven deaths.
In the US it is the single main factor, causing one third of the 55 000 deaths annually, compared to 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid and dusty regions, caused nearly one fifth of the deaths globally caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The overlapping between the high degree of pollution and the large number of residents says their word on public health, but there is little known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and potentially important for the protection of public health at global level.
At present it is assumed that all particles are equally toxic.
But if those caused by fuel burning are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths attributable to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, Jerrett says "the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and because it suggests that much more attention must be paid to agricultural sources, both from scientists and political leaders".
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmosphere specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom said, "The study does underline the need for air quality control, to avoid these deaths, especially in highly populated areas of Asia".
A statement by Victor Ponta strains even more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Romanian prime minister speaks of attitudes that remind Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already strained after the announcement on the construction of a fence on the border with Romania, after the Serbian border, experienced a new depreciation following statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the Budapest authorities on Monday of treating refugees "with bat and insert".
Hungarian diplomacy reacted harshly by speaking of "extremist and lying" claims, but Victor Ponta also did not give up and accused neighbouring government officials of being "a disgrace" to Europe.
It should be noted that this is not the first time Ponta has tried to strain Romano-Hungarian relations through statements made in delicate or electoral moments.
It all started from a statement made by Victor Ponta on Monday, in which he tried to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.
The problem is our logistical ability to treat those people like people, not how our Hungarian neighbours treat them with bats and inserts.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu put himself at the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that existed in all societies, namely a xenophobic feeling.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's up to us to solve the problem.
"We will treat those people as we do," the Truth quoted Victor Ponta as saying Monday.
It is unclear what Victor Ponta meant when he spoke about the insertion of refugees, but the Czech Republic was recently at the heart of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of migrants on several trains, in a gesture that mentioned the procedure used by the Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners in concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian news agency MTI, taken over by magyaridok.hu, that perhaps the internal political crises that rocked Victor Ponta's position make him "extremist and lying" statements.
The Romanian business officer in Budapest has been summoned to provide explanations, informs Mediafax, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inadequate statements about how Hungary handles the immigrant crisis," the Hungarian Foreign Ministry notes.
Levente Magyar, Secretary of State for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, expressed the "surprised" about Victor Ponta's "constant attempts to save his controversial moral position by anti-Hungarian lies", underscores the diplomacy in Budapest.
"I do not wish to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives - but read the account below and you will understand the outrage I feel, as a European citizen and human, towards the mentalities and attitudes that Europe saw only in the 1930s-40s!!" Ponta wrote, on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European policies, he has "the duty" to attract attention and sanction "the constant behavior of some top-level government officials in Hungary" who are "a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union" by "anti-Semitic attitudes", "the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"Barbed wire, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, they are political decision-makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!", accused Ponta, saying that he believes in "solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions, and especially in the superiority of European values," and "what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction precisely with these goals and values!".
During the evening, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Hungarian military grabbed and shot or killed some children or women, in a speech in which he made several references to Nazism.
UDMR chairman Kelemen Hunor also intervened in the dispute, who felt that the Romanian authorities should not have a "sentimental approach" in connection with Hungary's intention to build a fence on the border.
The leader of the UDMR said that it must be understood that this solution is not directed against Romania or Romanian citizens, showing that the fence might even help our country not become an intense route transited by migrants who want to reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to point out, to say, that we don't have to get hysterical, to take this whole thing as something against Romania and we don't have to use it to worsen the not-so-good relations between the two governments anyway, because that's not the case.
I think every sentimental, visceral approach is not right.
"We need to see the rational part, see why we came here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, the Romanian citizens and does not prevent free movement between the two states, within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
West ignored Russia's bid in 2012 to remove Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia proposed more than three years ago to remove Syria's President Bashar al-Assad as part of a peace agreement, according to a senior official involved at the time in closed negotiations between the western countries and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
Former President of Finland and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said Western powers had not taken advantage of the then proposal.
From 2012 to the present, tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have had to flee the country, giving rise to the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari held talks with representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, United Kingdom, France, Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
He also said that during the talks, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin offered a plan that included among other things Assad's proposal to give up power at some point after the start of peace talks between the regime and the opposition.
He proposed three things:
One - we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we must initiate a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.
"Three - we must look for an elegant way for Assad to withdraw," Ahtisaari said, reporting the Russian ambassador's position.
But he also said Ahtisaari, the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator was going to fall, that they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a missed opportunity in 2012," the former President of Finland continued.
Officially, Russia has strongly supported Bashar al-Assad throughout the four and a half years of war, insisting that his removal cannot be a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad believes Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow has recently begun sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria in an effort to stabilise Assad's regime and confront the extremists of the Islamic State.
Antenna 3's live Internet program will be available for a fee
Antenna 3 informed its viewers on Tuesday that from November 1 its live program will be able to be viewed online for a fee, based on a monthly subscription.
In a "letter to the viewers", the Intact Trust news station stated that "we are doing this with a tight heart, wishing to stay with us at this new stage, imposed by market conditions".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who are watching us online", the television promising that the viewing will be at a very good quality.
Antenna 3 claims that "all these live broadcasts from the country and abroad, campaigns, daily news have been and are possible through a constant, assumed financial effort that entailed a permanent refurbishment and focus on quality."
We managed to support ourselves, as the online and offline distributors contributed nothing to the content offered.
The announcement comes as the TV news program is accessible based on subscription and the online platform Antena Play, where, by the way, the recordings of the broadcasts from Antene were most often accessible exclusively.
Reports show that populations of marine animals and plants have halved over the past 40 years
The scale of the crisis facing marine animals and plants is documented in detail in a study that states that marine species around the globe, including those essential to the safety of human food, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions at the global ocean ecosystem combine and create a whirlpool of difficulties for almost all marine life, says WWF's "Live Blue Planet" report.
Coral reefs are subject to serious decline risks (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and seagrass, on which many other species depend, have experienced a significant decline, while entire populations of commercially valuable fish, such as mackerel and tuna, have plummeted by three quarters since the 1970s, the report says.
Many coral reefs, usually described as ocean rainforests due to their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the middle of this century if ocean acidity continues to worsen, as a result of increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere, causing a directly proportional increase in carbonic acid levels in the sea.
"Healthy seas are a source of extraordinary natural beauty and astonishment and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, chief adviser on marine policies at WWF-UK, who contributed to the report.
"By overfishing, which damages coastal habitats, and without solving the problem of global warming, we sow the seeds of an ecological economic catastrophe," Dr. Heaps says.
The report, based on a review of published scientific literature, but also on the Living Planet Index, a database maintained by the Zoological Society of London, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Nearly 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It researched a great diversity of marine species, from fish, sea turtles and sea cucumbers - a worm-like animal, with rough skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that algae areas had decreased by about 30% in the last century, while total mangrove areas decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of shrimp fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
Over a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their shoals.
Deep changes are needed to ensure abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, general director of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines occurred in species fished for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations from 17 species belonging to the family Scrombidae - mackerel, tuna and sardines - decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, with no signs of recovery, the report says.
We are in a fishing race that could end with people being deprived of a vital food source and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and poor communities, which rely on the sea, will be hit the fastest and strongest," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic decline and undermine our struggle to eradicate poverty and malnutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, scientific director of the ZL, said, "These alarming figures prove how quickly humans change plants and animals in the oceans and represent a clear warning about the problems we might face as a result".
Seagrass: sprawling submarine "grass", which catches mineral-rich sediments and stabilizes the seabed.
Over the last century, the surface area has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, with almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of all mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly due to human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most biologically productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in or near coral reefs, but three-fourths of these are currently under threat and many may disappear over the course of this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to worsen.
Habitats in the deep: very little is known about the deeper areas of the ocean, but the decline in the amount of fish caught in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by global marine change.
Steven Gerrard denies allegations of racism that would have been brought to him by his former Liverpool teammate, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his working autobiography "My Story" ("My Story"), serialized by the Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player by saying that he "is not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague he liked "the least" in his 17 years at the club.
In reaction, Diouf would have responded to Gerrard on Senegalese radio station Groupe Futures Medias, with translated quotes attributed to the striker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked black people".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any allegations of racism against him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who has also before made public his poor opinion of Diouf, criticized his former colleague's attitude and professionalism.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his wasted seasons at Liverpool as an example of how things can go wrong," he writes.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he doesn't care at all about Liverpool," he continued.
For example, the way he spat out a giant and viscous phlegm in a Celtic fan in a Parkhead Uefa Cup match in March 2003 is evidence of his contemptuous and rancid behavior.
Diouf proved a controversial figure throughout his time on Anfield, with his most notorious night being the one on Celtic Park.
The Senegalese forerunner was questioned by police after the spit episode and fined for the value of his two-week salary at the club, with £60,000 donated to a humanitarian organisation of Celtic's choice.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard then wrote.
I felt he wasn't exactly willing to make all the effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who now plays at Malaysian club Sabah, in turn publicly criticized Gerrard and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf called Gerrard "selfish" and claimed that no one on Anfield liked the player who led the team to the Champions League victory in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "jealous".
He said: "Gerrard is simply jealous of me.
He didn't achieve the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came up with boss status, and he lives there.
I am respected in the world of football, the greatest football experts have framed me among the top seven players at the World Cup and among the top 100 players of the century.
Many great players do not have a sense of belonging.
Wherever I go in other countries, I am revered, while Gerrard is booed whenever he leaves his hometown of Liverpool.
From Hero to Professional Dancer: Alek Skarlatos' Quick Road to "Dancing With the Stars"
This season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Skarlatos does not just play the hero in uniform.
He is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, the producers say.
"It picks up many categories and we are always looking for the most popular of the moment," said Deena Katz, executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear I'll find the agent after this.
He's charming.
He's got something special.
Before he competed in the famous show - but just weeks before - Skarlatos made it to the international press after taking a stand in the face of great danger.
He and his two childhood friends, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, immobilized a man armed with an AK-47 on a train full of passengers travelling from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three stopped what could have been a mass murder by a possible terrorist.
Afterwards, the 22-year-old Skarlatos, sentry in the National Army, who grew up nearby Sacramento, received a call from President Obama, a Twitter message from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the U.S. Army and the French government.
Although he may have anticipated some local acclaim - on Friday, at Sacramento, there was a parade in honor of the young man - he did not expect so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Not in a million years would I have thought I would get this offer," Skarlatos confessed on Saturday, on a break from dance rehearsals with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though before Monday night's performance he admitted to being "slightly excited", he handled himself as a professional at his first foxtrot, achieving scores that brought him almost to the lead of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonioli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said he offered one of the best performances of the evening.
Katz and executive producer at "DWTS" Rob Wade said they wanted to keep an open spot in the show for guest contestants on the last hundred yards, such as Skarlatos' case, which grew in the public eye.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation, who foiled a gun attack on a train with 500 passengers and immediately thought to invite one of them to the dance contest.
He searched social networks, found family members and sent messages to Skarlatos.
When it appeared on "Good Morning America" to recount the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the sister program at ABC to avoid going through all media dams.
He supported his "five-minute pledition", then looked forward to finding out if Skarlatos would accept to participate in the "DWTS".
"For a while everything was very uncertain, because that's so different from what he does," Katz confessed.
A little while ago he was fighting in Afghanistan, and now I was asking him if he wanted to dance.
Skarlatos, who is on a short leave from the National Guard, had not even seen an entire show until recently.
Hesitant to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be just highlighted.
The show could not invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace up their sleeve: Noah Galloway, war veteran, with his hand and leg amputated.
They encouraged Skarlatos to call Galloway, the fans' favorite contestant and finalist of last season, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, along with Katz's incessant "tracking" and "insistent messages," she said.
"Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will be depicted and how the image of my friends will be protected," Skarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Skarlatos, a great lover of sports and history, had never danced before, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to make him relax and give up his rather rigid military posture.
But Katz says she is confident that she will adapt and that the audience will react positively.
He'll get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he's done.
"How can you not support him?" Katz said.
But this will only take a few weeks.
To move on, he has to dance.
Skarlatos, who is a bachelor and wishes to become a cop, says that, so far, he has had fun in this completely unknown environment to him.
The program represented the heaviest fight, having to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the times he was acclaimed in the media and the various award ceremonies.
He said that in late August, when he returned to the U.S. immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with the family.
"That took about a day and a half," he said.
In all, I stayed home for four days.
There is a risk in capturing a person who attracts media attention, but is not accustomed to being in the spotlight, executive producer Wade said.
And the show wants to make sure the contestant manages and has fun.
"The pressure is high and we want the participants to have a pleasant experience," Wade said.
"We wouldn't want Alek to ever say, "Oh, dear, what have I gotten myself into?"
Let's keep our fingers crossed for fun.
McRib from McDonald's is coming back.
The time has come for those who are waiting all year for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coasts to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of McDonald's franchises in the country offer this season special.
Last year, 75% of restaurants served the McRib sandwich.
"In the 2015 McLib promotion about 8000 restaurants participate," McDonald's spokeswoman Lisa McComb told The Times in an email.
In the US there are just over 14,300 restaurants of this fast food.
But according to McComb, individual franchise owners decide whether or not to serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they consider their local customers want.
And if you're still wondering what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain the ingredients to him last year, with a video showing reality.
According to the video, the McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year, at McDonald's restaurants attending.
There is also a website with locations where McRib is served (unaffiliated to McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and search for the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search of the site shows that the nearest McRib restaurant to Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.
Sometimes I just can't fight the craving for BBQ chicken pizza.
Keith Richards hints that he would prepare new Rolling Stones recordings
Keith Richards is back in the spotlight with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, however, soon the other Rolling Stones members may join him in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others at Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - had recently met in London and made "clear recording plans", as he says.
On Tuesday night, Richards spoke on the ICONS series at iHeartRadio with reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from the Stones would be the band's first LP after the 2005 "A Bigger Bang".
But the band was not inactive at all.
In recent years they have had many stadium tours and performed in several small concerts in L.A., including performances at Echoplex and Fonda Theatre.
At the last of these, they reinterpreted the 1971 classic LP, "Sticky Fingers".
In particular Richards was busy this year, collaborating on the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be released on September 18 on Netflix.
This year, he also released the solo album "Crosseyed Heart", his third solo in a five-decade career.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: "As always, Richards' harsh voice is a kind rather than distinguished instrument...."
But Richards stirs emotion in all 15 songs of the album and that has always meant, in fact, rock 'n' roll.
In the interview, Richards states that the band will most likely enter the studio after the South American tour early next year.
He gave no further details, however, judging by the last concerts, the band is still very lively.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman on Childhood, Matureness and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through a few difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them seem a lot simpler than they actually were.
Once a child actor on television shows such as "Silver Spoons", as an adult he reaffirmed himself as an inexpressive typical in the television series "Situation of Crisis" and in films such as " Nightmare Chiefs".
The first film he worked on as a director was the very acidic comedy "Bad Words", in which he also starred.
The film was nominated for the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, a tonally ambitious film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The screenplay is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, Pulitzer Prize winner, and Nicole Kidman and Bateman in the film, as the brothers in trouble.
The film has as its subject a festival seeking American cast.
Many reviews of the book considered it a comedy with strong emotional tints; the film reinterprets the story, placing more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview with our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I never saw the book like that," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and themes are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was addressing a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
Monday night's world premiere benefited from an introduction from the festival's program director, Kerri Craddock, who expressed enthusiasm especially for the sitcom "The Hogan Family" in the late '80s and early 1990s, on which Bateman worked. "I haven't met too many "Hogan Family" fans, Bateman sec said when he went on stage.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, now 46, into Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new film has a family named Fang at the center.
The parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their performances, for example plotting a bank robbery with lollipops or playing the role of very weak street musicians.
In adulthood, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) strive to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some fame, although she is famous for public scandals rather than performance, and Baxter is a novelist and magazine journalist who tries to become famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear under mysterious circumstances, Annie and Baxter suspect it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what exactly in the story of child actors who want to evolve into adult life was reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical one," confesses Bateman.
I started acting when I was 10, with my parents as managers, and this film has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as superficial and fun.
"It's a story I feel connected to and understand in depth," he added "and although I didn't try to add to it my personal experience, I knew very clearly what this film must look like to represent children with a nontraditional childhood".
The project began with Kidman, and she producer of the film, who obtained the rights to Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write the adaptation himself, he was co-opted Lindsay-Abaire, who adapted his own play "The Awakening to Reality", in which Kidman starred.
Bateman confesses that he accepted the chance to direct the film and star in it.
(Kidman, currently on stage in London in the production "Photograph 51", did not participate in Monday's premiere.
The book's trump was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film "an intelligent and caustic adaptation" which "tips the clichés of the much-exploited genre of the dysfunctional family and dissects the mission, sometimes of a lifetime, of children to understand their parents in ways that can be funny and sweet-bitter, incisive and usually very dark".
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very harsh portrait" and noted that Bateman "proves visible progress and greater maturity as a film director with this intelligently structured but never too cunning or mechanical adaptation".
After Monday's screening, when Bateman and Walken went on stage for the question session, the audience long cheered the beloved Walken.
About Bateman as a director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "He impressed me every day.
I couldn't believe the ease with which they were changing the work of director of the film, which is very difficult, and the one of actor in the scenes.
His focus is really amazing.
In a certain dialogue scene, Bateman sits on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hidden in the darkness, just a shadow in the profile, while Kidman is closer to the camera and can be seen more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine Bateman the actor talking to Bateman the director about the fact that he can't be seen.
"I find it incredibly interesting to direct films," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never make them to benefit myself as an actor.
Having the privileged position of being the one responsible for creating the entire experience for the public, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
It doesn't matter that that... actor wants a close-up.
During the question-and-answer session, Bateman confessed that after reading the script, he immediately thought of Walken for the role of Caleb, but also composer Carter Burwell for the soundtrack.
Known mainly for his long-standing friendship with the Coen brothers, Burwell composed the soundtrack for two other films present at the Toronto festival: the animated film "Anomalisa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Gangsters of Legend", Brian Helgeland's performance of the 1960s English gangster twins Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell also composed the soundtrack for Todd Haynes' film "Carol".
"Things with elongated or obtuse tones seem very interesting to me," Bateman says, giving several explanations Tuesday.
Sail among those tonalities and guide the harmonious and somewhat elegant audience from one tone to the next, throughout the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both as a director and an actor, in a career dominated by reinvention and determination, a mixture of comedy and drama, light and darkness.
As Bateman confessed when he finished his introduction for the film at Monday's world premiere, "For good, for bad, it came out exactly the way I wanted it to".
The festival roars like the Oscars about the Boston Globe investigation story about pedophile priests
Did you win $240,000 in the lottery?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered ticket to the X-Lotto extraction was purchased from the Ingle Farm Shopping Centre on Montague Rd on Saturday, August 15.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia another 16 winning entries were recorded throughout Australia, which shared their X-Lotto's estimated single prize pool of $4 million.
SA Lotteryes asks everyone who bought tickets to X-Lotto from Ingle Farm Lotteryes Kiosk to check on them as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the extraction of X-Lotto 3555 on Saturday, August 15, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
Additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, manager of Ingle Farm Lotteryes Kiosk, says he looks forward to receiving the good news that the one who won the top prize has checked his ticket to X-Lotto.
"We have tried our best to spread the word, for a person is our winner and has no idea," she said.
Forensics detectives are searching the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where the missing man Daniel Hind was last seen.
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it was frustrating to sit around waiting for information about her missing brother, especially because police offered two different versions of his journey from the night he was last seen.
Her family had asked police to search the house since her brother's disappearance.
"We were hoping they would search the house, we were not informed they would," she said.
Miss Hind also says that her family also wanted those who knew what had happened to her brother to speak and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to find out where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have a lot of other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half think he's not.
Either way, we want him at home and put an end to the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometers of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635km of new highways and repair 17,000km of existing main and secondary roads.
Completion of work on the Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all part of pan-European transport corridors, is among the priorities in the road infrastructure development plan approved Wednesday.
The plan aims to create sustainable road infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure greater road safety and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria transit country for Syrian cultural goods trafficking
According to Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for illicit trafficking of stolen cultural goods from the Middle East, due to its geographical location.
During a speech Wednesday at a conference on the fight against looting the Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was being redone to fit the new context, emphasising a ban on cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of Interior, especially the Directorate General for the "Fighting of Organised Crime" (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and the illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have placed third, after Italy and Greece, at the top of the trafficking of cultural objects and goods.
Bulgaria's interior minister also showed that the trafficking of cultural objects and the destruction of historic sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a growing phenomenon, described as an extremely serious war crime.
He insisted that concerted and decisive measures are needed to stop the intentional destruction of history.
UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova noted that footage of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrates that the country is affected by industrial-scale robbery.
Participants in Wednesday's conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously endangered and that the international community must unite to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods from the war-torn country.
Aerojet Rocketdyne says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
On Tuesday, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc said it expects to complete the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019, to replace a Russian engine that will be banned soon, but the date could be changed if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Aerojet Vice President Julie Van Kleeck refused to give statements that Aerojet offered $2 billion to buy the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture with equal shares for rocket launches of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say the bid amount is a strategic move by Aerojet to outrun its rival Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, who develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan rocket.
ULA says Blue Origin's engine program is about two years ahead of Aerojet's AR-1 engine, a claim that Aerojet contradicts.
Working on the new engines became a priority after U.S. legislators approved a ban on the use of RD-180 Russian engines for the launches of U.S. military or spy satellites, after Russia's annexation of the Crimean region of Ukraine last year.
Van Kleeck states that Aerojet was testing hardware equipment for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensional printed parts to fit into both the ULA's Atlas 5 rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, and the new Vulcan rocket that the ULA is developing and costing about $1 billion.
Aerojet states that it will be less expensive and less risky to integrate its engine into the Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a completely new engine and rocket, as the ULA currently plans.
Van Kleeck says Aerojet was planning to start testing large-scale engines in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be delayed if the company does not receive enough funding from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first semester of fiscal year 2016, which begins in October.
She also states that the entire company was anxious to see how the Air Force would split some $160 million in funding among rival competitors.
It also says that Aerojet was considering trying other private financing options for the engine, but did not provide any details.
Competition from the Air Force is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding, and the Air Force covers two-thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies (Space Exploration Technologies), or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both of which are private companies, have self-financed their engine creation process and say they do not necessarily seek funding from the government.
The brewing company AB InBev plans a $275 billion merger with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the largest brewing company in the world, approached rival company SABMiller (SAB.L) about a takeover that would form a colossus that would produce one third of the total beer in the world.
Such a merger would have a market value of around $275 billion at current prices and combine AB InBev' dominance in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing fast-growing markets, but also with their Asian breweries.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also a few places in Asia and Latin America," said analyst Andrew Holland of Societe Generale.
AB InBev and other top brewing companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weaknesses in North America and Europe, where consumers increasingly prefer beer produced by independent players or wine or spirits.
SABMiller, the world-leading company and producer of more than 200 brands of beer, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that she had been informed of AB InBev's intention to make her an offer, which must happen by 14 October at the latest, according to British laws.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private equity fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, famous for its policy of reducing costs at the expense of marketing, previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, ketchup producer Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
A close source of the SAB mentioned that it was too early to say what it would do, as they did not receive any offers.
"At this point, we are in the phase waiting and deciding," the source said.
Speculation about a merger, which would most likely raise concerns about breaches of competition rules in markets such as the United States and China, has circulated for several years.
The timing of the approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions made by AB InBev, follows a decrease of approximately 15% in the price of SABMiller shares starting in August.
"It's exactly the moment they were waiting for," said analyst Phil Gorham of Morningstar.
Financially, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least £40 (62 USD) per SAB Miller share, perhaps even £45, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to $130 billion, which would also include SABMiller debt.
That would make it the largest M&A transaction of 2015, which is already announced a record year after the 2008 financial crisis in terms of the amount of the transaction, and one of the largest purchases since 1980.
SAB shares approached 19.9% at £36.14, giving it a US$90 billion stock capitalization.
AB InBev actions reached 6.4%.
Heineken rivals (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that the SAB could seek another merger as a defense strategy, as happened the previous year when it offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, he has combined his African bottle bottler of soft drinks with that of Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in recent weeks there has been the suspicion of a combination with Diageo or Australian beverage firm Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The global brewing market share of AB InBev, producer of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, was in 2014 21.1%, while SABMiller's was 15%, according to Plato Logic industry experts.
AB InBev plans a 2-fold ratio between net debt and gross profit (EBITDA) from today's 2.5.
It is possible to reach the target in 2016, the nearest realistic date on which the transaction could be concluded, so it would be possible to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought the Budweiser-producing company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 for US$52 billion, the largest cash purchase in history at the time. he let the ratio grow to more than 5 times.
An equally high climb would allow him to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
Families that control AB InBev own slightly more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders at SABMiller are the Altria cigarette manufacturer (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altria refused to give statements that they had been approached by AB InBev, but on September 9, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said at an analysis conference that he was regularly assessing the investment in SABMiller and that "this time we believe that maintaining assets is in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, the chief responsible for European investment, equity, at Allianz Global Investors, which owns shares in both companies, says AB InBev faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debts reaches around 15%.
But we believe that the profit from this acquisition would be a disappointing 8% after 10 years," Dwane said.
In the case of any combination there are significant hardships related to the violation of competition rules, especially in the United States, where companies hold about 70% of the beer market.
"The economies that could be made to distribution operations are large, and obstacles related to competition rules violations are even greater," said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross Business School at Michigan University.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain the 58 per cent share company held by SABMiller under the operating agreement governing it.
A change of control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to obtain an additional 8 percent and appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would be entitled to the first and final bid for the remaining 50 percent.
A spokesman for Molson refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an auction, but Molson's shares rose by more than 12 per cent to their highest value.
Any merger may also have to sell shares in China, where the market leader is SABMiller's CR Snow joint venture with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or China's Tsingtao could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that after the collapses, the combined group could hold a 28% share of the global market.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warshaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accuse former Air Force pilot of helping al Qaeda
Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who would later have donated funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, police officers told Reuters on Wednesday, in a rare case targeting those helping financially activism.
The suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern city of Karachi.
He paid for the treatment of injured Taliban militants at a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in an attack on a bus with members of the Ismaelian Shiite Muslim minority, following which 45 people died, senior police officer Naveed Khawaja of the province's Department for Combating Terrorism told journalists.
He will be charged with financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has funded the Afghan Taliban before, we are still running research to see if he provided financial aid through his businesses or behind him is someone else," the officer said.
" Ahmed also provided financial aid for AQIS," said, referring to the Al Qaeda organization on the Indian Subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for Pakistani police forces, facing activism, corruption and crime.
After, in December, Taliban Rifles massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government vowed to stifle activism.
There have been tough attacks, while the military has also advanced further into tribal regions outside the law on the Afghanistan border.
But militant groups remain a threat and many have followers from Pakistani cities who are under the control of very poorly prepared police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52, used to preach at a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public sermons were moderate, but in particular he encouraged radicalism, police said.
He studied at the Pakistan Air Force College in the city of Sargodha and left the Pakistan Air Force in 1998, another security official told Reuters under anonymity.
He later entered the paint and chemical industry.
Rapper Rick Ross was denied copyright application for "Everyday I'm hustlin"
New York rapper Rick Ross cannot claim royalties for the words "Everyday I'm hustlin'", ruled an American judge, rejecting his complaint against the LMFAO music group, which sold T-shirts with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
In a decision published by the Miami federal court on Tuesday, District Judge Kathleen Williams said that Ross' slogan, a prominent part of his 2006 debut hit, "Hustlin'", is an abridged expression for which courts have mentioned several times that he cannot receive copyright.
Williams' court ruling weakens the lawsuit for copyright infringement that Ross, whose true name is William Leonard Roberts II, filed against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed the Los Angeles electropop duet, made up of Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied "Hustlin'" for their own famous 2010 song "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflein'".
The hip hop star asserted that the LMFAO song is "an obvious attempt to capitalize on the fame and success of Hustlin'".
He also sued Kia Motors for using the song "Party Rock Anthem" in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed the LMFAO violated his copyright, selling T-shirts and other products with the shufflelin' slogan.
In Tuesday's court ruling, Williams says that "Hustlin'", as a melody, is protected by copyright law.
But Ross' three-word slogan is made up of ordinary words and cannot have royalties, she said.
The judge compared it to other famous lyrics from past music, such as "you got the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it is "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared as impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the LMFAO band's song was an unauthorized copy of "Hustlin'".
The trial is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO's lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al, at the U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr Carson approaches Trump in the Republican Party's most recent presidential poll
According to the most recent presidential poll for 2016, novice politician Ben Carson approaches bombastic leader Donald Trump in the Republican preliminary election.
Carson scored 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped in the polls by seven points.
After supporting 27% Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll, Carson, retired neurosurgeon, comes in second with 23 percent, followed by Bush, television star Mike Huckabee, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, each with 6%.
Support from Republican voters in the preliminary election increased from early August to early September for Trump, Carson, Ohio Governor John Kasich and former Chief Executive of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two, however, remains at one-digit numbers.
Jeb Bush, former Governor of Florida and the one carrying on the Bush family standards, dropped by seven percentage points in a month, while Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last poll, support for Walker is 2%.
Carson has drawn greater support than Trump among college graduates (29% versus 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in voters' preferences without a university degree (30% versus 19%).
Trump is supported more by men than by women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the poll said they were determined which candidate to stand for in their state's preliminary elections.
Those who have stated that they know who they will vote for support Trump twice as much as they support Carson.
It is still too early to say for 63% of Republican voters for the preliminary election.
The results of the CBS/NYT poll held between September 9th and 13th will be made public on Tuesday, ahead of a Republican presidential debate.
Carson's rise in this poll reflects that of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders to the leader for the Democrats' nomination for President, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The last pursuit of CBS presidential nominations shows that Sanders climbed by 10 points and by 22 points in Iowa and New Hampshire respectively, among Democratic voters for the preliminary.
A renowned ethics specialist says sex robots should be banned
A renowned ethics specialist in the robotics industry has launched a campaign calling for a ban on the development of sex robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, robotics expert from De Montfort University in Leicester, England, warns that sex robots could contribute to the systematic dehumanization of women and children.
"Sex robots seem to be an increasingly important topic in the robotics industry, and the models they inspire themselves from - the way they will look, the roles they will have - are very disturbing," she told the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sex robots is not one against sex, but against exploitation.
Technology is not neutral.
It draws inspiration from class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she said for the Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will help increase sexual exploitation.
Although the sex robots that are being manufactured now are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something more sinister.
It's new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it from happening.
The industry certainly seems to be taking off.
A few years ago, the inflatable puppet manufacturing company True Companion launched Roxxxxy, "the world's first sex robot".
However, concern about the possible dangers posed by artificial intelligence is not uncommon, even among large industry representatives.
Just this spring, Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk wrote of "the risk of, in five years, something really dangerous happening.
In an interview with the BBC last December, physicist theorist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of a complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
UK welcomes Syria's first refugees - RT UK
In the coming days, Britain will receive the first refugees to flee the Syrian war, Interior Minister Theresa May announced.
They will receive assistance under the extensive government resettlement programme.
Asylum-seeking refugees arrive from camps bordering the war-torn country.
They are the first of the 20,000 refugees the United Kingdom plans to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the interior minister said the government was "working quickly" to secure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that the assistance and support they need and deserve are already in place.
I know that honourable members and the general public want to know more about the number of people and the date on which they are expected to arrive.
May noted that the government must make further plans to ensure that refugees have adequate supplies when they arrive.
I must stress that the level of enlargement requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything is going well.
The Syrian refugee minister, Richard Harrington and I will continue to keep the House informed of this.
But I am pleased to tell the House that we are waiting to meet the first wave of refugees in the coming days, and we are working quickly to plan more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew his anger from MPs and militants when he revealed the government's plan for refugees, with many believing the figure was too low.
In September, Cameron said in the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to its moral responsibility" and receive 20,000 refugees from Middle East camps until the next general election.
He added that refugees would not automatically receive full asylum, but a humanitarian status allowing them to apply for asylum after five years.
But critics noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees a day, and former Liberal Democratic MP Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "desistors".
Further, Ashdown revealed that the children included in the scheme are expected to be deported when they turn 18 if they do not receive asylum.
Major stars and public figures also condemned the measures.
In a joint letter, big names such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said that the response to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of countries close to the conflicts that drive people out of their homes," they wrote.
Ruble recovers amid global uncertainty - RT Business
The Russian ruble strengthened on Wednesday, being traded 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Stock Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
Overall, the Russian currency earned seven percent from its lowest rate of 71 rubles for one dollar, on 24 August.
Analysts say that the return of the ruble occurred due to the reaction of investors to the present global market unrest caused by China's hardships, the possible increase in the interest rate of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the exaggerated reaction to cheap oil.
Brent's odds rose by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching $48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at $45.31 per barrel.

"It is possible that volatility will say its word, fueled by uncertainty about China and when the federal interest rate rises, which will continue to set the tone for oil prices and for the ruble," said Bloomberg Piotr Matys of Rabobank, an expert in strategies for monetary policies in emerging markets, set in London.
Experts also point to another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are related to the US dollar, have begun to buy rubles.
Global markets await the Federal Reserve's decision on Thursday, whether or not the interest rate will rise.
Markets believe that what could represent the first nine-year U.S. interest rate increase will not happen and have traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
Nasa and the United Kingdom are working together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the U.S. government and companies such as Google, Amazon and the phone company Verizon on developing a database that would allow drone pilots to book airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Collaboration comes as a result of a widespread unrest over the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes in vivid colors the potential negative effect.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or capturing data in high density urban areas, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," the research mentions.
Without a common set of technological protocols and aerial rules, chaos could set in.
According to Detta O'Cathain, Baroness of the House of Lords, concern has intensified amid reports of events at the limit of producing an accident and operating drones over football stadiums, close to nuclear power stations and the Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, over 400 calls made to metropolitan police have been related to drone incidents," said O'Cathin.
What is the solution: building a system to track all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, whether they are run by commercial pilots or amateurs.
"As more and more small drones conduct commercial flights at low altitude, beyond the pilot's visibility level, or even fully autonomous flights, some air traffic management infrastructure is needed to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, for example parcel delivery in cities," she said.
According to Nasa, this drone traffic management system will include services such as airspace design, methods to avoid bad weather and wind conditions, congestion management, route planning and rerouting by methods similar to the rules set for road traffic such as signaling and lanes.
They expect to have a working prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is about to explode in the European Union in the coming years.
"We are already seeing small and innovative EMS companies in the UK using this technology with considerable effects in the energy, agriculture and media industries," says Lord Tariq.
Over 670 permissions for commercial drone operations were granted in the United Kingdom alone by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission estimates that the drone industry could generate 150,000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Dislike button: why Facebook wants to know what makes you sad
"A Look Back" works similarly, gathering the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will that mean for the crowds of users inside Facebook's virtual borders, which are now more than the population of any country?
First, of course, an empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge value of Facebook - about $240 billion after the last statistic - is due to the unimaginable amount of consumer data it holds.
Every interaction, posting, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered together and build a remarkably complex picture, in a permanent update, about yourself and the preferences you have.
This is valuable primarily for advertisers, who can use all this information to carefully choose which people to see their ads on Facebook, selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another data set and certainly opens a door for another type of advertiser to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charities and promoters want to address those who, for example, "empathize" with the refugee crisis.
It will also probably change what you see in News.
Facebook uses incredibly intelligent and sophisticated algorithms to narrow down that enormous universe of content that you could see, in the smaller stream that you actually see.
This algorithm essentially depends on what you thought was interesting in the past and especially on what you liked.
Undoubtedly, there is a fear on Facebook that many interesting yet unfortunate posts do not enter into the algorithm, because people do not feel they should appreciate them.
However, if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it may decide to remove these kinds of posts from News.
Facebook has conducted experiments in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, in particular, how this is transmitted from person to person.
Representatives of the academia call this "emotional contamination" and, although it sounds sinister, it is probably just a simple attempt by Facebook (and published openly, with their consent) to better understand how their platform works and whether they can adjust algorithms to distribute more elements.
What happens to the empathy button is up to Facebook.
The really striking thing is how a single company's decision to add a single button to its services can produce so much speculation.
The reason this is happening may be that decisions made by Facebook -- whether it involves the visible buttons we see or the invisible algorithms that work in hiding -- have profound consequences for us today.
Now we spend a significant part of our life in the digital world, which we access to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and another one that fights a constant struggle for survival in the fierce Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions it takes, including on new buttons, will be those considered best suited to remain on the surface in this race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with that and soon they'll have a button for that.
Biometric bracelets can anticipate seizures in people with autism
During ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team determined that body signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, thus giving assistants the opportunity to take the right measures.
Kids with autism we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that his head hurts or that "there's too much noise here" or "I don't like this teacher".
If we want to understand them, we need to see what their body is telling us, and it is necessary to do so in a gentle and unintrusive way.
For example, simply viewing colors in an application can show the level of agitation. Red can be used to warn of a change in behavior, and blue for lack of interest, letting the assistant know that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
The data from the bracelets can be collected over time and saved on a secure server, helping carers understand the overview of how the person responds to various situations and what would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to make it very clear that we don't read minds.
Biometric sensors are not magical. They need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team would work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific to autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, director of customer services at the Wirral Autistic Society, who will present the technology at the 2015 Autech conference on autism and technology in Manchester, on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we work, you see the spectacular difference that assistance technology can bring in their quality of life. Now, iPad applications literally give a voice to people who have never spoken.
Robots help autistic children learn to play hide and seek.
"Who knows where this innovation could take us," she says.
Assistance technologies can truly change life and we feel they are part of our mission, as a charity for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and are also part of the debate on how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the coming weeks"
In the coming weeks, French warplanes would launch air strikes on Isis targets in Syria, the government announced on Wednesday, just days after President François Hollande had stated that the intervention was a "necessary one".
France will conduct its first air strikes on the jihadist group Islamic State in Syria "in the coming weeks," Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
The French air force has been running reconnaissance missions in Syria since 8 September, and the attacks will follow "in the coming weeks, as soon as we have clearly identified targets," Le Drian told radio station France Inter.
Le Drian said in parliament on Tuesday that the Islamic State had made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern Aleppo region.
"In the small town of the Sea there is an extremely strong offensive, and if this succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian national coalition or what's left of it," he said.
France is part of a US-led coalition that has been bombing Isis positions in Iraq for a year, but Hollande changed the strategy last week to expand action in Syria, with political pressure building up amid the jihadist threat France faces.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on Isis militants in Syria.
The commercial lock feature in iOS 9 will make the phone even faster
The newest version of iOS 9 is released on Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online publishers - is the ability to easily block ads during web browsing.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the mobile version of Apple's Safari browser.
On tests, it turned out that, after blocking ads, news sites such as the New York Times charge twice as fast, according to Reuters.
Blockage of advertisements also helps users conserve their data use and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several ad lock options, including 1Blocker, Blockr and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular ad lock tool for the desktop, launched its own iOS web browser that limits advertisements; its creator plans to release an extension for Safari in the future.
People who use commercial blocking software face some constraints.
Ads are still displayed in apps (from here Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including the Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such ad-blocking features.
However, their use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% the previous year.
Their development poses great challenges for online media, which is largely offered free of charge to consumers and has been financially supported for many years by advertising.
A report says that blocking ads could cost online publishers nearly 22 billion in revenue generated from advertisements this year alone.
To enable blocking of advertisements in iOS 9, users must download an application for blocking advertisements, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to enable an extension to block content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the immigrant crisis with the King of Spain
President Barack Obama met King King Felipe VI of Spain at the White House on Tuesday, where the two discussed various topics, but which probably came down to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the king addressed the subject of the fight against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - who are already facing hundreds of thousands of people who have left their home country to go west.
"Spain has worked very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travels, and the problem of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened in recent months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context of the Spanish territory of Catalonia voting in the elections to be held this month.
"As far as foreign policy is concerned, we are firmly committed to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The commander-in-chief also told King Felipe that he would like to visit his country before the end of his term in 2017.
"We welcome you with open arms," Felipe replied.
The First Lady, Michelle Obama, gave the Queen a tour of the White House and they had a tea talk.
That was the first visit by the royal couple to the United States of America since their accession to the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to pay a visit to South Florida.
Alfre Woodard joins the team of "Luke Cage"
The famous actress Alfre Woodard joined the cast of the upcoming Netflix series Luke Cage at Marvel. She will be the antagonist of Mike Colter, who plays the superhero who gives the series the title.
Woodard will play Mariah Dillard - "a local Harlem politician and cousin of Cornell character "Cottonmouth" Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali - who plans to bring an era of change to the streets she grew up on," says a press release.
Her personal life and professional career are messed up by Harlem's newest hero, Luke Cage, but also by the infamous actions of her cousin, Cottonmouth.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and intimidating presence on screen, which makes it perfect for the community leadership role in Harlem," mentions Jeph Loeb, executive producer and president of Marvel Television.
We are delighted that an actress as famous and talented as Alfre has agreed to join us on this adventure.
The series will premiere in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and work as showrunner and executive producer.

Luke Cage is one of four Marvel series in the Netflix franchise.
Also soon will be running Jessica Jones and Iron Fist, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" premiere world premiere on the same day
Fox predicts many positive results ahead of the premieres of two of his most expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season of Queens and the second of Empire will air on all Fox International channels one day after the domestic premiere.
As Variety reports, the strategy is a trend applied to high-profile serials, as traffic from global social networks guarantees success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to capitalize on the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for series that are being talked about a lot, such as Empire and Scream Queens," Fox International Channels President Hernan Lopez said, according to Deadline.
"We can't wait to air these very interesting series for fans all over the world," Lopez continued.
The viewers we serve daily bring the success of a series to the premiere and throughout its life cycle.
The next season of Empire, in which they will play famous celebrities such as Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, premieres in September.
The new series Scream Queens, starring Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande, will air the next day in September.
Members of the British Royal Family will participate in the world premiere of "Spectre"
Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend the world premiere of the latest James Bond film, "Spectre".
Kensington Palace announced the news on Twitter on Wednesday, designating the premiere as Royal Film Performance for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a producer press release, "Spectre" is the third Bond film chosen as the RFP since 1946.
In the past, for royal premieres have also been selected and "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on 26 October. at Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charitable one, following which will benefit backstage employees in the British film and television industry.
The premiere will also feature actors from the film's cast, including lead actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red carpet alongside members of the royal family.
"Spectre" will air in U.S. cinemas in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
Model Christie Brinkley and musician John Mellencamp were seen having dinner together on Monday, sparking rumours that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at the Bowery Hotel in New York City, where photographs surprised cheerful and smiling Brinkley.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing jeans, sneakers and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in torn jeans, coat and boots.
Last October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend whom he breaks up with constantly, actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the star in Message for you on NBC's Today show, saying it was "an angel that was sent to me and I'm very happy".
He also added that "nothing ends until it is over".
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, posed for Seventeen magazine, following in her mother's footsteps.
Arctic mosquito clusters are large enough to bring down a karibu
Many studies have shown species that have become more vulnerable due to the warmer climate, but global warming has proved to be a benefit to others.
One of these advantageous species is the Arctic mosquito.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, warmer temperatures in the Arctic region allowed mosquitoes here to appear early and grow higher, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers at the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their field observations to exemplify the effects of temperature changes on Arctic mosquitoes.
Their analysis anticipates a 50% increase in the survival rate of adult mosquitoes under conditions of a 2 degree Celsius increase in temperature.
Mosquitoes are small, but they are important members of the Arctic food chain and the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new paper published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B - aims to help biologists better anticipate how a population of growing mosquitoes could affect the karibu they feed on, the birds and insects that feed on them and the plants they pollinate.
To build their demonstration, Dartmouth scientists combined their field results with the results of laboratory experiments that researched how temperature influences insect development and the predisposition to be hunted by predators.
Although the increase in temperature makes larger mosquitoes more vulnerable to coleoptera, it also gives them an early start in spring and makes the development of their larvae more rapid and efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
Several mosquitoes mean a larger population, which can only develop to the extent that insect food sources can sustain it.
The ability of mosquitoes to transform their improved survival rate into an improved breeding rate depends on their ability to secure their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies so that the administration of antidepressants to pregnant women has no effect on the neural or behavioural development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are at increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is an even greater risk for women and their children, therefore it should be treated.
"These studies add to an increasing set of evidence regarding the safety of antidepressant administration during pregnancy," said in a press release John Thorp, deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence appears to show that the risks of untreated depression are greater than those raised by antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on motor development of children whose mothers treated themselves with SSRI, analyzing data of 51 404 children from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, researching the effects of using SSRI for motor skill development at the age of 3.
Researchers discovered that 381 mothers had used SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of them were treated with drugs for a prolonged period.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in motor development, researchers wrote in the study that the association "was not so significant as to attach clinical importance to the delay".
A group of researchers at Adelaide University in Australia conducted a data examination for 49,000 women in the Danish National Birth Cohort to discover the effects of SSRI administration on children's behaviour by the age of 7.
The study found that untreated depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioral problems.
In 210 children whose mothers had been treated against depression with SSRI there was no increased risk of behavioral problems compared to the 231 children who were more prone to behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and social problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also discovered in a separate study, that mothers are more prone to bleeding after birth if treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who gave birth at an Adelaide university hospital between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal haemorrhage increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers have said that although the study linked the administration of SSRIs at increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information the researchers had about specific medical conditions of women - that could have had an effect on bleeding potential.
"Women who have taken antidepressants at an advanced stage of pregnancy may have been those with the worst stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal haemorrhage, not antidepressants," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, a professor at Adelaide University.
On the basis of this study alone, we do not recommend that women stop their drug treatment against depression during pregnancy, but be closely monitored to reduce as much as possible the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in the murder of Virginia Technical University student
The man charged with the murder of Virginia University student Hannah Graham was indicted for qualified murder in the case of a missing Virginia Technical University student in 2009, authorities announced Tuesday.
The grand jury in Albemarle, Virginia, indicted 33-year-old Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. from Charlottesville on Friday for the murder of Morgan Harrington, officials say.
Matthew is also charged with kidnapping with intent to rape.
Each charge is given the maximum life sentence.
20-year-old Harrington disappeared from a Charlottesville concert in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the impeachment brought them relief.
"For six years we have been working determinedly and unabated for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm delighted to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for your act.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to be set.
Police say there is a forensic link between the Harrington, Graham cases and a 2005 sexual abuse in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of the latter and awaits sentence in the case.
He stays in jail in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew charged with murder in the death of a student at Virginia University
Harrington had gone to U-Va. on October 17, 2009, with friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington exited the John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and was unable to get back in.
She was last seen attempting to take a taxi around 8:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was wearing a black Pantera T-shirt.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and cell phone were found in the arena parking lot.
Family and friends began an extensive search for Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he was wearing was found near a string of apartments in Charlottesville.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated field, on a farm southwest of Charlottesville.
During Harrington's disappearance, Matthew had worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it is unclear whether that period overlapped with the date Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were related by DNA evidence.
Investigators have not yet released the details of the new evidence that led them to charge Matthew with Harrington's murder.
Defense attorney Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in the Graham case, refused to give statements.
The indictment announcement comes two days after the one-year anniversary of Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they had gone out in Charlottesville.
18-year-old Graham, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a downtown mall near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a nationwide search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for murder in Graham's case.
In the early days after Graham's disappearance last fall in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at rallies and wakes held for the missing student at U-Va.
Harrington says she endured for her daughter speculation and criticism in the media that must be silenced by the new charges against Matthew.
"All this time there was also talk like "Why was he wearing a short skirt?" and "He was asking himself for it?" but this kind of questions and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we are dealing with a predator on the heels of the hunt," Harrington added.
In the Fairfax County case, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault against a young woman in 2005.
The woman, who at the time of the attack was 26 years old, told the jurors that, one September evening, while returning home on foot from the store, a stranger came behind her.
He took her to a green zone, beat her and strangled her, then sexually attacked her.
"I thought it was the end of me, that I had to scream incessantly," the woman confessed.
I was afraid I was going to die.
Matthew suddenly ran away, the woman also said.
A prosecutor told the jurors that Matthew may have been scared of the headlights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was convicted years later, after DNA tests linked him to the case.
Matthew will receive his sentence in October.
Matthew will first come to trial in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said he would most likely come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least, today we took another step," says Dan Harrington.
Is Jon Snow dead or not?
Actor Kit Harington gives us a clue
Actor Kit Harington gave an important clue about the fate of his character in the series Games of Thrones, Jon Snow, who was killed at the end of season four.
In an interview with the Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knew the duration of his contract with HBO, according to Digital Spy.
Asked how many more seasons he would appear, he said he could not talk about this topic.
Let's just say the show will be part of my life for a while, I'll probably be in my 30s when it's over.
But one thing's for sure.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then it will be the moment when I will bury myself in projects with feature films," the actor said.
The series returns to small screens next spring.
The fans of Games of Thrones triggered a hysteria after the end of season four, when the character Jon Snow was stabbed and released various theories, according to which he will somehow be brought back to life.
Moreover, the Romans created an event on Facebook, called Jon Snow's Alms, 40 days after the season ended, which gathered over 36,000 supporters.
Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to resume payments for Romania under the programmes "Economic Competitiveness" and "Environment", both discontinued in early April 2015.
According to a communication from the Romanian Representative of the European Commission, following this decision, about 120 million euros will be transferred to the Romanian authorities in the next period.
I am happy to announce the unblocking of these payments and I appreciate the efforts made by the Romanian authorities to improve the management and control systems within the two programmes.
It is important that the Romanian authorities were involved in identifying weaknesses and solving problems.
"I express my hope that the measures taken will significantly reduce the risk of errors and irregularities in the future," European Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cretu said.
"The extremist statements made by Mr. Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the head of Hungarian diplomacy reacted.
Peter Szijjarto asked the European Socialists to stop "the campaign of lies" against Hungary.
Referring to statements made by Harlem Desir, the French Secretary of State for European Affairs, regarding the fence built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European strategy on immigration", but insisted that national borders should be protected.
Romania wants to hit the rugby world
Romania's national rugby union is ready for a big surprise at the World Cup which will begin in the UK on Friday.
The Oaks set out to win two wins in Group D.
"We want two victories, with the teams of Canada and Italy," said Mihai Macovei, captain of Romania.
The national "tricolora" is part of Group D at the World Cup in England, along with France, Ireland, Canada and Italy.
Romania's first match since the 2015 World Cup edition will be played on 23 September, the opponent being France.
Refugee crisis: JHA without any solution
European Council President Donald Tusk announced that on Thursday he will take a decision on the possible convocation of a European Union summit on migration to Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann called for a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis next week.
In a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot manage the refugee crisis alone.
The head of the German executive expressed his support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls in the face of the massive influx of asylum seekers, noting that the measure aims to facilitate the registration of refugees.
In turn, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposal to redeploy refugees between member countries on the basis of mandatory quotas - has decided to hold an extraordinary EU summit.
The EU Ministers of the Interior, meeting in Brussels on Monday evening, failed to adopt the new proposal for emergency redistribution of 120,000 refugees among the EU Member States, presented by the European Commission on 9 September.
The first point of the plan, represented by the refugee emergency relocation mechanism, provides for the rapid redeployment of 54,000 refugees in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, controversial new cartoons
French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo again provokes controversy, after the publication of cartoons that mock the response of predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries affected by wars.
In its most recent issue, the publication has again attracted attention, as well as criticism on social networks, the Reuters agency writes.
One of the drawings depicts a heartbreaking image of Aylan Kurdi, the drowned Syrian boy, whose body reached one of the beaches in Turkey, after a failed attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a child in shorts and a T-shirt, face down on the sea shore, next to a billboard that offers two children's menus for the price of one.
"So close to succeeding," is the message accompanying the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a cartoonist who survived the attack at the editor's office in Paris in January, is accompanied by the message "Evidence that Europe is Christian".
The drawing shows a character like Jesus, who walks on water, while a smaller character wears short trousers with his legs up in the water, the first saying "Christians walk on water", takes the second "Muslim children drown".
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of speech, after being the target of an attack by Islamist militants in January, following repeated threats following the taunting of the prophet Muhammad.
A supermarket chain present in Romania, drastically fined in Russia
The French supermarket chain Auchan was fined over $370,000 by Russian officials, charged with food safety violations.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor, said the fines total more than 25 million rubles, or $372,000, reports the Associated Press agency, quoted by US News.
However, the reasons for these fines were not stated, and Auchan did not comment.
Also, the French supermarket chain is the target of the accusations of the Russian agency for agriculture, which claims that some meat products have been found to be infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come during a period of tension between France and Russia, on the issue of extending the sanctions of the European Union and France's decision to cancel an agreement on the supply of Mistral ships to Russia.
The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs reacted to the news that Hungary could build a metal fence on the border with our country.
The MAE shows that he was informed about this decision quickly and that this is not a politically correct gesture.
MAE shows, in a communiqué submitted to Newspapers.com, that he was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs of this intention shortly before being publicly announced.
In turn, the MAE informed in due time, urgently, the competent decision makers in Romania about this situation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considered that the lifting of a fence between two Member States of the European Union and which are strategic partners is not politically correct, in line with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian side, it is also stated in the communiqué.
Hungary plans to build a metal fence on a border segment with Romania, in the context of the immigrant crisis, Mediafax quoted Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto as saying Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary because traffickers of people transiting Serbia are changing their routes, there is a likelihood that they will go to Romania," the head of Hungarian diplomacy explained.
"The guard would start at the point of the Hungarian/Serbia/Romania border and continue for a reasonable distance if the migration pressure moved to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants crossing the Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to bypass the fence built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern end, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, foreign immigrants have discovered that they can bypass the fence through the area of Majdan/Radi (Serbia) - Beba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Hungarian government has allocated 22.2 billion forints (71.8m euros) for the construction of a controversial metal fence at the border with Serbia, for a distance of 175 kilometres, and for special centres needed to accommodate immigrants.
The initiative of the fence is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
There's no need, he'll stay there
The coffin with the inanimate body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor will not be deposited in the Romanian Senate, despite the desire expressed by the politician's widow.
According to a press release delivered Newspapers.com, the Senate Permanent Bureau on Tuesday discussed a request by Doina Vadim Tudor regarding the approval of the deposition of the inanimate body of former Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor in the Senate seat.
"From the receipt of this letter to the moment of analysis, in the Permanent Office, the body was already deposited at a place of worship and will remain there, the Permanent Office assessing that it no longer needs to be moved from there to the Romanian Senate," the Senate said.
PNL Senator Teodor Atanasiu claimed that this request "does not agree with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
Also, send Agerpres, the senators held a moment of silence in memory of the former PRM leader, at the proposal of UNPR Senator Serban Mihailescu.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died, Monday night, around 6:30 p.m.
The PRM president passed away at the Army's Emergency Cardiovascular Center.
The MEP will be buried on Thursday at 12:00 at Ghencea Cemetery, and will receive military honours.
Are refugees coming to Romania?
Mayors from the border localities, questioned about the accommodation places
Mayors from the border towns of Arad county are being questioned by the Police and the Border Police these days regarding the accommodation places for eventual refugees who could arrive in Romania, but also for gendarmes, if they will be mobilized at the border.
Aedilul Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this topic.
Discussions were also held with farmers in the area, who were asked to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
I've had discussions with border guards, national police and local police, but also with farmers in the area.
We all have to be more vigilant in the next period.
"We asked the farmers, who have work during this period on arable land, to be careful and report any movement," said the Aedile.
Immigrant crisis boils in Hungary: Armored and water cannons at the border
He, like other mayors in the Hungarian border area, said the police had asked for information on the accommodation available in case of a wave of refugees.
We've been asked how many people we can accommodate.
In our commune we have no refugee spaces.
We believe that such special centres should not even appear at the border, because they are harder to control here, migrants being tempted to flee, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to set up such centres in areas further away from the border," said the mayor of Iratosu, Papp Atila Iosif.
In turn, the mayor of Dorobanti, Vincentiu Almasi, said that he was asked both accommodation places for refugees and intervention forces, in case they were mobilized in the area.
The police asked if we could accommodate the gendarmes.
We could find places at the Cultural Home, but for refugees we have no possibility of lodging.
"We have been questioned before about the length of the border with Hungary, perhaps a plan of action is being worked out," Vincentiu Almasi said.
He added that to the local police station, "as of Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it has been permanently established".
"There is always a policeman at the post, and the locals know that they must inform if they notice any foreigners in the area," said the aedile.
The representatives of Pilu City Hall said they can accommodate up to a hundred people, at the Cultural Home, the information being provided to the police, at their request.
Also, the mayor of Curtici, Nicolae Aanitei, said that there are accommodation spaces in the former headquarters of the local public finances, but here are necessary facilities.
Also, a former Border Police barracks could be arranged to accommodate refugees.
Representatives of the Arad County Police Press Office did not provide a point of view regarding the questioning of mayors during this period, confirming only that "the patrol activities were intensified in the border localities of Arad County".
Commander of the Army Club announces radical measures against Becali's Star
Army Sports Club commander Colonel George Boroi announced a series of radical measures to be taken against Gigi Becali's Star.
Although the two sides have negotiated a reconciliation, Boroi claims that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historical track record of the "red-blues".
The team that won the Champions Cup is in recess for now.
"It's not a historic break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have the team, but things can change from next year," said Boroi at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announces that the lawsuit calling for damages from Becali's team will continue.
The period referred to by the ICCJ decision is clearly set.
We must recover the damage from FC Steaua, the team that used the brand Steaua without the permission of the owner - meaning CSA Steaua.
The continuity of the ward also appears very clearly, which was in fact permanent of the Army club.
"So the Steaua Bucharest football team, in one form or another, but in a legal form, must exist as a continuation of the performance she has so far in her track record," says George Boroi.
The Star of Becali and the Army Club have been in open war since the end of last year, when the supreme court ruled that it was the military who owned the Star.
Simona Halep injured at US Open: The first statement by the novelist
Simona Halep injured herself at the US Open, as even the world's second player admitted on Wednesday.
Number two WTA has revealed that it has suffered a muscle stretch, and is currently undergoing a specialized treatment.
I suffered a small stretch and do a treatment.
"I hope to recover as soon as possible," Halep said at a press conference.
Simona Halep has evolved in the last two matches at the US Open with a sizeable bandage over her left thigh, accusing muscle problems.
Immediately after returning to Romania, Constantinanca paid a visit to the sports medicine clinic with which he has been working for a long time.
After the specialized investigations, Simone was prescribed a treatment.
Halep would return to competitions next week, when he plays in China, at the Guangzhou tournament.
The region that is swarming with millionaires
The Asian-Pacific millionaires will form, this year, the group of the richest people in the world, thanks to the fortunes accumulated in China and India, shows a study published by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management on Wednesday.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated fortunes of Asian Pacific millionaires will exceed the total of $15,800 billion recorded in 2014, as well as the wealth of North American millionaires, who currently represent the richest people in the world, with a cumulative fortune of $16,200 billion, reports AFP.
The study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, referred to in the financial jargon High Net Worth Individuals, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, compared to 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are people who can invest at least a million dollars, without taking into account the value of real estate and other possessions.
"In the future, HNWI's fortune is expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, with most of the new fortunes to come from the emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," says the study by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management.
The report estimates that China and India account for almost 10% of HNWI's global wealth and are responsible for 17% of the global growth of new assets after 2006.
China, the world's second economy after the US, had 890,000 millionaires in 2014 with a cumulative wealth of $4,500 billion, up 17.5% and 19.3% respectively, compared to 2013.
In turn, India has the fastest pace of increasing the number of millionaires, 26.3%, to 198,000 people, while their cumulative wealth has increased by 28.2%, to $785 billion.
"Dorel" mounted the traffic light backwards
In Suceava, the workers mounted an upside down traffic light, so instead of being notified that they have to wait 4 seconds, the passers-by get the message "h", which they do not know how to decipher.
Don't worry, most people run a red light anyway, inform the truth.
Each one passes as he cuts his head off.
Two guys were about to get picked up by a car for running a red light.
"Road cops should be here, to help, until people get used to it," a woman said to the source quoted.
The traffic light was recently mounted in front of the Great Market in the center of Suceva, but passersby do not seem at all eager to take it into account, especially as the information received seems to be incomprehensible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of the 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" was doing his job properly and someone was responsible enough to give his ok for the completion of the work, then it would never have come to this absurd situation.
The head of the Street Administration and Road Systematization service at Suceava City Hall candidly admit that he was there when the traffic light started to work, but he didn't realize that anything was wrong.
We put them into use, but we didn't realize it was an error.
"I myself was there when they were put into service," Stefan Vasincu said, promising that the problem would be resolved in no time.
Thank God it can be fixed, because there are situations where "Dorel" has wreaked irreparable havoc.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Ruse gas pipeline, "Dorel" lost the drilling mill digging the tunnel under the Danube, it is not known where, probably underground, buried, anyway was not to be found, as Minister of Economy Mihai Tudose himself claimed.
Police put water cannons on immigrants.
At Hungary's main border with Serbia Hungarian border guards used water cannons and tear gas on Wednesday against immigrants.
Although Hungary closed the border with a barbed wire fence and introduced harsh measures against illegal immigrants, including arrest, at the Serbo-Hungarian border continued to gather refugees, writes The Guardian.
Water cannons were put into operation when immigrants managed to break through the barbed wire fence through the border crossing at Roszke.
The Hungarian police claim that the action of the guns was a measure of crowd control, throwing water bottles.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people were crying after the use of tear gas.
The Greek publication Enikos writes, at the same time, that two German companies refuse to deliver barbed wire to Hungary.
The country has already raised the fence at the border with Serbia and on Tuesday announced its intention to raise one at the border with Romania, the initiative strongly criticized in Bucharest.
German companies claim that barbed wire is very dangerous and causes cuts that can become infected.
It is used to secure prisons or military installations, but it should not be used against people seeking shelter, the companies say.
In parallel with the Hungarian border clashes, Croatia has mobilized to make buses available to immigrants to transport those who show up at the country's border with Serbia.
The Croatian Interior Ministry confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, of which 73 children, the ministry also said.
Tsipras on Greece's drama - why it agrees with the third agreement with the EU
The stated goal of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from even more austerity and fundamentally change its relationship with the EU leadership in Brussels.
Finally, leader Syriza made Greece part of a third loan agreement for the country, which involved even more years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, which is playing an interview with him.
Now, however, Tsipras is urging Greeks to recommit the prime minister's mandate in elections he claims will strengthen his political stance.
Our goal was to get an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the dismantling of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of debt restructuring for Greece remains open," the former Greek prime minister also said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be decried as a strict one.
"But we knew from the beginning that any compromise would have been concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
He believes that the financing part of the agreement represents a great success for the Greek government, showing that all the financial needs of the country are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says Greece "surely needs reforms", saying it must be started with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on August 27th, opening the way for early elections in September after seven stormy months at the head of the Athens Executive, during which a third rescue loan was approved for Greece.
He got a broken neck and first-degree burns after he exploded in front of his electronic cigarette.
A 23-year-old man in Georgia suffered first-degree burns, fracture to the neck and finger and a coin-sized hole in the palate, after an electronic cigarette he smoked exploded in his face.
James Lauria was taking a short break from smoking at the service, when the incident occurred following which he remained in intensive care for a week, writes The Daily Mail.
Lauria, who was connected to a breathing apparatus, also suffered burns to his hand and cornea and a front tooth got into his gum.
I was at work and things were calming down and I went out for a second, like I always do.
"Unthinkably, it exploded and I was on my way to the hospital in an ambulance, that's the last thing I remember," Lauria told me.
Six weeks after the accident, Lauria still cannot swallow solid food and follows a liquid diet while recovering at her parents' home.
The electronic cigarette that caused the man's injuries is in the custody of the authorities, conducting an investigation into the incident.

Star Trek actress in jail for undressing in front of children
Actress Jennifer Lien, known from Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, embodying Kes, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that took her to prison, where she had been since September 3 - bail being set at $2,500 - took place outside her house in Tennessee.
The star started arguing with a neighbor, Carey Smith, over one of his crying children, informs the Mirror.
At one point, during the dispute, the actress lifted her shirt, showing her bust, so that then, before entering the house, she would take off her pants as well.
When the police came, Jennifer refused to dress.
Moreover, it threatened to kill the cops and was forced to drive to the car.
This is not the first time the 41-year-old actress has had problems with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then guilty of assault.
Jennifer became Kes since 1995, and then appeared in American History X, a film in which Edward Norton also starred.
She quit acting in 2002, when her first child was born.
She is married to film writer and producer Phil Hwang.
They're being targeted by the Western machine gun.
Stop supporting terrorism!
Syrian President Bashar al Assad gave a rare interview to Russian media, in which he talks about refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorists and of "targeting" immigrants.
"The Westerner is crying for them and the West has been supporting terrorists since the beginning of the crisis, when he said this is a peaceful uprising," Assad said in an interview with Russia Today.
The leader in Damascus claims that his Western counterparts say the situation in Syria is terrorism like the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or the Syrian regime or the Syrian president".
As long as this propaganda follows, they will have more refugees.
So it is not about Europe not accepting them or embracing them as refugees, it is about not treating the cause.
If you're worried about them, stop supporting terrorists.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of the entire refugee issue," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued the accusations against Western states and regarding the treatment they show towards refugees.
It is as if the West is now crying for refugees with one eye and targeting them with a second-eyed machine gun, because those refugees actually left Syria because of terrorism, mainly because of terrorists and crimes and secondly because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and you have the destruction of infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so many people leave because of terrorism and because they want to make a living somewhere in this world," says Bashar al Assad.
"If we asked any Syrian today what he wanted, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and safety for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding that political forces, whether inside or outside the government, "should unite around what the Syrian people want."
Syria's president believes that dialogue in his country should continue "to reach a consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we defeat terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all forces to unite against terrorism, because it is how we, as Syrians, can achieve the political goals that we want through dialogue and political action," Bashar al Assad also said.
He also spoke of one of his country's allies, Russian President Vladimir Putin, claiming that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, he was transformed, from a friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, once again accusing the West of falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the coup in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a tsar.
He is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses the Opposition in Russia and who came to power by undemocratic means, despite being elected in democratic elections, and the West itself acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now they're not democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," the Damascus leader punctuated.
Last but not least, it included Russia on the list of friendly countries - and regional partners - with which Syria is ready to co-operate in the fight against terrorism, along with Iran and Iraq, "because it is facing the same kind of terrorism".
Instead, Bashar al Assad criticised Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said they "can't make a move without first co-ordination with the United States and other Western countries".
In addition, Syria's president accuses the United States-led "international coalition", which is fighting terrorism: "In fact, since this coalition began operating, the Islamic State has begun to expand."
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the field.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can't be with and against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will sting you - then we have no objection to cooperating with all these countries, given that it is a real and not false coalition that fights terrorism," the Damascus leader also said.
Autumn?
No way.
More than 30 degrees
The weather will be quite hot on Wednesday, especially in the western part of the country, where temperatures will pass 30 degrees.
Bucharest will register 26 degrees at noon.
Two degrees less will be on the coast, while 26 degrees will be announced in Brasov.
There will be another 21 degrees at Moeciu, 23 at Bran, 23 at Cold Creek, 20 at Predeal and 20 at Busteni.
A little warmer weather will be in the western part of the country, where mercury in thermometers will pass the 30-degree threshold.
31 degrees will be registered in Satu Mare, 29 in Zalau, 30 in Cluj Napoca, 31 in Oradea, 28 in Alba Iulia, 30 in Arad, Timisoara and Caransebes.

Map of the countries with the highest discounts and how Romania stands
The collapse of the oil quotation has caused heavy losses in the last year to workers in oil extraction, shareholders of energy companies and countries that depend heavily on this resource.
But there was also a positive effect: gasoline has come cheap.
A map compiled by Bloomberg shows that between October 2014 and July 2015, in almost all 76 countries considered, the price of fuel fell.
The most important discount on the pump is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, diesel is down 97%, so you can power 24 SUVs with less than a dollar.
On the opposite side is Saudi Arabia, where the price is held fixed by the state.
The cost of gas oil varies from country to country, depending on the refining conditions, changes in taxation, but also currency fluctuations.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price in each state into US dollars.
Situation in Romania
Bloomberg data shows that, in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (about 3.8 liters) was $5.49.
Thus, we ranked 27th among countries with the most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this top position.
Compared to the last quarter of 2014, gasoline also cheapened in Romans.
Then, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a price reduction of 10.6%.
However, the surrounding countries are even better off.

Germans plan immigrant fate in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel vowed Tuesday night that the federal government would provide additional support to 16 Federation states in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a nearly four-hour meeting with prime ministers from 16 federal states, Merkel said "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to cope with the large number of refugees," notes the DPA agency.
She added that the federal government would create 40,000 seats for initial arrivals as well as distribution centers.
"Such pivot points are needed," she stressed.
The whole country must provide a massive boost to cope with the crisis, Merkel added.
The prime ministers of the Länder asked for more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the federal ruling coalition more than a week ago.
Thuringia Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow of the Left Party called for a "at least double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
In turn, the Prime Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also businesses, unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also called for bureaucracy in the manipulation of refugees and migrants to be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed processing in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
The Prime Minister of Bavaria Horst Seehofer expressed similar sentiments.
Until now, Bavaria carries the heaviest burden, with most migrants arriving after crossing the Austrian border.
Seehofer, a powerful actor on the federal stage as head of the Christian-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, came into public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual open door policy at the beginning of the month, recalls the DPA.
Mircea Lucescu scandals after humiliating defeat with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a chariot of nerves at the end of the match with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetsk lost 0-4.
The Romanian coach appeared totally disturbed by the arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost because she was disadvantaged.
Before the game I said one thing, that I wanted to be respected.
Unfortunately, in matches with major teams in Europe we are always disadvantaged by arbitration.
They're two totally different manners.
We are awarded a yellow card immediately, while the top teams are not.
Besides, the first penalty was by no means!
The ball hit Darijo in the back without touching his hand.
A game of this level should not be influenced by arbitration.
"I regret that arbitration ruined the game," Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.
"Ma'am, what smells so bad in here"?
There were pieces of the cut-up husband
A crime of an unusual sadism horrified the inhabitants of Fair Beautiful and Roman.
Yesterday morning, in the early hours of the day, the marketers of Fair Frumos could see terrifying scenes near the main entrance to the square.
Near the three dumpsters, forensics "assembled" from pieces what appeared to be a man's body.
It was cut, but lacked head, internal organs and genitals.
In the end, it would turn out to be the body of a former officer, who had been cut down by his wife, a geography teacher.
The "Newspaper of Iași" talked to the taxi driver who helped the killer, without knowing it, to carry the sacks with the body torn apart.
Its stories make your hair spin.
The one who alerted the cops yesterday that a woman was carrying three bags that smelled awful, after pieces of the body had been found at the market, was a taxi driver from Fair Frumos.
As in American films, the man helped himself transport sacks filled with human pieces, which smelled heavy, but without knowing it, the killer being his client for a race.
The taxi driver told, exclusively for "The Newspaper of Iași", the shocking scenes he went through, helping unwittingly for a killer to hide the evidence.
He carried with his hands the sacks in which the body pieces of the husband of the geography teacher, which he had cut off.
She had come to Fair Charming to hide the evidence of the crime as far away from her home as possible from Roman.
Maybe he's got lambs.
I couldn't have known.
Nea Mihai, as he is known by his friends who practice taxiing in Târgu Frumos, became an overnight star in the small town where he lives.
It has seen American films throughout its life, but never thought he would ever get to be the very basis for discovering a sadistic crime, and see with his eyes pieces of corpses.
It recounts that, on Monday night to Tuesday, it usually awaited the arrival of coaches who regularly transit the town.
It was near the intersection of roads to Roman and to Pascani.
The cabbie tells that the killer woman noticed her in the rearview mirror, next to the bags with the body pieces supported by the indicator showing the nearby towns.
She came the night with the race of Massaro, from 1.30.
The coach left it ten metres from the pedestrian crossing from Pascani, just at the marker where it displays the mileage.
The sacks were resonated by the signpost.
After the coach left, I hit reverse ten yards, up to it.
I opened the trunk and, after putting in a bag, I asked, "Ma'am, what smells so bad in here?".
I saw she was an old woman, and I thought I'd help her.
I thought he was taking meat to the market, to the market, to the market, maybe he had lambs, I had no way of knowing.
I also thought maybe he wanted to stick someone with that smelly meat.
She was trying to pick up a bag by herself, and I rushed to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"She told me to take it to the big gate of the market, when I picked it up from the bus," she began to tell the story of Nea Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He completed that the woman said absolutely nothing, and as a result, he was no longer curious to ask her anything.
Until my destination, I didn't talk about it, because I was nervous that he put the car in my car.
And when he took the bags off the car, I noticed that it smells even worse.
She took the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I went two feet back to turn around, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car over and over to make the smell go away.
On the coach I didn't notice if it was helped by someone to lower the bags, because there were lights in the back and I didn't see well in the mirrors.
"There were two plastic bags and one raffie," the man completed.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, he says that curiosity has begun to devour him.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After he took his bags off, I went to the hospital, to City Hall, and when I came back, I looked in particular to check on the woman with the luggage.
She had meanwhile hauled her luggage behind the fence, where the trash cans inside the market are also.
Then I left again.
There was little commotion, as an Italy minibus and a coach arrived.
I saw how the woman went to their drivers to get in them, to disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take her, because they have international races, and they don't take passengers on occasions.
The woman was very nervous, she was walking over and over.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, out of curiosity, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee replied that he went and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I had seen her a while ago.
I looked for them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them it was suspicious.
"Then we went somewhere else, a race to Belcești," Nea Mihai filled in.
He also told us that the woman was nervous after leaving her luggage in the dumpsters.
To me, suspicion went away from the fact that the luggage was gone, and I was curious what he had done with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing there and pointed at me, telling her that I had warned her that she had a suspicious luggage.
Then the woman went to the dumpsters and showed them her luggage.
"I returned to the place where he hid the bags around 3 o'clock, when I gave statements to Police and prosecutors at the scene," the taxi driver concluded his account.
The German prosecutors, who are investigating the case, say that 64-year-old teacher Ana Zechariah was surprised by the cameras of a Roman gas station at 0.55, getting on with the three bags in the coach.
She arrived at Fair Charming at 1.30.
According to investigators, she would have killed the husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, then cut him in the house.
The man was named Gheorghe Zechariah, and was a retired officer.
On Sunday night, the woman placed the body pieces in two plastic bags, which she transported to the bus station, and hid them.
The other night, he transported another one, then decided which direction to go, and chose the bus Bucharest - Iasi.
Last night, prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid her husband's internal organs, nor her genitals.
The head, however, was found wrapped in newspapers and bags, in a closet in the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, prosecutors didn't find out from the woman who was the reason she killed her husband in so much cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the teacher will be psychologically expertized, and the body will be examined by forensic doctors, to formally determine the cause of death and possibly other relevant details.
The town hall took over the national roads within the municipality, after years ago they had been taken over by the Government, so that they could be paved with money from the national budget, in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the City Council (CL), and a Government decision must be applied.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a condition because this in the constitution gave the opinion for the General Banistic Ur Plan (PUG).
The town hall took over an 11 km network of roads.
In any event, a legislative amendment that was adopted in July 2015 required the municipality to take over the national roads transiting through the municipality.
No notice can be issued from National Roads if the law is not respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
National roads have passed into our administration since today.
"Of course, the government decision will have to be issued as a result of this decision of the City Council," said interim Mayor Mihai Chirica.
The national roads that tran zitate the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28th National Road beats Ias on the arteries: Păcurari Road, Munteni Street (la se mafor), Fire Mill, Silvestru Street, Silvestru Street, Nicolae Iorga Boulevard, Spring Boulevard, Chișinău Road, Ţutora Road to the exit from the municipality to Tomești - Albita.
The other national road, DN 24, includes Bucium Road, Socola Avenue (up to the traffic light), Bucium Street (up to Base 3), Chișinăuului Road, Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard, Rosetti Road and exit to Cârlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
Following the description of some of the "files" of Mircea Eliade's political sympathies of youth which, however condensed, exceed the size of a daily article and must be broadcast in the series, I think it is worth evoking the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most vehement counts used by the detractors of the great Romanian scientist.
A less humorous description would, I hope, be useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "antilegionary", would be appropriate to stir up in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Critically analyzing the various versions that spoke of Eliade's regimentation in the Legion through the "Axa" Nest and Radu Gyr, Florin Ţurcanu brings up, in the Mircea Eliade volume.
The prisoner of history (Bucharest, 2003), another hypothesis, which interests us to the highest degree in understanding the resumption of epistolary contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after having played Ceaușescu "the balcony scene" since August that year.
Based on documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the safety investigation, in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) as well as on a 1938 follow-up note, Florin Ţurcanu states that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in the so-called "legionary family" called Luminita, a group of "cubes" of intellectuals, especially writers, led by poet Radu Gyr".
How about the Luminita nest there is no verifiable data, those in exile considering the existence of this questionable "legionary family", what must be discussed is, after all, the context in which this information was recorded on file.
Leaving aside the SRI's surprising kindness to make available these secret files to Mr. Ţurcanu, it is more than obvious that, at the time, the aim of the pursuit of the Safety was "Commander" Radu Gyr, the mention of Eliade making himself, according to the note of March 21, 1938, in the context in which Armand Călinescu, the Minister of the Interior had been given the free hand to take all necessary measures so that King Charles could impose the Royal Dictatorship, suspending his parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of the Legionnairess who were beginning to enjoy unexpected popularity (The All for the Country Party had come out third in the 1937 elections).
Eliade's arrest was made as a result of this note, quoted by Ţurcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, framed in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets under Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a thin bureaucratic cover for the repression of 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes were made at once for the vast majority of legionaries or sympathizers active in the public space who had to be arrested, but who had to be linked to an important legionary leader.
Radu Gyr's ollograph statement mentioned above, given in custody, in February 1941, after the suppression of the legionary rebellion, only confirms retrospectively the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police, authoritarian regime.
It would have been interesting if Turcanu had provided more details about the content of file 573 cited.
Was that Eliade's file or Radu Gyr's?
Because anyway it has to be a file built on Safety documents, but then processed by Security to be used either against one or the other.
There is an equivocal here, as in the case of the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only someone who knows the composition of the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious foundation knows that he represents a preliminary stage, of proof, in which the one in question behaves as an active sympathizer, during the trial period of three years before becoming a "chamate" with proper acts.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as intellectual clubs or cenacles, sittings, discussion groups with peasants, youth or student organizations revolved around a nest, were his "family", were not the nest itself, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escape the unapproved lecturer making Eliade's "member" status (which can be plausible) understood and used ad letteram to designate political regiment in the nest.
Of course, the invocation of subtleties of interpretation of this kind cannot occult the public activity of supporting the Guard nor the clear sympathy for the Captain who animated Eliade from 1935-1940, whether in Nae Ionescu's wake or not.
The public support of a cause in which you believe does not necessarily mean, however, and the actual political regulation all the more so since, as a rule, intellectuals of this size preserve a type of superiority over activists as such and do not enter politics unless they are offered directly high privileges.
As far as I could form an opinion of Eliade's type of thinking at that time, when he was "the leader of the young generation," I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted hierarchical rigors from a legionary nest.
And Radu Gyr did not have the intellectual ascendant of Nae Ionescu, though!
Not to mention, only in passing, the fact that, in any legionary "directory", what comes first is anti-Semitic public activity as well as violence, both worthy of being stigmatized, but non-existent in the case of Eliade, until further evidence.
Regarding Eliade-Gyr correspondence between 1968 - 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic defender of Eliade, tries to sanction the claims of Florin Ţurcanu (albeit based on some archive documents, even if they were worth dissecting and contextualizing more seriously) with a questionable yet argument.
Mircea Handoca finds, in the volume Noi glosse on Mircea Eliade (Bucharest, 2006), that "no line in the correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains any allusion to this framing".
Nor could it have been in 1968, when, somewhat out of the communist prisons, Radu Gyr could not have risked any allusion in a letter which was obviously intercepted by censorship.
What I think he wanted to point out to Mircea Handoca is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful one, of admiration and affection without any doubt about the ascendancy of Eliade.
There is indeed no palest suggestion that, ever, Radu Gyr would have been Eliade's boss.
Cleverly, the poet forced to write at the Voice of the Fatherland, deplores from the first place his embarrassing condition by signaling to Eliade (who knew very precisely what mission the respective publication had been constantly dealing with the denigration of right-wing exile), in signature, after "your old friend", what to expect and is visibly relieved and happy when he responds affectionately to him after nearly three decades of separation since the "time craftsman" alienated them.
There is no doubt that, beyond the "mission" with which he had been commissioned (to convince Eliade that now, in the new Romania, he could come back at least quietly to see his mother and friends again) and which, skilfully, he fulfills dry and through short sentences, separated by paragraphs, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr only shows interest in literature.
No mention of esoteric innuendo, of refined political complications suggested or of any evocation of the years of youth in the register other than the cultural one.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior on the legionary line to Eliade, but until the consolidation of this version with less circumstantial evidence than those offered by Florin Turcanu, we have in this correspondents shards of memory who confess a mutual appreciation of characters who marked differently but steadfastly, our culture and who, beyond the dire attempts of life, find the tone of civilization and interwar education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, parables for the force of friendship and mutual respect beyond the "under the weather" destiny of authors.
In the early 1970s, Eliade finally renounces refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext of health problems and catastrophic floods in the country, announces the RSR authorities through the embassy (with which he carried a sporadic correspondence used to obtain passport for his sister), that he cannot follow the invitation to return to the country.
The result was predictable: it is again put at the index, it is mounted in Israel "the Toladot affair", the books sent to his family and friends (Fragments d'un journal, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, he never sees his mother again.
Of the friends in the country only with Noica still has a sporadic correspondence although, surprisingly, as the Chicago personal archive confirms, a lot of private persons or Romanian institutions still manage to send messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr didn't get permission to write to him after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceaușescu regime tried Eliade's second convincing operation (through official invitations, Noica's actions, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed into eternity.
New coach, foreign player
Due to the shortage of domestic volleyball players, Penicilina Iași tests on sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
Exit takes part in training tournaments under coach Dan Gavril
Retrograded in the first half of the year from the A1 Division of Women's Volleyball, Penicilina Iași retained her place in the first tier due to the withdrawal and then disbandment of the band Stiinta Miroslava, freshly promoted to the first tier following a disputed dam tour in the very commune of Iasi.
The news took a little unprepared management of the Iași group, who found himself without a head coach (after the departure of Rareș Puni, arrived second in Bacău Science) and many missing players, some retired like Cristina Lungu and the Liberto Diana Studineanu, or gone, like Ana-Maria Berdila (at the champion of Volleyball Alba Blaj) and sisters Maria and Iuliana Fica.
Naturally, until the championship scheduled to resume on October 10, there was and there is still time to complete the squad.
First was found a new coach in the person of Dan Gavril, from the men's team LPS Piatra Neamt and who worked a little more in the last few years in Penicillina, he wet to sign a contract shortly with the group led by Vasile Left.
Then two players from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconita were brought in, and several foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland were tried, closer to the transfer being Serbian player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, Penicillina's squad led by Dan Gavril conducted a training camp at Gura Humorului, after which he participated in a tournament held in Lugoj and equipped with the Banat Cup, in which the Iasi women achieved a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but they also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, from September 23rd to 25th, Penicillina will participate in another tournament in Craiova.
For the new championship we're trying to make a valuable team.
We have a skilled and experienced coach, but the Romanian player fund is quite small and that is why we will also turn to volleyball players from abroad, especially after the decision has been made that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young sports generation at clubs in Romania.
"We hope to reach the end of the competition year in 5-6th place, even if it will be very difficult," said Vasile Left, president of ACS Penicilina Iasi.
Exciting meeting.
Twins Reunited After Nearly 70 Years
Twins George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69, were born at the end of World War II, in Germany, after their Polish-born mother had just been released from a labor camp.
As she was too ill to care for them, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, with the two brothers thus being separated not only from the one who gave them life, but also from each other.
For decades George and Lucian didn't know about each other's existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered documents demonstrating that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the '60s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they found no trace to lead them to Lucian.
It was not until 2015, thanks to the Red Cross' "Restoring Family Links" program, that the twins met again, and the moment was more than touching.
BBC reporters surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iasi brought home from Stuttgart four medals at the sports dance
Two gold medals, one silver medal and one bronze medal were won by the Iași children at the German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sports dance competition organized by the German Sports Dance Federation and the World Sports Dance Federation.
From Iași there were five pairs who trained at the Dance Energy Club and who danced alongside 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children from Iasi participated in five different categories (juvenile 1, juvenile 2, junior 2, youth and amateurs).
Those who returned home with medals were the pairs: Răzvan Andrei Zechariah and Ana Maria Târzianu (two gold and one silver medals), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Ștefana Gologan (the bronze medal).
And three other pairs managed to take the top places: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Ioana Iosub Cujba and last but not least the pair Andrei Emilia and Raluca Elena Ionita.
As a coach I wanted enormously to reconfirm the results achieved in March of this year, this reconfirmation being necessary for both us as teachers and athletes in terms of their future evolution.
The fact that we were able to hear the Romanian anthem twice this year at the German Open and return home with four medals, gives us enormous joy and hope and confidence that we can raise both the club and its athletes to the highest level.
"All of this would only be achievable with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andreea Ramona Manolache, the children's coach at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs from the country, achieving a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country 4th out of the 20 participating countries.
It should be mentioned that of the nine medals, four came to Iasi.
6 Ways to Get Out of Stress in a Minute
Too few of us can afford to run a weekend in the mountains to relieve stress.
Some have our time, others have our finances, and others have both our impediments.
But there are solutions available to anyone who wants to get rid of a little stress.
They did not involve any high costs or special allocated time, according to lyla.ro.
Everyday worries are inevitable, but it is up to us how we deal with them and what attitude we take towards them.
Instead of grinding you inside and feeling an implosion taking place in your mind, you'd better try the following relaxation tactics that won't steal more than a minute.
Take a deep breath.
Breathing exercises are not just intended for soloists or yoga practitioners.
They work for any individual, and regulating breathing at a tense moment helps release endorphins into the body, a process that leads to a state of relaxation, informs Livestrong.
Be a baby
We know we're over the age of our childhood and we can't afford to endear ourselves when we feel like it.
But that doesn't mean we can't go to a corner of the office office or wherever we know we're alone (even behind the building) and not scream while our lungs hold.
You can get rid of the nerves and the negative energy accumulated during a day with a few loud screams.
Imagine a beautiful place
We know the recommendation sounds worthy of a line during a psychotherapy session, but it's not for nothing that psychologists use it often.
Imagining a beautiful place, which inspires calm and detachment from daily frenzy, can lead to attenuation of the state of nerves.
It is, indeed, self-suggestion, a process that can actually change lives, both for the better and for the worse.
It all depends on what we're suggesting.
It is best to think of an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to the music
Stick your headphones in your ears and listen to the music of relaxation.
Attention, it's not about your favorite music, because if it's about heavy metal you might have difficulty relaxing.
Listen to even relaxation songs, which are smooth and do not contain lyrics, to find your balance when your fuse is lit.
Peel off an orange
Does it sound weird advice to peel an orange to your nerves?
Well, it's not!
Because it is not the fruit itself, because it does not contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (occasionally, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange peel, during shelling, stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, hormone of the state of well-being.
Squeeze an animal
Those who have animals close by, whether it's the one at home, or it's the one who came around to work, take a few seconds to caress him.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, petting animals can lower blood pressure.
Hora and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with somewhat rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, canta Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces of Romanian folklore combining violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to musicians Cristian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is titled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar, writes hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found each other, and from that moment on we enjoyed singing together, having a virtually unlimited repertoire".
We thought this was the moment a violin met with a guitar.
Cristi: "From the first date we realized that what we sing is very good and that, from the point of view of the human component, things work".
Each of us learned from each other's repertoire and, what's very important, is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentin: "I know there is a chasm between classical music people and the rest".
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And secondly, we were stealing a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who only listen to classical music listen and rock, and those who only listen to rock get to like classical music.
And we had the surprise to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they would listen to something like this and they would love it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and we find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, we find it formidable".
Students from Iasi spent more time in traffic than at school on the first day after the holiday
Hundreds of Jesuits were "captive" yesterday morning in infernal traffic in several areas.
The town hall announced that today the Mangeron Avenue (splai Bahlui shore left) is closed between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roș.
The City Hall chiefs did not keep their promises to do some work to fluidize traffic with the onset of the school year.
One of the insurances the municipality has given, at least twice in the last few weeks, consisted of the re-establishment of the roundabout in the International Station area.
Although only a few provisional elements had to be fitted, and the last deadline for carrying out the work was the end of last week, yesterday the roundabout was not achieved.
Driver nerves were stretched to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another City Hall promise was broken as well: moving customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Technopolis "at the latest by the end of August", in the context that this transfer is being discussed as early as 2012.
Currently, interim Mayor Mihai Chirica says the problem at the International Station is more complicated.
Giracy will be made at the right time, we must take into account the traffic of trams in the area, we must also have an opinion from National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbru, where there's time for the tram to stay in the turn, but we'll sort it out in a way," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to him, would be to stop the tram with a traffic light before the turn.
Problems in circulation were also in the intersection of Podu Ros.
The car line on St. Lazarus Street stretched to the SRI headquarters.
"I waited good minutes to be able to go out to the Red Podu," said one Jeshan.
Through Podu Ros had to run trams to CUG in September, if the rehabilitation project "Development and rehabilitation of the South functional artery" was completed within the original execution deadline (July 31, 2015).
There are two projects that complete the original one.
"We attracted European funds for new works, for example over-expansion, on the original version of the Nicolina passage was narrow," Chirica commented.
The latest deadline for the reintroduction of tram traffic is October.
During yesterday, the Iași reported traffic problems especially in areas such as Pacurari, Centru (Targu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or the intersection in Base 3.
Adomniþei might return as chief at CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you will know for sure.
The judges of the Tribunal will decide tomorrow whether the suspended President of the County Council will be maintained judicial control and prohibitions.
The magistrates of the Iasi Court settled a new term yesterday in the case "Album", in which the defendant is also the suspended president of the Iasi County Council.
At the end of yesterday's hearing, the magistrates decided to rule over tomorrow on the measure of judicial review currently imposed against Adomniței.
The latter wishes in the habitation or revocation of this measure, the one that has kept him out of the CJ's chief seat for several months.
In case of a favourable solution, and if it is maintained by the higher court, Cristian Adomniței will be able to resume his office as President of the CJ.
Adomniței was sued by the National Antico ruption Directorate (DNA), accused of favouring the perpetrator and intellectual forgery after, I say pro curori, he attempted to mask an audit check following which a number of irregularities had been discovered regarding reception from a public contranct signed between CJ and Laser Co.
Adomniței would have tried to hide the fact that the institution he ran would not have received more materials to promote Iași County, although scripturally these materials would figure as being received by CJ.
Along with him, three CJ executives were brought to justice, as well as the administrator of Laser Co.
Another 3,500 people are expected to vote by September 25th.
The City Hall is prepared to distribute further questionnaires if the 12,000 will run out.
The people only have ten days to express their opinion on the replanting of the limes on the pedestrian Stefan cel Mare.
According to the municipality's officials, so far about 8,500 of the 12,000 questionnaires distributed at neighborhood centers and at three additional points in the city (Copou Park, Alexander the Good Esplanade and City Hall) have been completed.
A record number of Jesuits featured in front of City Hall on Sunday.
According to representatives of the civic group "Iasul loves limes", 530 people voted in 140 minutes and almost four votes cast each minute.
Instead, throughout Monday, about 440 Jeshans came to the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many outcasts advertise the inefficient signaling and sighting populations of the public consultation.
They therefore appealed yesterday to Internet users to print an information poster made available by the group and stick it in the block stairs.
The volunteers also showed that at the additional point in Copou Park the last forms were filled out by the Iesians on Sunday.
We'll offer forms from the neighborhood centers, where they don't really fill in.
"Eventually supplements we will do when all 12,000 forms are filled out," said yesterday municipality spokesman Sebastian Buraga.
"Scruti null linden" will end on September 25, and if the majority vote of the Iașins is in favour of replanting the trees then the Town Hall will plant silver lime this autumn.
The Ieşeni can express their opinion at the neighbourhood centers in Dacia, Frumoasa, Tatarasi, Nicolina and Parcurari, as well as at the additional points mentioned above.
The City Hall chiefs decided to cut the limes on Stephen the Great in early 2013, an action that attracted a fine of 60,000 lei to the municipality.
The decision was adopted unilaterally, without a consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous emergence of the civic group "Iasul Loves Limes", an online community comprising about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for the replanting of limes was signed by more than 9,100 supporters until yesterday evening.
RECORD of students registered at USAMV Iasi!
I'm 920 in the first year.
The university has 920 first-year students this year.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" have stated that this year there have been the most candidates ever admitted, in the history of the higher education institution, since its establishment.
We are very pleased with this year's results from admission.
We have the largest number of admitted candidates in the history of the university, almost 920 first-year students. We have never exceeded such a number.
"We also had candidates with higher backgrounds, we took our seats from budget to bachelor's and master's," said Prof.dr. Ioan Țenu, vice-rector in charge of teaching.
It also noted that the university also registered a considerable number of students at the fee, taking up 20% of those seats, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although the results of the study lines in Romanian have also been published, the admission still continues to the English-language study program at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which has taken out 50 places, where the fee is 5,000 euros, and now the Ministry expects a reply on the confirmation of student files and required study visas.
At the autumn session, a total of 120 files were submitted on the 14 budgeted seats and 209 were taken to the contest under "tax" in the bachelor's studies.
Most of the files were submitted to the Faculty of Agriculture, in number 75, in Horticulture were 23, and in Zootehnie, 22.
At the master's were submitted in the autumn session 18 files, on the 150 toll seats proposed by USAMV, seven of them at Agriculture, five at Horticulture and six at Zootehnie.
Drivers fear they'll drive their cars into the cracks on Tudor Vladimirescu Bridge
The bridge over Bahlui on Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard remained as riddled as when the "Iași Paper" wrote about the problems it presents, 10 days ago.
Reporters of our daily newspaper then signaled that on the axis that delineates the two meanings of walking the asphalt has dropped, defending deep pits, some even 20 centimetres, through which you can see the concrete slabs that represent the primary infrastructure of the bridge.
The asphalt also began to crack on both sides of the shaft, preting signs that the dents would accentuate.
At the time, the interim mayor Mihai Chirica mentioned that the bridge has no structural problems, having recently been made a technical expertise, with a view to starting a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tram track, worth 5 million euros.
Mayor Chirica noted that the area affected by cracks and pits would be signaled, with asphalt restoration work to be carried out quickly.
The only measures taken so far, however, have been the installation of pins and a signaling band, without even a simple filling.
During this period, we focused more on opening the school and the work needed for this purpose.
"A punctual expertise is underway for the bridge that we are expecting in about a week with the details needed for the intervention, I appreciate that within two weeks at most we could move on to remedy the situation," the interim mayor said.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stephen, started school.
The preparatory class, as he tries to improve the situation.
I don't know whether to enjoy or let myself be overwhelmed by melancholy; I am leaning, passively, towards the second variant.
First of all, because I get the feeling that it's only been three weeks, not three years since I took him to kindergarten for the first time, with emotions.
Although he breathes relievedly, no normal parent enjoys raising his children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day from my childhood; then began a story that, at the very least, did not end until today.
I wasn't even what's usually called a conscientious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But school always liked me.
So much so that I chose to continue to attend it, even if as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I wanted to do my whole life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And none with any stakes.
That is because, like all of us, I have come across all sorts of teachers: better or worse, nicer or unbearable, smarter or downright imbeciles.
It happens, unfortunately, that there are people with other calls in this guild.
I think they're toxic, because they hurt the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I was fortunate to give, while I was a student or student, over a few, few, exceptional teachers.
These meetings can be decisive if they are at the right time.
Who thinks that the role of the department is the banal transmission of some information is sadly mistaken.
That can be done by anyone; to be informed, one can inform the student very well on his own, that we are just living in the era of transparency.
A good teacher, however, shapes the minds of alumns.
It forms them, it creates their thinking.
Sitting in the chair is not a privilege, as many believe, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very picky, demanding, unforgiving and always willing to look for the flaws of those in front of them.
That's how their age dictates their temper.
As a teenager, we all thought we knew everything, that we had unwavering certainties about everything.
When we grow up, we come to understand that we have only doubts.
Therefore, the role of a teacher is to pull the teenager out of his categorical self-sufficiency and make him think.
That is, to learn to doubt, to ask questions.
To discover on their own the answers, be they provisional.
To get involved in everything he does.
Lead him discreetly to profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially since most of the time the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who can't wait to catch him on the wrong foot to sanction him.
However, this entitles him, the always misunderstood, rebellious, to live to the fullest of his age calls, to regard the one at the department with suspicion.
He can't just naturally accept his attempt to order it.
Teenagers do not allow themselves to be put in place, do not accept restrictions.
Or if they give the impression they're doing it, they're getting revenge somehow.
And unfortunately, when there is a rigid person in the department, who imposes himself by hardness and does not communicate, the students take their revenge on the object taught.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with great writers, for example, because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a sequence of data, that mathematics are all that can be more exhausting to their unripe minds.
I always urge my students: if you come across a teacher you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate human to human with you, don't let him push you away from the literature to which he should direct you.
How did it happen that I became a teacher myself?
I had a really good teacher in grades VI-VIII.
He opened my mind to some texts that spoke to the puber then on his own understanding.
I met, in high school, a university professor who opened the door to his library.
I looked at him as a man from another world: he had the walls of the house covered with bookshelves.
I got lost in his library and dreamed of having one of those.
Now maybe I have it, but if fate hadn't gotten in my way, maybe I'd have decided to become a football player.
Or an engineer or a lawyer or something.
I don't think meetings like this are random.
I don't believe in chance.
The main thing is to run into the man who takes your hand and patiently directs you to your own vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the teacher.
Now, my experience only helps me talk about what it means to teach literature.
It's just that literature can't be taught.
There is no teacher of literature, as there is a teacher of mathematics.
How to fix the ineffable in concepts?
You can, at most, approximate it, without the claim that you convey petrified truths.
The one in the department can at best guide reading, that's something else.
But it can especially occasion miraculous encounters between a reader and books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open his mind, that can lift someone's words, the scales on his eyes.
That is why the literature teacher must, first of all, manage to make his students understand (feel) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great coseur, Al. Paleologu, said one thing only apparently paradoxical: "How much literature, so much life, not the other way around!" and was right.
That is why a good teacher prepares you for life, does not make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Fortunately, we always have to learn something.
And we, the teachers; or especially we, the teachers.
Most of the time, a great truth is repeated only out of inertia: not only do the disciples learn from their masters, but also the other way around.
Ideally, the teacher should be a master, and the student an apprentice.
Who, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own path.
Few find him, that's right.
But it was the master who ignited the spark.
I do not believe that there is greater happiness for a pure blood teacher than that of enduring as many such breakups as possible.

Expanding investigation to FIFA
Justice in the US and Switzerland will proceed to new arrests
US and Swiss authorities have announced they will start prosecutions of new people and organisations as part of the FIFA corruption investigation, international media reports.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced in a press conference in Zurich on Monday that the area of investigations into corruption in world football had been widened.
"On the basis of our co-operation and on the basis of new evidence, we will commit further criminal prosecutions against new individuals and new organisations," Lynch said.
In May, several FIFA senior officials were arrested in Switzerland in this corruption case.
Many of them have already been extradited to the US.
"We have hopes that other people prosecuted will reach the US as well," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General Michael Lauber, also present at the press conference, said his institution had seized several goods, including housing and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, as part of the investigation conducted in collaboration with the US.
"We haven't reached the end of the first half either," Lauber said.
So far, a very large amount of information has been seized, 11 terrabytes.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
A contract to cede media rights to investigators also came to the 2010 World Cups in South Africa and in 2014 - Brazil.
FIFA faces a big corruption scandal, after US justice indicted 14 people, including two FIFA vice presidents and seven forum officials.
Detained persons are being investigated for bribery and receiving other benefits, from the early 1990s until now, totaling over $150 million.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced, in early July, that he was resigning as FIFA president, after being re-elected for the fifth time.
Fight like a movie at the theater
In the Supekombat gala in Milan, Iașin Cătălin Morosanu will fight the "beast" James Wilson
A number of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Cătălin Moroșanu, will participate, on October 2, in the Superkombat gala at the Linear 4 Ciak theatre in Milan, the last one ahead of the November final, says a press release delivered by MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by last year's atmosphere, and as promised, we will be back this autumn with a new five-star gala.
Since we have chosen a unique venue, a theatre, then we promise beating like in the movies.
We will have eight Romanian fighters in the program of the event.
In addition to the matches with the already established stars, we will have another gala opening, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including Romanians Cristi Spetcu, Cristian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"The full schedule will soon be announced as well," said promoter Eduard Irimia.
Cătălin Moroșanu will fight in the Superkombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination gala with American James Wilson, known after participating in the last heavyweight pyramid held in Japan in 2012 and the numerous awards from the bodybuilding concusses.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I've seen Wilson, he's a beast indeed, but I'm demolishing him!
I'm still upset that last year I couldn't fight in the finals, so now I'm gonna take it out on him.
"From the beast I turn him into a kitten," said Morosanu.
Undefeated in 2015, brothers Andrei and Bogdan Stoica will have their last confrontations in Italy before fighting for the world titles on 7 November in the grand final.
Last year, they both knocked themselves out in Italy, and now they promise to repeat the script.
I'm happy to be back in Italy, last year's atmosphere was incredible.
"I can't wait to meet the fans there again and I promise them a new show to remember," said world champion Andrei Stoica.
In Milan he will also fight Raul Catinas with an opponent to be established.
A little girl invited the Queen of England to her birthday, but she also scolded her in the letter
A little girl from Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to attend her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen on her longest reign, but she did not forget to mention that she was not allowed into Buckingham Palace when she went to visit him with her family.
The letter did not run out of echo, but the little girl received a reply from representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for the invitation, but also apologized that she would not be able to be present on September 27, and even wished her to have fun with her family and friends.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Paunescu were invited together to a talk show shortly before the poet Adrian Paunescu died.
Both writers died of a heart attack.
The destiny of Adrian Paunescu and that of Vadim Tudor is similar.
Both were writers and politicians and both died at close ages, of heart.
Adrian Păunescu at 67, Vadim Tudor at 65.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died, on a reality TV show.
Full of verva, Vadim Tudor taunted Gheorghe Flutur and criticized Elena Udrea, Minister of Tourism at the time, for the Romanian tourism situation.
At one point Vadim Tudor said, with a smile on his jokes, to Adrian Paunescu: "I am envious of your posthumous glory, Adrian".
Paunescu, smiling too, answered him then, "It's not very commendative what you just said to me".
Adrian Păunescu died on November 5, 2010, at the age of 67.
Corneliu Vadim Tudor died today, September 14, 2015, at the age of 65.
Two ICONSCIOUS PEOPLE AFTER AN ACCIDENT AT DUMBRAVA
An accident occurred on Monday evening at around 19:00 in Dumbrava in Iași County.
A cyclist was picked up by a Volkswagen car.
The cyclist was not noticed by the driver.
Fortunately, they're both in stable condition.
Following the impact, the windshield and the car mirror were broken.
Two injured people are unconscious at the time of transmission of this news.
A SMURD crew is on their way to provide medical care to the victims and transport them to the hospital.
Cops are on the scene.
A Syrian artist turned "Super Mario" into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a refugee version of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the plight of his compatriots, on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of Italian plumber Mario in the Kingdom of Mushrooms, the modified video game has "Mario Refugee" at its center.
The character tries to get past human traffickers and border police, on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The Istanbul-based artist uses the pseudonym Samir al-Mufti for security reasons and said he made the video game with refugee Mario after his friends ventured on a dangerous trip to Europe, to escape the horrors of war.
At Craiova Detention Center the youngest student is 15 years old and is in the first class
Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said, at the opening of the school year at Craiova Detention Center, that the youngest student is 15 years old and is in the first grade, and the oldest one is 25 years old and is in the 11th grade, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a center belonging to the National Administration of Prisons to try to draw attention, and in this way, to lesser known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in the first grade, and the oldest is 25 years old and is enrolled in the 11th grade.
"There are complicated topics that society is concerned about debating at the moment, we are all pressed by our own worries and problems, but we must not overlook the lesson that these more than 100 young people from Craiova Detention Center offer," Minister Robert Cazanciuc said at the opening ceremony of the school year on Monday.
The Minister of Justice pointed out that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material possibilities, can lead to tragedies, stating that the young people in this centre would have had another chance in life if they could have followed the natural school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, to read, but also to receive a set of moral values, to find out what compliance with the law means and what consequences it may have.
"The role of the prison system is not to permanently isolate from society people who have broken the law, to close them behind high walls, but to try to re-educate them and prepare them, so that when they return to the community they have more chances of reintegration," Cazanciuc added.
The minister noted that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because in many cases the conditions of detention are borderline to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about the reintegration of convicted persons.
We collaborate very well with the Ministry of Education and thanks to this partnership, every year, in the prison system, there are over 2000 graduates of the school education courses.
Obviously, we will not be able to change overnight that has not been done for 25 years, but these are important steps that we are taking.
"In all these actions we also need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we are doing our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and are not a danger to society," said Cazanciuc.
The Minister of Justice wished both students and educators success, showing that success comes only through the conjugated effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Ascension of the Holy Cross, I would launch to all students and teachers the invitation to visit the mausoleums of Soveja, Marăşti and beyond, in order to understand what the struggle of young people for ideals means," said Robert Cazanciuc.
A Russian came to vote with the bear
Doctoral schools caught with two plagiarisms to be abolished!
Petition of prestigious universities from Iasi and the country
More than 200 researchers, academics, personalities and students from the country have signed a petition launched by the Academic Society of Romania in which they request the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even abolish doctoral schools in Romania "which allow and promote academic imposture".
Signers of the petition launched on September 10 include teachers and teachers from Iași.
Among the university signatories of the petition in the Iași academic environment is, for example, Prof.Dr. Liviu Antonesei.
At the national level, the petition has names from former Education Ministers, such as Mircea Miclea, to people of culture who are also academic staff, such as Andrei Pleşu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Education Act provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, thus prompting the lack of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that blatantly violate ethical norms in scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognized performance," the petition reads.
The petition specifically requires compliance with the Law of National Education, evaluation of doctoral schools, suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school where more than two plagiarisms have been found, until the assessment and remedy of the situation.
The last requirement is the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school where there is no minimum number of doctoral leaders provided by law meeting the criteria imposed by the National Council of Scientific Research in 2011 for eligibility to IDEI-type project grants.
Do you respect less a general without a doctorate, or a politician, or an intelligence agent in the Middle East?
"Why don't there be other academies in Europe that give PhDs organized by secret services, and top military people who give their doctorate do it at autonomous academic institutions, where quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, initiator of the petition, also originating in Iasi.
This can be completed by all the wishers on the Society's website, and the final signatures will be submitted by the organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 who want to get involved.
The party "For Iași", founded by young IT managers who are politically unrelated, was launched in Copou Park the other day.
The chairman of the Initiative Group "For Iași" gave an interview to "The Newspaper of Iași"
Iasi will have a party dedicated exclusively to the development of the city.
A group of politically independent entrepreneurs and managers to date launched the Party For Iași last week which will propose candidates for the 2016 local elections.
Currently, the core of the party consists of IT specialists, but the initiators of the formation say that in the organization are welcome all the people who want to get involved in the modernization of the city.
The launch took place on Saturday, in Copou Park, and more than 200 sympathizers attended the event, almost all of whom were young.
The special guest of the action was Nicuşor Dan, president of the Save Bucharest Association.
He was the surprise of the 2012 local elections, when, from the position of independent, he managed to gather 10% of the votes of Bucharesters for the position of mayor of the Capital.
"The people I saw at 'For Iași' think they are very good for accessing the public administration of Iași".
I believe in this initiative, I think it has chances, I think it has perhaps more chances in a community smaller than in Bucharest.
"I will always be with "For Iași," said Nicuşor Dan.
ZDI: Why didn’t you leave Iasi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are rather sentimental and emotional.
I was away on many short business trips, I also lived a year in Cluj.
I came back every time, because I felt this was my home.
ZDI: Why have you now decided to set up a political party?
Andrei Postolache:Now we have reached a certain maturity, we are a group of people who have started to know each other for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we got more shy, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various edilitional or charitable actions, and somehow things evolved naturally and organically and now happened to be the moment when we came to the decision that we had to get more involved than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to make the activity of local public administration more efficient!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum computerization of the activity of the city hall so that the different departments, institutions and kings can work together as best as possible.
But more importantly, to be able to publish transparent data about the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about information organization.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular neighborhood, it is important to consult the public of the people affected.
If we are talking about efficiency, we must not forget public transport, we have the worst buses in the country.
New means of transport must be bought.
ZDI: Nowadays, the image of a city matters extremely much.
How would you promote the coward?
Andrei Postolache:Get on the plane and look for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industry events where you can sell the city.
You have to want to do this and know how to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and we brought customers to Iasi.
ZDI: What is the brand of Coward?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we must be a city of technology, one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, go into medicine, get into the robotics area, into the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and unite such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I mean here the modern brand of the city.
Of course, Iasi already has a historical brand that should not be changed, namely by the cultural city.
I see the two elements in the balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures with which elections are still won in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organization, planning, communication, working with people and running projects.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we will talk to everyone, we will not just stay on Facebook, we are not an online party.
We don't want to have "volunteer" brought in by bus.
That means we rely on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think there are enough people like that.
ZDI: Should the Mayor of Iasi be more concerned with promoting the image of the city nationally and internationally, or should the area of concerns be of an edilitarian nature at all times?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First you have to solve problems today, emergencies.
Or, if you don't make your city known, if you don't draw money into the city, at some point you run out of money and you won't be able to make streets, for example.
They must both be done at the same time and they must be competent people next to you.
The mayor doesn't have to do everything.
We have to give up the mayor-father model, which comes and punches the table and solves everything.
No.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract to the party IT area businessmen who can financially support the party?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, to have an unstained reputation, to be clearly integrity and to be honorable.
From that point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000, who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015 he started the company Introspecials, after, for seven years, he was director within the international concern Endava (2008 - 2015), where he coordinated a 300-man team.
Another four years (2003 - 2007) he spent at Synygy.
The company he set up alongside another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
Tractor Waste proved a failure
SC IRUM SA Reghin's Director General Mircea Oltean said that the National Tractor and Agricultural Car Park Renewal Stimulation Program, initiated in 2011, also called the Tractor Rabla, was a failure due to red tape.
Regarding the Rabla Program, there have been some attempts in recent years, but it turned out to have been a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a common farmer, and the approvals were far too long and then the world gave up.
Through that program it was able to sell somewhere at 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltean said.
According to him, IRUM Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred tractors annually, being the largest in Romania, and that the great competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
There is great competition with those who come from outside, all the world producers have set their sights on Romania, know these things that I have told you, and have special policies.
"At all the fairs there is a great crowd, all the producers exhibit, come entirely the kinds of variants," Mircea Oltean stressed, who said that IRUM Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forest tractors annually.
Through the Rabla tractor program, initiated in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled means, such as combinations, could hand them over and receive a 17,000 lei voucher instead.
The red flag has risen
Labour's internal survey seems more spectacular and politically significant, as the newly elected leader automatically becomes its spearhead in the upcoming election.
Raise, therefore, the red-lit flag/ Beneath its folds we will live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn sang in the London Sanctuary House pub yesterday.
He has testified to many facts and vows/ Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this unofficial anthem of the British and international left (Red Flag/ The Red Flag) can search it on the internet and would not be excluded from having a surprise.
With our heads uncovered, let's all swear/ That we'll wear it until we crash.
The author of these lines is not at all an admirer of red flags (and neither of those who wave them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn succeeds in joining yesterday's left with tomorrow's, this love story between him and the Labour Party base will have a happy-end.
I do not believe that this will happen, but I find it premature to talk about the great and inevitable election defeat, five years from now, of an elected leader the other day.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have seen a democratic exercise of an impressive scale.
British Labour did not invent the system of direct voting for the party leader, among the Western left.
The French Socialists have been practicing for several years a more complicated, motion-based system that allows for the expression of all members and sympathizers; in addition, they have held a preliminary competition for the nomination of the presidential candidate since 2012.
However, the internal Labour vote seems more spectacular and politically significant, as the newly elected leader automatically becomes its spearhead in the upcoming elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, with the customization of power being more pronounced in Britain than on the other side of the English Channel.
In addition, turnout was high in all three "circles": members themselves, members of unions and other organizations affiliated with the party and, finally, the group of sympathizers (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This last group gives us interesting information about the perceptions of left-wing segments in British society, especially those made up of young or middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to become even more involved, in the future, precisely because of the signal provided by Corbyn's victory.
There are, as far as I know, no sociological inquiries that tell us too much about the attitudes of this "outer circle" Labour, so cautious speculation is allowed.
I think we are seeing enough attitudes similar to those of Podemos sympathizers (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will go through the traditional channels of the left.
If we want to identify an "antisystem" vocation, it is reflected primarily by the rejection of the centrist line, New Labour (for many, only a disguised form of the much-hulled thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of leaders deemed guilty of the two successive election failures, one argument being that they did not go enough to the left, that they did not firmly delineate from the Tony Blair era.
The second landmark - after me, and more suggestively - is offered by the recent referendum on Scotland's independence.
If we abstract the separatist message and focus strictly on aspirations on other political topics, we see how Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments favorable to the social state and animated by the aspiration of equity, adept at disarmament and hostile to military involvement abroad, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance for poor countries.
Scottish Labour thus lost an electorate to which they should have, at least in principle, had privileged access, but which they can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn's campaign).
Such energies exist all over the United Kingdom, but the old leadership has not been able to attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his vocation as an outsider, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the Labour "aristocrat".
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the one with the anti-system left in the southern periphery of Europe.
The term "antisystem" is too harsh: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we will know more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps, as leader of the opposition.
We will see if the Red Flag will also ring in the House of Commons (it would not be the first time), after the new leader has taken his seat, primarily of the opposition banks.
However, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is primarily unity - and in this regard he does have reason to be concerned.
Handling trap with or without knowledge
While writing the article it occurred to me to check the online story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became in the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his person "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categorizations - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could itself make me from the beginning circumspect).
I didn't.
In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") we commented in parallel two pictures - the one with little Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean shore and the one, in fact: the two depicting Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second time as a refugee.
The story of Laith Al-Saleh was taken from the article "Syrian Fighters Come with the Wave of Refugees" (signed by Viorica Marin in The Truth of 3 September).
Monday night, I posted a link to my article on my Facebook page.
On Tuesday, going on Facebook, I found, among other things, a sleeve pull from the friend (not just the FB) Marius Cristian: "I subscribe, only a statement. Laith al Saleh is not a jihadist".
On the contrary, he's a fighter against Al Assad, for democracy and all that.
"So you could have added rude manipulation to the painting"!
I have to admit, I felt terrible.
All the more so as I wrote the article it occurred to me to check on the net the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became in the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his person "jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in itself make me circumspect).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
On the spot, I had no further comment on Marius Cristian's sleeve pull than that: "That's what I need if I trusted the Truth"
After that, I obviously took the story for small money and I feel indebted to readers with the correct presentation of the story of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh.
The oldest I found in an Associated Press (Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe - Syrian rebel leader seeks Europe) material signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett from 17 August 2015 on the island of Kos in Greece, where thousands of refugees, perhaps, noticed a man trying to tidy up in the chaos of the crowd, among the hundreds.
The man was Syrian stucco Laith Al Saleh of Aleppo who "is accustomed to being in command", since he "led a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria".
We also learn that Al Saleh, 30, had had "a home, a wife and a normal life before the fight that cost more than 250,000 lives and put a third of Syria's population on the road".
In the interview with Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh tells that "everyone wants to leave Syria".
My city is the most dangerous city in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me - I fought against everyone.
Beyond being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "an even more sinister encounter - with a man in whom he recognized a Syrian enemy": "Two days ago, I saw a sniper from government forces".
I haven't talked to him, but I'm still very upset.
From the material we also learn that Laith (which means lion in Arabic) was, indeed, on his way to Holland, where he has a cousin - former senior officer in the Syrian army and then he too became a rebel and arrived in the West after being seriously wounded - hoping to obtain asylum and then be able to bring his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly at an age with the civil war in Syria, which broke out in March 2011).
After this had succeeded, Laith Al-Saleh would not have ruled out a return to Syria to continue the fight for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by the Russians), the Islamic State and the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front.
Madness - whoever wants freedom must fight in Syria against not one enemy but three!
I also came across a Serbian material from 22 August, of which I didn't understand much, except that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come with migrants: TERRORISTI SE KRIJU MEĐU MIGRANTIMA sounds the title of a newscast on http://www.telegraf.rs/vesti, in which a picture of Al Saleh with a beard holding a Syrian flag and that of a refugee in which he wears the "THANK YOU" shirt.
On 7 September, then, himself on the BBC website, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of manipulation with the help of pictures of the Syrian fighter: This viral photo falsely claims to show an IS fighter posing as a refugee - This viral picture misrepresents a fighter of the Islamic State posing as a refugee.
We find out that the picture (in fact: the pictures - the one with the beard and the gun and the one with the THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would also have apologized in the meantime.
Only before that, just off his wall, the picture of the two pictures would have been shapped over 70,000 times, gathering several thousand comments.
That talk, too late, the horse was gone!
In Romania, on 9 September Carla Dinu of Hotnews takes over the story of manipulation on the BBC, but mistranslating the title: "A fake photo turned viral shows an ISIS fighter posing as a refugee".
Obviously, it's not the photo that's fake, it's the interpretation that was false, wrong, in short: manipulative.
