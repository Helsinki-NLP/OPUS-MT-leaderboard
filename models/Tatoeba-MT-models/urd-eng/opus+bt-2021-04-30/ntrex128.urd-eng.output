The star game's star-based career is intended for new career in the tournament industry.
The star of the game is ready to move to the host's host industry, and it has been discovered as part of the director of a license-based license company.
The 56-year-old star plays a role in Jack Besssis in the famous BC show, which they write and offer with long-time-time work Club.
Both have announced that the next nineth series will be the last series of show and that Karen is planning to leave forever.

The acters have refused to comment on news, although the media's sources have said that Karen McGan's ‘are engaged in the commercial trade'.
‘ The sea is ours, ’ expects to open the way to the Mediterranean from the Court of Bolivia to the Pacific.
The cell is moving around the genus of the navy of the Navy.
The public buildings have been a blue blue medal album on government buildings.
It is written on the Seas of the Seas from Lake Lake Tour: "Our right on the sea is on the sea".
"It's our duty to take it back".
The house is still a fresh memory of losing the coast of Chile in the 19th district in the late 19th Bolivia at the end of the year - and the desire to travel to the Mediterranean.
Now that desire is now at its highest level in several decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the international Court on 1 October 1.
The village's capital, the village of Bolivia, said that Bolivia has power, unity, and influence, and the result of a positive view.
Many of Bolivia's cities will see the decision of UK on large screens across the country, with the hope that in the hope that the claim to the claim of the McGan Bolivias Bolivia would have to be responsible for the state of Chile after several decades of poverty to the sea.
President, president of Bolivia's technical personality, has also had a considerable effort to make a Monday decision.
He was determined in August that his country was very close to returning to the Pacific.
But some reviews think that the court will not judge Bolivia's right - and if it does, it won't make a big change.
The United Nations Court of the United Nations has no authority to hand them, and he has claimed that he won't determine the result of possible policies.
In the international law, a genusist Lasa said, the fact that the decision of the OSJ is being given only six months later after the death of the last J.J.J. shows that the case was not an genus's 's'.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's goal, it may be, the last four years have damaged it.
Lane said the problem of access to the sea's current management of Bolivia's current administration has been high.
He has also eliminated the rest of Chile's argument.
Bolivia and Chile can continue to speak at some time, but then it will be very difficult to make the interview very difficult.
The two countries did not exchange Congresss from 1973.
The former President Johnson Roads Wrights and Ricks, who are the representative of Bolivia in Hart, has rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually sharp.
He said that the Monday day is an unusual opportunity to start a new distance of relationship with Bolivia for Chile and end up the 107 years of mutual advantage.
The McCons rejected that the genus, who is still one of the most popular genus of Latin America, are still using the sea issue as political support.
He added that Bolivia would never leave his right to access to the Pacific Ocean.
The decision of the court is an opportunity to highlight the need to forget the past.
North Korea: Without confidence in America, nuclear weapons are not acceptable.
The North Korea's foreign minister says that their country will never be forced by nuclear weapons when they don't trust Washington.

A display of the head of large size in Paris fashion show.
Don't wait further if you want to expand your own genus or prevent the sun completely.
The Conservatives and Nelson have exhibited the head of the large size head of a large size in the Paris fashion, which turned the style set in Paris fashion.
In this summer, the genus was a prototype of the genus, and the artists have sent their great artists to the Okres.
The tall seeds of the model with the most prominent edge of the mins, such as the most prominent amount of money, were the tall seeds, with the heads of the models.
Other large sizes are designed to keep your head hot, magic hats, and a hat of the same form - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Hatz also showed the choice of the genus species - which is being presented at the time of the Hayss.
Many colors of the color-like painter were covered, and they were seen by Hayn Tylick rather than modern fashion.
One of them was similar to the Googles and well-beings, while one of them seemed to be like the one else-like ice cream.
And if you continue to make the statement of fashion - you're lucky.
It is reported that in a large number of people, such cyconss are to be decorated with the market near you.
The large size hats have appeared after the hats from the "Boogon" made from the hats, which were two feet, and each of the head was seen at the head at the head of the McGretttt.
This extremely undislated species's group label, which had spread across the entire social media, brought another major medals in the Gergres - made by the coast of the beach, which is almost as large as that in the genus's suit.
In the Paris fashion, Gagoni was the genus of the genus of the genus in 1995 with the side of the template and the upper side of the white beer.
The Creek Club Club Club Club told FAP: I expect to be a hat and coast bags in large markets for the next summer – because the artist has left such a huge influence that it would be hard to ignore the demand for the larger size of the size.
John Edward: Education for World citizens
The free school class of Scotland was maintained and the record continued with the wonderful test results in 2018, which has been strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other community's efforts.
With more than 3,000 in Scotland, the school represented by the Scottish Council (SCIS) of Franks Schools (CISS) and parents try to provide the best level of service.
Free Schools prepare their home for the next and higher education, their elected career, and as world citizens.
As a field of education that could produce and apply a best school textbook, we're seeing modern languages within schools as a popular and popular article.
Nelson said: If you talk to a person who thinks he is in his head, he goes into his head.
If you talk to a person in his language, he's sent to his heart.
It is a strong reminder that we can't only rely on English in order to establish relationships and relationships with people from other countries.
With the results of this year's recent test, we can see, languages in free schools are above the league clubs.
The total rate of 68 percent of foreign languages who read foreign languages received high-mature A.
The data collected from the 759th schools of the USSSS shows that 72 percent of Minnes acquired a high-scons, while German reading 72 percent, 59 percent of the French readers, and 63 percent of the Spanish reading.
It shows that in Scotland, free school in Scotland as a support for important skills that children and teenagers need in the future.
The languages of free schools and other places are now the status of the article to be chosen by the U.S. articles (S.M., technology and mathematics).
A survey from the U.S. commission for employment and skills found that 17 percent of the reasons for difficulty in filling the empty seats have been reported in the language skills.
So the language skills to prepare young people for their future career are becoming more technical.
As the languages are required for more employment opportunities, these skills have become necessary in today's world.
Regardless of the status of the career, if someone has learned the second language, would be real benefit in the future because of having a career in such a way.
To be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries and to be able to communicate directly with people.
According to a survey of more than 4,000,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of people were unable to speak a foreign language well, and French language, which is spoken by two-thirds of the rate, by 15 percent.
That's why today's children must be invested in the reading of language.
Several languages, as special development economy, enhances the possibility of getting good jobs for children.
Within Scotland, a variety of languages are read in each school.
Many of the schools are mostly classical languages, while others read languages that are the most important idea for Britain by 2020, such as the genus or Japanese.
Any approval of your child will always be available in free schools, and the academic process in this field will always be an artist.
The Scottish free school is determined to provide a educational environment that creates children with skills to succeed in the future.
In the global business environment of the time, it cannot be dismissed that languages are extremely important to the country's future, so it should be taught in its perspective.
Of course, modern languages should be seen as "the international communication skills".
For free school youth to Scotland, it will continue to offer these choices, diversity, and diversity.

Once again in the new warship of Germany.

The Navy was to join the Navy in 2014, but then the problems of the Daily Manire have damaged the project.
