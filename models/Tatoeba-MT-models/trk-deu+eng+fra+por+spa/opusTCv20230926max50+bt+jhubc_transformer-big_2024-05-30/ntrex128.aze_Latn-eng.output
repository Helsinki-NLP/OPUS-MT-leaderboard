Members of the House of Representatives are concerned about the "substantial
Some members of Congress are concerned about the proposal requiring the names to be changed to Members of the Welsh Parliament (UPU).
This concern arose after the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of Congress on the political spectrum are concerned that they may be ridiculed in this way.
A member of the Labour Party noted that according to his party, it sounds like "Twp and Pwp".
For non-White readers, it is important to note that in Wales, "Twp" means fool, and in Wales, "Pwp" means naughty.
Members of the Pleiades Party in general said they were not satisfied with the situation and made their own proposals.
A spokesperson for the Welsh Conservative Party said the name change was fairly normal for its party, but it should be noted that it was a short verbal transition from the name of a Member of the Welsh Parliament to Toys.
In this context, the letter "w" in the word "Welsh" is pronounced similar to the letter "u" in the English dialect.
He said: “I will change the name of the people, and I will change the name of the people, and I will change the name of the people, and I will change the name of the people of the land.”
The Welsh Government's Management Act of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission's assembly published the results of public consultation to call it the Welsh Parliament, with the change of name receiving widespread support.
On the name given to the Members of Parliament, the Commission spoke in favor of the Members of the Welsh Parliament (WMP), but the majority of support in public consultation was received by the MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
Members of Congress also continue to openly offer alternative options, but struggling to come to a common denominator can be a headache for Elin Jones, the official who is expected to draft and submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
The draft law on reforms will include amendments to the working principle of the parliament, including rules on disqualification of members of parliament and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the House of Representatives will make a final decision on the name change during the discussion of the bill.
Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will take part in Sunday's vote to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The vote is aimed at resolving a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, the province of Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor is named after the province in the country and has repeatedly objected to its membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov has said he will not run for election.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said the name change was a cost to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Church's bells are experiencing a period of silence, as in churches during the Harlem struggle.
"The old men I was talking to were historically saying that there was a bar and a church in every corner," Adams said.
Today there is none of them.
He said it's important to remember that there are no bars.
"Today people are socializing in a different direction," he said.
"There are no bars around their living quarters where people can go all the time."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the revenue from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expected, and he said that "and sooner or later they will have to go back to where they started".
He added that the churches could be replaced with buildings of common property, filled with people who would not benefit from the remaining temples.
"The vast majority of people who will host these buildings on common terms will be white people, and therefore the day of church closure together will accelerate, because it is very unlikely that the majority of people who will move to joint apartments will be members of these churches," he said.
Both churches were founded by Harlem's black metropolis - the Metropolitan Society in 1870, and the White Society ten years later, before St. Martin's Church.
The real white Methodist society migrated in the 1930s.
Nearby, the representatives of the black community, who prayed, gave the name to the church.
The Church of St. Martin was seized by black society under the leadership of revolutionary John Howard Johnson, one of the leaders of the 125th Street boycott protest in Harlem, which is considered as one of the main streets for market protests against blacks' recruitment or promotion.
A fire in the building in 1939 caused him immense damage, but members of the Johnson Father's Prix had made plans to rebuild the building, and they put the carilion into operation.
The revolutionary David Johnson, the son and heir of the Johnson Father, called the carilion "the bell of the poor people" in the Church of St. Martin with a great sense of pride.
In July, the expert who performed the carilion gave him other names: "Cultural wealth" and "an irreplaceable historical musical instrument".
Tiffany Nc, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that 18 years ago, it was the carilion performed by Dionisio A. Lind, a black man, for the first time in the world that was a larger carilion in the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merivezer said that St. Martin would not replace him.
Over the past few months, every instrument performed in St. Martin reflects the mixed fate of architects and contractors, some brought by church leaders who are not of this professional class, and others by Bishops.
In July, the governing body of non-professional privileged men wrote to the bishop, expressing their concern. They asked for "transferring the costs associated with it to the governing body", although they did not participate in the recruitment of architects and contractors who were sent to the bishop.
Some people complained of lack of transparency in the bishopship.
A 13-year-old shark injured a 13-year-old boy in California
Officials said the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who had been on a cancer hunt in California on Saturday, the day of the opening of the cancer season.
The incident happened just before 7:00 a.m. around the bay in Ensinitas.
In an interview with KSWB TV, Chad Hammel told San Diego that he and his friends had been in the water for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he heard the little boy screaming for help, and then began to hunt with a group of men to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought it was the excitement of the boy who was hunting the cancer, and then realized that he was shouting, "He bit me!"
"He hit me!"
"His puppy bone was completely broken," Hammel said, observing it as he took the boy.
"I started yelling for everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was assessed as serious.
The type of attacking shark is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Cayls told the media that the shark was identified in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it was not dangerous.
Cayles added that there were traumatic injuries around the victim's upper body.
For investigation and security purposes, the authorities have closed the 48-hour access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Esinitas.
According to Cayls, there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainbury's supermarket chain plans to enter the beauty products market in the UK
Sainbury's owns Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams stores that have a showcase of beauty products with a staff of expert assistants.
While there is a decline in sales of fashion and household goods, as a significant step forward for the growing UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, the wider beauty products showcase will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be placed in more stores next year.
Investing in the beauty industry is a result of the search for ways to fill shelves that were once used for televisions, microwaves, and household items.
Sainbury's said the number of its beauty products will double to 3,000, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Brands from the L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees range will have more space compared to similar brands available in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also releases its new cosmetics boutique, so most of the products will be suitable for vegan use because this demand is growing among young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a fragrance retailer, will be tested at two Sainsbury's stores, the first will take place at a store in Croydon, south of London, last week, and the second will take place at a store in Seli Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a tendency to buy small amounts of food in daily local stores require supermarkets to do more business to drive people to get there.
Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Kup said that the number of outlets that appear to be offering discounts on supermarket chain services and non-food products will increase as they fight against Aldi and Lid.
Sainsbury's deploys Argos outlets to hundreds of stores and also offers a number of Habitat stores since its acquisition of both chains two years ago, which is said to have increased grocery store sales and made their purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical departments were unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's conducted a joint venture inspection with Boots in the early 2000s, but this merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from pharmacy departments opened in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Selesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will also be included in the plan, adding a number of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have improved the look and quality of beauty products showcases by further elevating the atmosphere for our customers.
We have also invested in our specially trained colleagues who are ready to give their advice.
Our brands have been designed in a way that suits every need, and the attractive environment and comfortable spaces have now become a place of exhilarating beauty enough to compete with the old shopping style.”
Holly Willoby's withdrawal from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal has made Peter Jones "crazy"
TV host Holi Willoby's refusal to sign a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal on his lifestyle brand to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones "crazy."
Willoby doesn't have time for them, which is a brand of homewares and accessories.
The couple's business was likened to the Goop brand of Guinea Peltro.
The 37-year-old host of "This Morning" has announced his departure on Instagram.
Holi Willobi's announcement at the last minute that Peter Jones would quit his job on a lucrative lifestyle brand and focus on his new contracts with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV "smoked off" the star of Dragons Den.
Sources say that when Marlowe, the "gold girl" of TV, reported the situation Tuesday at the headquarters of his business in Buckinghamshire, Jones was very angry - new contracts worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million tell him that Holi will no longer be able to spend time with the brand True for household goods and accessories.
The business was likened to the Goop brand of Guinea Peltro, a deal that would double Willoby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
After the 37-year-old willobi announced on his Instagram account that he had left Truely, Jones left the UK and moved to one of his vacation homes.
Sources say, "Truth is not part of Holin's priorities.
This would be a long-term future that could provide it in the next few decades.
His decision to retire was a surprise to all of his colleagues.
No one would have thought that such a thing would happen if we were so close to the end of the season.
There is a storehouse in Marlow HQ that is ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of this morning, one of the UK's most lucrative stars, will cost the firm millions of dollars in damages due to its serious investment in a range of products, from pillows and candles to household goods and clothing, and excessive delays in bringing these products to the market.
It also means the end of a long-lasting friendship.
A mother of three, Willobi and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have had a good relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Cape, for decades.
Willobi founded the True brand with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the brand's board as head in March.
The couple go on vacation together, and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willobi will be the face of the M<0x26>S brand and will replace Ant McPartly on ITV's "I'm A Celebrity."
On the night before, he said, “We don’t have any information about him.
"We started talking, and then we fell in love."
He ridiculed the news media for his views that some would consider "non-presidential" behavior and his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded by imitating the voice of the news anchor who criticized him.
"I have not given up on anything."
He said Kim was also interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June, which was highly appreciated by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on the de-nuclearization process have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's famous diplomat, Ri Yon Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the United States could not get a "appropriate response" to North Korea's early disarmament.
On the contrary, he said, the United States continues to impose sanctions in order to impose pressure.
During his speech, Trump was more optimistic about the issue.
"We have done a great deal with North Korea," he said.
"We are going to war with North Korea.
Thousands of people would be killed.
Now we have a good relationship."
He noted that the efforts to develop relations with Kim have shown positive results in the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remaining American soldiers to the country.
And he defended his unusual approach when he discussed his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into the arena that's full of this guy, 200 people could have stopped," he said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island in Indonesia, killing hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, there was no need for foreign non-governmental organizations.
Despite the fact that more than 10% of the population of Lombok were expelled from the territory, the country was not declared a national disaster as a condition that facilitated the obtaining of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was quite clear that they did not seek international help, which makes the situation more difficult," Ms. Sumbung said.
While "Save the Children" teamed up as a team to travel to Palu, we're not sure if the foreign staff can work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesperson for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies should be allowed into the area to provide assistance.
Given the ongoing earthquake that has shaken Indonesia, the country is still not ready to tolerate the "rain" of nature.
Although tsunami shelters are being built in the Achex province, this is not a common sight for other coastal areas.
Despite the warnings, the apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Paluda has caused people to lose their lives.
Traveling between most of the islands of Indonesia at the best times is difficult.
Natural disasters are becoming even more complex.
The hospital ship, which is stationed in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for it to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Widodo has kept Indonesia's difficult infrastructure at the center of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
However, the lack of financial resources has put Mr. Coco's administration at a disadvantage, and he is expected to run for re-election next year.
Mr. Coco also faces pressure from the long-standing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where the beliefs of the Muslim majority have become more conservative.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes during the clashes between Christian and Muslim factions using machetes, bows and arrows and other heavy weapons.

Daniel Starric saved Liverpool from Chelsea's defeat in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamfor Bridge Station in London with a score of 89th minute.
Starric scored 1-0, and his team took a pass from Jerdan's disciple about 30 yards away from Chelsea's arm.
He put the ball on his left foot before he shot a long shot.
The attempt "slipped" from the penalty area a lot, moving straight up to the top corner of the door lantern.
The ball finally crossed the Kepa Arrizabalaga, which was thrown upwards, and fell to the door.
"I was just trying to get to that position, get the ball, and players like Shake are always pushing the game forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time for myself as possible," Starric told LivepoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and took the ball and shot it without much thought."
In the first half of the game, Chelsea were 1-0 ahead in the 25th minute with a goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazar.
In the same game, Chelsea's attacker made a pass to Mateo Kovacchi before turning around in the middle of the field to escape to half of Liverpool.
The steering wheel reacted and went into the middle of the room.
Then he took a deep breath and went into the living room.
Hazard broke through the defensive line and beat Liverpool's goalkeeper, Alisson Becker, with his left foot.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London on Thursday at 3 p.m.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
"The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832," the country's disaster prevention agency said on Sunday.
"According to the data, many people were trapped in the collapses of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet," the agency's spokesperson Sutopo Purvo said at a press conference.
In Palu, which has a population of more than 380,000, the ruins of the destroyed buildings have spread.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man as a suspect in the murder of a woman
A criminal investigation was launched this morning following the discovery of a woman's body in Merseyside, Birkenhead.
The body of a 44-year-old woman who was killed by a knife-wielding man at 7:55 a.m. was found in John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect.
Police have asked anyone who has seen or heard anything in the area to contact them to find evidence to help the investigation.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagan said: "The stint is still in its early stages, but we would definitely like to see people who have heard or seen anything suspicious around John Stride in Birkenhead to contact us."
We also ask that everyone, especially the taxi drivers who have found any image that may be important evidence for our investigation on the road camera of their cars, inform us.
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman was living in Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
This morning, a friend of hers came to the scene and asked where she was found.
The investigation continues, police said they are still reporting the crime to the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson's house tried to enter his apartment, but police told him that entry and exit to the building was restricted.
He was stunned by what was happening.
Residents are told that it will take hours to get into the building.
One of the police officers told the man that the entire area would be restricted as an investigative area.
One of the women cried and said:
"It's terrifying."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police cars entered the cord, and one of them left.
A group of policemen stood in the cord and monitored the restriction of access to apartments.
Informed persons are asked to send a direct message to their <0x40>MerPolCC profile, call 101 or call 0800 555 111 and register at 30 September 247 to inform anonymously.
Parliament's Cromwell statue is the latest memorial victim in the series of "rewrite history"
His "exile" would be a poetic justice for the destruction of the Taliban regime of many of Britain's cultural and religious works carried out by the fanatic Puritans.
The Cromwell Society, however, hailed Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
The head of the Cromwell Society, John Goldstein, said: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it is inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, located in the Westminster Palace's outskirts, will be the target.
In the British Civil War, the iconoclasm was not ordered by Cromwell, nor was it carried out by him.
It is possible that the wrong Cromwell was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The mysterious presentation of Mr. William Hamo Sornecroft about Cromwell is evidence of ideas that erupted in the 19th century and is part of the historical life of the character, which many still remember with joy.
Mr Goldsiz told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people respect Cromwell, perhaps even more powerful than he was in the late 19th century, and he was a defender of the parliament and, by his side, the monarchy against foreign pressure.
The extent to which this is true is a matter of debate in history.
It is clear that the conflict that took place in the mid-17th century shaped the later development of the people, and Cromwell became an individually recognized figure.
His achievements as Lord's Keeper are still remembered and celebrated with respect.
The pig caused the death of a Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked the farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China.
In a report to Sunday, the Morning Post said that in a market in Liupanshui, Guzhou province, in the south of China, the dead Yuan artery, whose last name was just identified, was cut off and found dead in the blood.
The pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig roof in Xinjiang, China, on May 30, 2005.
It is reported that he and a relative came from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his relative finds him dead and discovers that the door to the surrounding pig roof is open.
According to the family, there was a large pork on the roof with a mouth full of blood.
According to the report, the court has confirmed that the 550-pound pig caused the farmer's death.
"His feet were bleeding and torn apart," Wu, who was called by his last name, said in an interview with "Quiang Evening News."
Security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The man who killed the yuan does not belong to him or to his family.
In an interview with Evening News, the market manager said that while police were searching for evidence, the pig was kept on the roof to prevent anyone from attacking it.
Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite the fact that it is rare, the fact that pigs attack humans has been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a husband and wife on their farms and seriously injured a man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig planted a Welsh farmer's tractor, and his wife scared him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by pigs in 2012, Manitoba's farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can "entice" them.
"They're just playing.
They're so cute and they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them respect.”
Hurricane Rosa, which brought heavy rains to the south-west of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has begun to weaken as it moves in the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains from the north of Mexico and the southwestern United States, which will cause flooding.
Hurricane Rosa, which was defined in the first category at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, had a wind speed of 85 mph and was located in Mexico, 385 mph southwest of Punta Eugenia.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
By the way, as a result of the hurricane, the bare centers on the Pacific began to move towards the West Coast of the United States. As the tropical storm Rosa approaches the California Peninsula on Sunday, deep tropical humidity will begin to flow from the northwest of the United States to the southwest.
On Sunday, it will rain in parts of Mexico with a capacity of up to 10 knots.
The tropical wet air mass, which then merges with the baric center, will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Rainfalls of 1-4 inches will create the possibility of dangerous flooding, sedimentary streams, and sliding in the desert.
Deep tropical air masses will cause rainfall that will reach 2-3 buttons per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to rain as much as 2-4 drops to the southwest, especially most of Arizona.
Floods will make the situation worse due to the destructive nature of tropical rains.
Due to the danger of tropical rainfall, it is not recommended to go outside on foot.
The rains will produce canyons that will rock the rivers, and storms accompanied by lightning will cause severe winds and dust mists.
The converging baric center will bring heavy rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
It is possible that Leysan rainfall in general can be more than half an inch, which can lead to small sedimentary flows and roadslides.
This will be the region's first rainy season.
Some tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, with rains becoming more extensive on Monday evening and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rains will begin to spread in For Corners on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In the U.S., intense temperature fluctuations can be observed in October, as the poles are getting increasingly colder, but the tropics remain warm enough.
Sometimes this will lead to significant temperature changes in a short period of time.
On Sunday, a good sample of sharp temperature differences across the central U.S. territory was observed.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moins, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will start again and continue.
Most central and eastern U.S. territories are expected to see warmer days from October at 80<0xC2><0xB0>F (26,667<0xC2><0xB0>C) to the South Plains to the Northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York could reach 80<0xC2><0xB0>F, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests that temperatures in the eastern parts of the United States are likely to be above average during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Bret Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched the Supreme Court's nominee, Bret Cavanagh, and Christine Blessey Ford, accused of sexual harassment in the 1980s, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued with regular broadcasting interruptions over Friday's last-minute change: an agreement proposed by Arizona's Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to undress him at a high school party.
In his statement, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure that such a thing would not happen.
More than 20.4 million people watched it, according to Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers have not been immediately available for other networks that display it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the number of people watching in the office.
If you look at the perspective, this number is similar to the number of people looking at the football game or the Academy awards in the play-offs.
Fox News Channel, which strongly supports Kavanaugh's appointment, has reached 5.69 million viewers across all networks during its day-long court hearing.
ABC finished in second place with 3.26 million followers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million followers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
After hearing the trial, the interest continued to remain at a high level.
Flake was the hero who stood at the center of the drama that took place on Friday.
After the Republicans announced they would vote for Kavanaugh, he hit CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he climbed an elevator to listen to the judiciary committee, screaming at the protesters.
The moment when he was angry and closed his eyes for a few minutes, he was shown live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said a woman.
"You know, he's telling the truth.
It was not said to him, "You have power when many women are powerless."
Flake said his party made a statement and had more to say at the committee hearing if the elevator had not been closed.
Cable TVs and live streaming networks all later showed the moments when the Court Committee voted for Kavanaugh to be elected to the full Senate.
However, Flake said that all he could do was ensure that the FBI is looking into the allegations against the candidates next week, when the minority Democrats are summoned.
In an interview with Senator Chris Kuns, Flake's friend, the Democrat, agreed in part.
After a conversation with Kuns and several senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was strong because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the vote for Kavanaugh's approval without being investigated.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to look into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Britain's Prime Minister May has blamed critics of the "political game" over Brexit (the UK's exit from the European Union).
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, blamed those who criticized the European Union's plans to leave Britain's future, which undermined its national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In an interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said in response to Tereza's "stop plan" for Brexit, a proposal by Britain and the EU to collect tariffs on each other is "absolute nonsense."
White Sims shot dead: Police arrest Diteon Simpson, suspected in the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a man suspected of the murder of the 20-year-old basketball player Wyatt Sims.
Button County Police said 20-year-old Diteon Simpson had been arrested and sent to prison on second-degree felony charges.
Officials have released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and the Simpsons, and police say they lost their Sims glasses during the battle.
The WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS, said police found the glasses at the scene, and the test revealed Simpson's DNA.
After Simpson was interrogated, police said he confessed to shooting Wade fatally.
According to his lawyers, he was fined $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office said in a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was gunshots from head to toe.
The department is grateful to the Louisiana State Police's operative group, the state police's criminal lab, the Southern University police, and the residents of the area for their help in arresting the man.
LSU's sports director, Co Alleva, thanked the law enforcement agencies of the region for their "working hard and searching for justice."
Simmons was 20 years old.
6-footer, 6-footer, grew up in Baton Rug, while his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
Last season, the average score was 5.6, and the number of ribounds in one game reached 2.6.
LSU coach Will White said on Friday morning that the team's mood had deteriorated and the death of Whitehead shocked everyone.
"This is a human thing," he said.
The volcano erupts in Mexico City
The ash from the Popokatepetl volcano has reached the southern states of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was activated, and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center has seen a large number of noises and tremors.
Images circulating on social media showed that the front window of the car, like Hochimilko, was covered with a thin layer of ash around the city of Mexico.
Geophysicists noted an increase in activity in the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after the 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
The police clashed with Catalan separatists celebrating the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona following a clash with police in Barcelona on Saturday, which tried to suppress the protests, and thousands joined the rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the popular vote on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists detained by the police threw eggs and dust into them, creating black dust clouds on the streets, which are usually crowded by tourists.
Shortly after the incident, the police began to take action against the suspects.
For several hours, supporters of independence shouted "We don't forget, we don't forgive" in front of protesters in the labor union, shouting "Long live Spain!"
According to local media, 14 people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid, tensions in the region still remain high, but the referendum is still being celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The electorate chose the path of absolute independence, but few took part because of those who opposed the secession by broadly boycotting the vote.
Catalan officials say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when they tried to stop voters from voting at polling stations in the region where the clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups set up camp all night on Friday to prevent state police from blocking the demonstration.
The show progressed, but took a different direction.
The 68-year-old electrician Narkis Termes, who joined the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
"Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying and their eyes were filled with joy, and now they are pressing us," he said.
Although that small victory in last December's regional elections was significant, this year Catalonia's pro-independence parties fought with many of its prominent leaders to either expulse themselves or to wait for a court decision in prison for organizing a referendum and for their participation in a consistent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old, Hoan Puig, who had phoned with the support of the police, said the conflict had been escalated by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting worse and worse," he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders, Oriol Junkeras, who has been incarcerated since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Nominating the European elections is the best way to suppress the regression and repression that the Spanish government has shown us in terms of democratic values," he said.
Londoner: The car was parked in front of the house
Three people, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car crashed into a Londonderry home over and over again.
The incident took place in Balingagard Kresent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Inspector Bob Blemings said the doors and the building were damaged.
In the middle of the night, the car may have been hit by a fire.
With a goal scored by Menga, he won 1-0 over the Livingstone Reincarnations.
Dolly Menga's first win against Liverpool
In 18 games, Livingstone scored a second loss to Steven Gerard as the manager of the Ibrox club, giving the Reyners a matte finish.
Dolly Menga's arm proved to be different from raising the side of Gary Holt to the second tier with Xibernian.
Cerard's team, which lost in the Premier League this season, will face the leader Harts next Sunday, with eight points behind them.
Earlier, the Reyncers will host a fast-track visit to Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
By the way, Livingstone's manager, Holta, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has increased the number of undefeated games in the league to six.
Lillian didn't want to give the guests a chance.
Holt's team had to move forward before they opened the account, their direct game strategy created all sorts of problems for the Reyners.
Even though Scott Robinson passed the player, his effort was incapacitated in the goal, then Alan Lizgou moved forward to prevent Krey Halkett from attacking the gate.
The hosts said they would allow the Reyners to play in front of them, but the guests would be disturbed at some point.
It all started with the shooting of that gun.
The Reyncers won free kicks, the Livingston players opened, Deklan Gallaguer and Robinson united against Menga, who opened the score by hitting straight in the middle of the gate with a ball.
At this stage, the Reyncers retained the advantage of the team, but were unable to secure the defense at the gate, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly fell into a difficult position.
While Alfredo Morelos tried to stop Kelly, the game continued in the second half.
Allan McGregor, the goalkeeper of the Reyners, tried to stop Scott Pitman's blow with his hand, but Lizqou struck the ball with the steppe of his foot.
The Crusaders continued to cross to the Livingstone side, but were repelled, with the penalty flag waving twice for the team due to Glenn Middleton's unregulated game and the hand-to-hand game.
"Fenomenal" performance from Livingstone - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, a Scottish BBC reporter from the Toni Makaroni Arena
Amazing performance and result from Livingstone.
To be honest, they were great, and they continue to exceed expectations on the way forward.
Although their style of play and staff have changed little since they returned to the top, Holta, who has improved the team since the big prize arrived, has fallen.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halket also showed good play and continued to maintain a great organized defense, while Menga prevented Conor Goldson and Joe Warren from holding the ball at his feet.
But the Reyners' inspiration was not enough.
Even though they played well in the past, they still had their standards.
They didn't have a ball in them - they were only able to open the defensive zone once - it was like a wake-up call for the Reyners, who found themselves in the middle of the game.
It was found in different shapes in Cologne.
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, their faces were smiling and the pleasant weather prevailed.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, he went to the Old Town to open a large mosque.
The city is one of the most populous in Turkey outside of Turkey.
While the police cited security reasons for limiting a large crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the mosque, most of the supporters ignored it to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurds, tried to deliver their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to host him in his country.
The protests, divided into two groups, reflected the attitude towards the guest, which was welcomed by some German Turks as heroes, while others were rejected as dictators.
Deptford Road Accident: Bicycle driver loses his life after crashing into a car
When a bicycle collided with a car in London, it changed the world of cycling.
The accident occurred around 10:15 a.m. in the southeast of the city, near the intersection of the streets of Bestwood and Evelyn, on a busy road in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped and called for help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
This happened months after another cyclist's life was lost in the event of a shooting on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Police said they were trying to identify the man's identity and inform his relatives.
The roads are closed and the bus route is taken to a line, and drivers are advised not to cross the area.
Long Lartin's prison: six police officers injured in incident
According to the report, six prison workers were injured in an incident in a high-security male prison.
The confusion took place in Vustershire at the HMP Long Larter around 9:30 p.m. in the UK Summer Time and is still ongoing.
The "Tornado" officers were brought in to deal with the turmoil, which involved eight inmates.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries they had suffered at the scene.
A spokesperson for the prison said: "A specially trained prison staff has been mobilized for the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lar.
Six members of the crew are being treated for injuries they received.
We cannot be silent about the violence that took place in prison, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and will remain behind iron bars for a long time.
More than 500 inmates are stationed in HMP Long Lart, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the governor of the prison reportedly received treatment at the hospital after an attack by a detainee.
In October of last year, police officers were called to the prison after a serious incident with billiards balls attacked the crew.
Hurricane Rosa has threatened the states of Finns, Las Vegas, Solt Lake City with Floods (It is expected that it will be useful for Territories)
It is rare that tropical sediments hit Arizona, but it is highly likely that the remainder of the energy of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the southwestern deserts, risking flooding earlier in the next week.
The National Weather Forecast Bureau has already identified floods from west Arizona to south and east of Nevada, southeastern California and Utaha, including Phoenix, Flaqstaf, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City for Monday and Tuesday.
It is expected that the "Rosa," which will begin with rains near the end of Monday, will pass directly over the Finns on Tuesday.
The National Weather Forecast Office in Finns tweeted: "Since 1950, only 10 tropical cyclones have created a tropical storm or sedimentary event 200 miles from Finns!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that occurs just 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict that rainfall will fall by 2-4 inches, with up to 6 buttons to be detected in Mogholon Rome, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin Desert, it is expected to rain up to 1-2 inches, with a total of 4 buttons.
For those who are at risk of flooding, Rosa's rainfall can be blessed as the area suffers from drought.
Despite the fact that the flooding is a very serious concern, some of these rainfalls will be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently experiencing a period of drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Center, 40 percent of Arizona is in the second highest category due to extreme drought," weather.com said.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit the coastline of Baja California, a peninsula in Mexico.
During Hurricane Rosa, which is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia on Sunday morning, the wind speed will be 85 mph and will travel northwards at a speed of 12 mph.
In the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, the force of the storm will begin to weaken.
Thus, landslides in Mexico from the power of tropical storms are expected to occur in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
In some parts of the country, heavy rains can cause severe and severe flooding.
According to Weather.com, rainfall is expected to fall by 3-6 inches, moving from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and the size is expected to reach 10 buttons.
Rosa will travel northwards from Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical sediment early on Tuesday, which will then cross through Arizona to reach southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main threat to Rosa or its consequences is heavy rainfall that will fall in southwestern California, southwestern Sonora, and the southwestern deserts of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause flooding and sediment flows in the deserts, which will lead to human death, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Inside Midsomer Norton: Four people have been arrested trying to commit murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested in Somerset, suspected of attempting to kill a 16-year-old with a knife.
The young man was found wounded in the area of Exelsior in Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4 p.m.
He was immediately taken to the hospital, where his condition was assessed as "stable."
Somerset police say a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old boy have been detained in Avon, Radstock, all night long.
Police have asked anyone who has seen any video of the incident to call the police.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered from the anger and anger of the Democratic Party."
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless and ugly tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered from the rage and anger" of the Democratic Party during his candidacy.
Kavanaugh said in a statement before Congress on Thursday that he strongly and emotionally denied the allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted him when they were teenagers.
Ford also made a statement on his claim during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people witnessed the purity, quality and courage of the Kavanaugh.
"The vote given to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote given to one of today's most successful legal thinkers, a lawyer who does his job in service to the state," he said in a speech to supporters of West Virginia.
When the president spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, he also spoke about Kavanaugh's candidacy.
"One of the most important elections in our lives is five weeks away.
I am not in a hurry; I am in a hurry."
I will go wherever I can to fight with the strongest of us."
Trump said the Democrats' goal was "to show resistance and hinder."
The first major vote on Kavanaugh's candidacy at the Senate level is expected to be no later than Friday, according to CNN's deputy leader of the Grand GOP (Republican Party).
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims is increasing.
A massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, killing at least 384 people, most of whom were taken by huge waves and thrown to the beach, officials said on Saturday.
When hundreds of people gathered on the beach at the festival in Palu on Friday, the six-meter-high (18-foot) waves crashed into the beach at the resort, leading to the death of many people and destroying everything in front of them.
It was later followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When I reported yesterday that there was a tsunami threat, people continued their activities on the beach, did not run, and as a result, they became victims of the tsunami," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster prevention agency, told Jakarta in a brief interview.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it brought with it cars, trees, houses, and destroyed everything it encountered," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving along the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed trees and survived the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerophotography, published by the agency for disaster relief, showed many destroyed buildings and shops, bent and flown bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftermath of the disaster continued to shake the city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the statement, the geographic location of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the volume of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been evacuated.
He noted that the bodies of some of the victims were found in the ruins of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the number of victims and the amount of damage could be greater in the Dongla region, which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake along the coastline, 300 km north of Palu.
According to Nugroh, the contact with Dongqa was completely cut off without any information.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its staff and volunteers were dispatched to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it could get worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not informing that the tsunami was approaching Palu, but officials said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In a video shared on social media, a man shouts from the top floor of the building and warns people on the street that the tsunami is approaching.
Within a few minutes, a large water wall hits the beach and washes away buildings and cars.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the authenticity of the shooting.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power cuts around Palu, which made it difficult for government agencies to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to government officials, the soldiers began sending aid from Jakarta and other cities on cargo planes, but those who were evacuated still needed food and other necessities.
The city's airport will only reopen for relief work and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Sunni victims in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
That's very nasty.
According to Mr. Doseba, the staff of World Vision International from Dongala passed through devastated areas along the way when the workers safely arrived in Palu, where they were staying in breeding shelters installed in the backyard of their offices.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
That's very bad.
While aid groups have begun to take tough measures to eliminate disasters, some have complained about the inability of foreign aid workers with extensive experience to come to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, only if the disaster zone is declared a national natural disaster zone can the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from foreign countries begin.
That hasn't happened yet.
A spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, Aulia Arrianini, said: "This is still a state-level natural disaster.
"Yes, this is a national natural disaster," the government said, "we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet."
On Friday's second night of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, they hoped that those still missing would be one of the miracles that left behind the sad stories of natural disasters of their loved ones and friends.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been lying under a riverstone near her mother's body for two days.
Indonesia's national paragliding team coach, Gendon Subandono, trained two missing parachutes for the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
I have my own soul, and I have my own soul, and I have my own soul.”
A few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paralyzing community, Mr. Gendon told Palu that he had been sending WhatsApp messages to the contestants who were desperately attending the beach festival.
However, his messages were not accompanied by a double blue sign, but a gray one.
"I think that means that the messages have not arrived," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 during an increase in ATM's account at the Newport on the Levee entertainment complex
According to the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee who raised the ATM's account at the Newport on the Levee entertainment complex.
The driver of the car was preparing to bring more by emptying the ATM in the amusement complex, Detective McCarthy wrote in a statement.
When one person was holding a Brink's employee, another person ran after him and stole the money intended for delivery.
According to the reports, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police were unable to identify the number of the vehicle involved in the crime.
Those who know the identity of these individuals are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Reper changed his name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he posted the change on Twitter, saying, "Officially known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West was known by the nickname Ye for a while, and used it for the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news of the change spread before his debut on Saturday Night Live, which is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande, whose performance was canceled for "emotional reasons," according to the creator of the version.
In addition to the name of the current stage, West noted that this word has religious significance for him.
When West discussed the title of his album with radio host Big Boy earlier this year, he said, "I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and its meaning in the Bible is 'you'."
"That's me, that's you, that's us.
This has changed from Kanye, which means "only," to "Ye," and is the opposite of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is the opposite of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed his name.
Shawn Cobb was known under different names such as "Puff Daddy," "P. Diddy" or "Diddy," but this year he said he preferred "Love" and "Brother Love."
West's former colleague JAY-Z also used deficit and deficit-free, large-lettered versions.
Mexican President Amlo has vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students.
Lopez Obrador said on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use military force to put pressure on the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire on students demonstrating peacefully in the square, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing students with monthly subsidies and opening more free state universities.
He noted that the lack of employment and educational opportunities attracts young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding.
According to Kai-Fu Lin, an investor and AI expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double its funding for the study as China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence.
Although there is no official AI strategy at all in the United States, comments from various parts of the U.S. government have been included.
Last year, China announced its plan to become the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Given that other countries are far behind the U.S. and we expect the next achievement in the field of AI, doubling the research budget on AI could be a good start," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling funding could increase the likelihood of the next major breakthrough in AI in the United States.
Li, author of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishing house's book AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, one of China's most famous companies in the field of AI.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s on an AI system that puts Othello, the most powerful American player, behind him, and later became the executive of the Microsoft Research Team and the president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee accepted the former U.S. government's "Robotics Challenge" competition from the Defense Perspective Research Projects Agency and asked when the next competition would be held to identify the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers have to work hard to earn government grants.
It's not China that's leading the academic leaders, it's corporations."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired some of the brightest figures of universities to work on AI.
Li said that a change in immigration policy could also help strengthen U.S. AI efforts.
He said: "I think it's important that people who have a Ph.D. degree in the field of AI have an automatic green card.
In July 2017, the State Council of China introduced the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
According to Lee, China's National Natural Sciences Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations allocated money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academia work in China is low.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which plans to attract partners from industry and science, and announced the creation of a White House Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Perspective Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has invested $2 billion in AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, the U.S. legislation, which plans to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the country's name and establish a "Republic of Northern Macedonia," a move that could resolve a decades-long conflict between Greece and the country that has prevented its bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, the province of Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name has made a claim to its territory and vetoes its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed a deal on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine Macedonia's ethnicity of the majority of the Slavic population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the bayonet campaign raised doubts that at least 50 percent of the votes needed to be counted as valid.
In the referendum, the question was asked: "Are you in favor of accepting an agreement with Greece for NATO and EU membership?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is a price worth paying for accession to bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I voted today for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia to live freely under the "cover" of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Skopje resident Olivera Gheorgievskaya.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament will follow the results so that the vote is decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to approve the name change.
The state election commission said no violations were reported until 3:00 p.m.
However, this time, only 16 percent of the registered voters took part in the 2016 parliamentary elections, compared to 34 percent of the registered voters.
"I'm here to vote for my children, our place is Europe," said 62-year-old Gose Tanevsky, who was elected in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in favour of a referendum on a name change that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union in Strumitz on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and opened chairs in front of tents set up by people who would coax the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join the service not through the door, but with our heads up high," Kvadarkov said.
We are poor, but we are poor, and we are poor.”
If they do not want us to be Macedonians, we can appeal to other countries such as Russia and China, and we can become part of the Euro-Asian union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
I believe that the vast majority will be in favor of this decision, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said "yes" would be a sign of our future.
A poll published last week by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies showed that 30-43% of voters will take part in the referendum, which is less than the required number of participants.
A recent survey by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy-five percent said they would vote "yes."
For a referendum to be successful, the vote must be 50% higher.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
See also: Manchester City player Sergio Agüero Bryton broke the defensive line of the club as a whole
Sergio Agüero and Rahim Sterling broke the defensive line of the Brayton team at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday in a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
With the goal he scored in the 65th minute, Aguero did it so easily that it seemed ridiculous.
At the beginning of the goal episode, the Argentine striker accepted a pass through the middle flank.
He was among the three Brayton defenders before he made his debut.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players in green shirts.
He escaped from one of the defenders on the edge of the penalty area of Brighton and crossed several other players.
He then turned to the sterling on the left.
With the first touch on the penalty area, the British striker passed the ball back to Aguero, who sent Matthew to the right side of the gate where Bryant's goalkeeper Ryan stood.
"Agüero is struggling with a number of problems on his feet," said Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City club.
"We talked to him about 55, 60 minutes.
That's what's happening.
And he brought us to the place where he was born.”
But in the Premier League, it was Sterling that gave the club a first-rate advantage.
[29] In the same way,
In that game, the ball landed on Agüero's foot in a very advanced position in the Brayton area.
He played a good game with Leroy on his left flank.
He kept the ball on his feet for a while until Seen Sterling turned to the long shot flank.
The attacker of the Coventry City (Sky Blues) club sent the ball to the door with a blow without going out of line.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, at 12:55 p.m. in a Champions League group game.
Sherzer wants to play against the Spoilers' club Rokis.
There's no reason to start a new season with the Neychinils club, which won't be released for the Playoffs (a crucial game period at the end of the season).
But with a competitive spirit, Sherzer hopes to play against Colorado Rokis on Sunday, but is still likely to play in the playoffs for Rokis, who has a game-winning advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the national league's western division.
Rokis won a wild-card at least on Friday night with a 5-2 win over Neychinils, but they are still trying to maintain their first division titles.
"Even though we're playing without expecting any results, at least here in Denver, along with the crowd of people and the other team, we're going to play knowing that there's going to be a game-by-play atmosphere at the highest level I'm going to face this year.
"Why shouldn't I participate in this race?"
The club has not yet announced a starter for the game to be held on Sunday, but they are said to be inclined to allow Sherzer to play in such a situation.
Sherzer, who would start for the 34th time, had practiced shots on Thursday and would also shoot on a normal rest day on Sunday.
The right-handed player from Washington, D.C. is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA (counted by the number of runs scored against the opposing team), and has been exposed to 300 skats (expulsion from the game) in 220 2/3 innings (playing stage in baseball) this season.
Trump is running a rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, the president indirectly touched on the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanaugh.
"Everything we do will be at risk in November.
It's five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our life.
I don't do anything, and I'm in a hurry, so I go wherever I can fight strong candidates."
Trump said, "You're seeing this radical Democrat group, and now you're seeing this happening.
And they use all the means necessary to regain power, you see this vileness, this viciousness.
It is not about who they want to be, who they want to be, who they want to be, who they want to be, who they want to be, who they want to be, and who they are not.
The Democrats have chosen a mission for themselves, "to resist and hinder," he said.
"And you see what has happened in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats angry, mean, and dishonest.
He cited the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, which resulted in a high-profile stunt by the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
"Did you see that paper?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, no, wait, that was -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different ideas.
He is not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
It wasn't a surprise that the momentum activists in my local party held a vote to censor me.
After all, I am the last in line of members of the Labour Party of Parliament who are not well-received because of our freedom of speech.
My colleague in parliament, John Ryan, has faced the same situation because he firmly opposes anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censor movement criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Jeremy had previously disagreed with previous leaders on issues such as responsible economic policy, national security, and European issues.
In a statement released Friday by the East Labour Party, Nottingham said: "We want the rallies to be consistent and productive."
The meeting of the General Committee, which was held on the night of Friday for a large part of the past eight years as a local parliamentary representative of the Labour Party, was similar.
It's sad that most of today's rallies are not in this character, and the words of the "better, more gentle" politicians have long been forgotten, if they actually started.
It is becoming more and more clear that the Labour Party does not take into account the different opinions and every opinion put forward is judged from the point of view of whether the party's leadership is acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremie came to power, when my colleagues, whom I thought I had previously shared the same political views, began to expect me to change my views by a hundred and eighty degrees and to defend positions that I would never agree with (in matters of national security or in matters of the single market of the European Union).
When I'm speaking publicly - and it doesn't matter what I'm talking about - there are calls on social media to prevent me from voting in the upcoming elections, there are long and severe criticisms of the center's politicians, and they tell me I have to leave the Labour Party.
And I just didn't try it.
In fact, I'm more fortunate than any of my colleagues because the criticisms directed against me are purely political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who are not afraid to face many sexual and racial criticisms on a daily basis.
One of the most depressing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of various levels of moral violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin argued that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer open to large-scale ideas, and with every movement of distrust or change in the electoral system, the party is increasingly narrowing.
Over the past two years, I've heard a lot of advice that encourages me to keep my head down and keep my voice down so that I can be at peace.
But I'm not here to make politics like that.
Instigated by the indifference of Thatcher's Government, which literally caused our school class to collapse 32 years ago, I have since joined the Labour Party to try to deliver better public services for people in greatest need - as a local party representative or as a Minister of Government.
I've never hidden my political views, including the last election.
No one can be confused by my political position and the areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
What I'm going to say to those who support that movement on Friday is that if the UK leaves the European Union, it's going to hurt ordinary people, the people's business, and our public services. In this case, I don't understand my desire to spend so much time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my non-electors, who are representatives of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that the threats or political benefits associated with losing a vote will not stop me from doing what I think is best for you.

09/08/2018 <0xC2><0xB7> Melrouz: Unsuccessful at the top of the hill
The last two attempts may have affected the final result, but Ayr certainly deserves to be the winner of this fun Tennant Premier League.
They are now in first place in the table, the only undefeated team among the ten teams.
As a result, the reason that led the homeowner to the victory not only made better use of the opportunities, but they also became a superior line of defense, and coach Peter Murchy has a full right to be satisfied with the outcome of the race.
"We've been tested so far in the games we've played and we're still not defeated, so I'm very happy," he said.
Robin Christie of the Melrouz team said, "Well done, they valued their chances better than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute by Frazier Climo to turn this attempt into a goal put the club in the forefront, but the yellow card given to Scottish player Rory Hafsa, which was released by the Warriors, gave Melrouza a point, and Jason Baggot prevented the opponent's attempt from turning into a goal.
Shortly before the break of the first half of the game, Clima scored a penalty kick on the sidelines of the All-Air club, turning his solo attempt into a goal and opening the score to 17-5 in favor of the All-Air club until the break.
But the Melrouz club started well in the second half of the game. Patrick Anderson's attempt was turned into a goal by Baggot and the score difference was reduced by 5 points.
Then there was a long break with the severe injury of Ruarid Knot, who was kicked out of the game. When the game re-started, the Ayr club re-emerged as a result of the attempt of Stafford McDoual, which was turned into a game by Klimo.
Then the captain of the Ayr club, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrouz wanted to pay someone else the price, with Bruce Colvin's attempt to turn it into a ball.
The host club retreated. And Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card for walking over the Climon despite not having a ball in his hand in the penalty shootout. McFerson managed to get the ball to the crown (shooting the ball in the opponent's field to try to win) by moving behind the forward Maul of the Ayr players (a few players keeping the ball in contact with their hands).
Klimo scored the same goal as Kaylee Roe did once again, after David Armstrong picked up his leg and sent Gregor Henry off for the club's fifth attempt.
The star of the sitcom Still Game appears to be planning a new career in the restaurant industry.
The star of the sitcom Still Game is revealed to be the director of Ford Kiera's licensed restaurant company, and it appears he is about to enter the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old star plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, where she co-wrote and starred alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hemfield.
The actors announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the final series in the show's run, and it looks like Kieran is planning a new life after Craigleng.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
Although the actor refuses to comment on the matter, Kiernan plans to engage in a thriving restaurant business in Glasgow, according to sources from the Scottish Sun news agency.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way for them to the Pacific.
In La Paz, sailors patrol the maritime headquarters, which is covered by a tackelage.
At the top of the public buildings, flags are waving in the color of ocean blue.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the sea bases have the following slogans: "The sea is our right.
This is our duty to restore it.”
In a bloody 19th-century conflict over natural resources, the historical memory of the coastline captured by Chile still resides in Bolivia, which has no access to the sea - as the desire to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
Bolivia's anticipation of the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1, after five years of consultation, shows that those expectations have reached their peak in recent decades.
"Bolivia has a driving force, a spirit of unity and purity and, of course, we look forward to the outcome with positive thoughts," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens across the country and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, which, after decades of hard work, has forced Chile to give a sovereign speech to Bolivia at sea.
Local and charismatic Bolivian President Evo Morales, who faces a dispute over next year's election, is also hopeful about the court's decision on Monday.
"We are very close to reaching the Pacific," he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that even if the court decides in favor of Bolivia, it won't make a big difference.
The United Nations does not have the right to cede the territory of Chile to anyone, and this presupposes that it will not lead to possible negotiations.
Just six months after the hearing of the final arguments, the decision of the International Court of Justice shows that the issue is not so complicated," said Chilean expert on international law, Paz Zarate.
For the past four years, Bolivia has pushed the issue back instead of moving forward.
"The issue of access to the sea has been used by the present Bolivian Government for political gain," Zarate said.
"Morales' litigious rhetoric has undermined Chile's good intentions," he said.
"Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate at some point, but it will be very difficult to continue the talks.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velts, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision would take place faster than usual.
"Extreme opportunities to open a new era of relations with Chile to Bolivia on Monday will give a chance to end 139 years of mutually beneficial disputes," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied the idea that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, would use this naval issue as a political tool.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to speak to the Pacific," he added.
“This court decision is a good opportunity to see that we need to change something about our past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until the U.S. trusts it.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yon Ho, has said he will not disarm nuclear weapons until his people trust Washington.
Rie was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by the promises made at the summit between rival leaders in Singapore.
When U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was about to restart his desperate nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, Rihanna voiced his opinion.
Ri noted that the U.S. protests against the ongoing sanctions and the declaration of the end of the Korean War are nothing more than a fantasy that North Korea will be subjected to.
Washington fears that Pyongyang will give its consent to this declaration, even though it has not previously taken significant disarmament measures.
Both President Donald Trump and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang's seriousness, which is seen as the only way to guarantee its security, to eliminate the arsenal of weapons.
Pompeo will travel to Pyongyang next month to organize a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show will show you the latest fashion of the mass headdress at the nearest Hay Street (main street)
If you want to expand your headwear collection even further or get rid of the sun's rays completely, then don't look for it far.
Designers Valentino and Tom Broune showed off on the podium an unusually-looking series of large-sized headwear for their dazzling SS19 collections with their own style at Paris Fashion Week.
Unpractical headdresses caused a huge resonance on Instagram this summer, and these designers took their eye-catching work to the podium.
Valentine's most notable work was his headdress, which sat on the tops of models, with a beige top, decorated with a wide fur-like edge.
Other very large size accessories included watermelons decorated with expensive stones, witch headdresses, and even pineapples, but they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Broune has also demonstrated a selection of strange masks, which coincides with Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks also had lipsticks on them, and they looked more like Hannibal Lekter than "cowboy" (high-fashioned).
One of the new works looked like a diving suit with an oxygen balloon, glasses and snorkeling, while the other looked like a molten ice cream waffle.
If you have a good sense of humor, you can be happy.
People who follow the style assume that the big headdresses will be visible on the main streets near you.
Large-sized headdresses make it look attractive with the shells of La Bomba shoes, the two-foot-wide edged headwear has been seen by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The cult label on the back of a widely circulated, non-practical headwear on social media showcased a next work on the podium - the model itself in the beach suitcase, almost holding the bag in hand, was a large sequin-shaped beach bag.
The orange rafia bag, decorated with raffia fringes, with a white feather handle on the top, became the most attention-grabbing accessory in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitaj tells Dailymail's FEMAIL platform: "I look forward to the next summer, when big headwear and beach bags will often catch the eye on the main streets - we can't ignore the demand for large sized accessories after such an impulse created by the designer."
John Eduard: Language skills are very important for people globally.
Scotland's independent schools break records of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a number of notable exam results that were developed simply by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music, and other public endeavors.
These schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCC), with more than 30,000 students across Scotland, strive to provide services to their students and parents at the highest level.
Independent schools prepare their students for further, higher education, to take their place as careers and global citizens of their choice.
We observe that modern languages, such as an educational system that can design and implement an individual school program, continue to be a popular and desirable subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "When you talk to a person in a language that he understands, your words penetrate his brain.
But if you speak to a person in their native language, it penetrates into their heart.”
It's a strong reminder that we can't rely solely on English when building relationships and credibility with people from other countries.
This year's results also show that in independent schools, language subjects are ranked at the top of the rankings with the highest exam grades.
68% of all foreign language learners received an A, which is considered the highest grade.
According to data collected from 74 member schools, 72 percent of Chinese-speaking students, 72 percent of German-speaking students, 69 percent of French-speaking students and 63 percent of Spanish-speaking students received A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support the teaching of foreign languages, which are vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future.
Languages are now held on an equal footing with technology subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the individual school program as well as in other places, such as subject choices.
In 2014, a study conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found the reasons for employers’ efforts to fill the vacancies they announced. 17% of the vacancies were due to language deficiencies.
Thus, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing the younger generation for the future career.
With more promising job opportunities where language skills are required, these skills play an important role in a globalized world.
When learning a second language, regardless of the career a person chooses, lifelong skills like this give them real advantages in the future.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
A YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults from Greater Britain in 2013 found that 75 percent of them do not know any foreign language to communicate with, and only 15 percent speak French.
Therefore, investing in language education is very important for today's children.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially the languages of countries with a developed economy, will give children additional opportunities to find better jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the language they teach.
Some of the schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others, like Chinese and Japanese, will be teaching languages that are considered the most important for the UK by 2020.
You will be able to choose the languages that are of interest to your children among independent schools where teachers are professionals in their fields.
Scottish independent schools have dedicated themselves to creating an educational environment that will ensure children's readiness and give them skills for future success.
It cannot be denied that in today's global business environment, languages continue to be vital to the country's future, so this should also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as "International Communication Skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
It has to be.
John Eduard is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will play his first game at the Lakers basketball club in San Diego on Sunday.
It's time for LeBron James to start his first game at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton said James will play against the Denver Naggets in a pre-season opening game in San Diego on Sunday.
It's not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"This will be more than a minute, less than 48 minutes," Walton Lakers said on the club's official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel wrote on Twitter that James is likely to be in the game within a few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
He said: "I don't need to play in this tournament.
Trump's rally clock in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump began campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including Trump's stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
As Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress during the November vote, Trump plans to get support from the upcoming elections in the coming months with a vote of approval to fill the Supreme Court's vacancy.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled to take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 a.m.
Below, you can watch Trump's West Virginia rally via direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh at a hearing this week, which has been strained due to sexual harassment allegations, with the Senate's approval vote postponed for a week during a Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation.
But the main purpose of these rallies is to help Republicans gain attack speed in the November election.
So, according to Reuters, President Trump's five rallies next week aim to "strengthen Republican volunteers and their supporters to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
"Congress control is crucial to his agenda, as the president will visit as many countries as possible, as we are beginning the tense campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the tonight's rally for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could "bring partners from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgh media".
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, where he scored more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morris, a candidate from the Republican Senate in West Virginia, who will take part in the polls.
According to Reuters, Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said: "It's not a good sign for Morris that the president is trying to help him in the polls."
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates its readiness to continue the hope of leading Sunday's one-on-one races
After the three-way meeting, Saturday afternoon races may be what's needed for this Ryder Cup.
The impulse of the wafer is a completely made-up sporting concept that players really believe in and have never been in such competitions.
Do you want to know where the impulse is now?
"They have a six-point advantage before and four-point advantage now, so I think we're going to carry it like a small attack," Spieth said during the daytime march.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of going ahead with an additional four points in 12 games.
As Spieth said, Americans feel like they're losing their edge, and they're inspired at least by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play together all day and score three out of four points each.
Spieth is cited as an example of gaining more points.
These solemn screams grew larger as the round went on, and he and Thomas took a very important shot as they lost two or two points.
The shot that won them in the 15th game was met with shouts of confidence that the American team was not escaping from it.
You have to work hard and think about your game."
All of these players are now behind.
18 holes to make a difference.
Undisputedly, written in the history of the Ryder Cup, the only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's dominant, venerable, four-for-four and non-fault couple.
Moliwood was the only couple to not score doubles on Saturday afternoon, but they prevented attacks on Saturday morning, around 9 a.m. on Friday, and at noon on Friday.
In this round, it appears how their energy has affected the players they lost on Sunday and the crazy crowd, and as Le Golf National approaches its end, there will be no more famous players besides Fleetwood and Molinari who will ensure Europe's possible victory.
It is desirable that they are both in different holes at the same time.
It's too early to talk about Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson teamed up with Alex Noren to defeat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning race.
One advantage in the 9 holes in the front and a double point did not give the Spaniards and Swedes an opportunity to get out of the situation.
There's no one to help you get out of the situation, even if it's Sunday.
It's amazing to observe the morning and afternoon races closely in terms of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give and don't give, and how the strategy can change in a blink of an eye.
Europe has so far played better as a team and achieved a commendable result on the final day, although this afternoon's race showed that the U.S. team, especially the indecisive Stateside, had the strength to fight.
In the final of the European Ryder Cup, he scores 10-6 points.
After 10-6 wins against the U.S. in the morning and afternoon races on Saturday, Europe moves more confidently towards the Ryder Cup final.
The pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, won two victories in the fight against Tiger Woods, raising their score at Le Golf National to four.
Thomas Bjorn claims that Europe has held the trophy with a 3-1 score due to misguided techniques at the American midday races in Hazeltine two years ago.
The U.S. won two games in the afternoon, showing resistance, but could not match the score.
Jim Furyk has to score eight points from the 12-on-one races on Sunday to keep the trophy in his hands.
Fleetwood and Molinari, Europe's first non-professional player to win four points back-to-back, won the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, becoming the second pair to win four points from the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the morning races, they prepared to defeat the defeated Woods and American non-professional Bryson Dechambeau in an even more impressive 5-4.
Woods, who participated in two games on Saturday, occasionally made great performances, but later lost in seven games held in the morning, noon and back-to-back, in 19 of 29 games.
Preparing for the morning games, Justin Rose, along with his teammate Henrik Stenson, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka by 2-1 in the afternoon races to win the world rankings one and three.
Despite the cold, sunny day in the south-west of Paris, the situation in Europe was quite different.
Three-time winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, dominated Saturday by opening a two-point gap with the Americans.
They won 2-1 over the Spanish John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the morning races, and after losing two holes at the start of the afternoon races, they defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy by 4-3.
After only four points of failure twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team was able to return to singles games, although Furyk's supporters are forced to equalize the score to protect the cup.
However, after being second in two days, the counter-offensive on Sunday seems to be something they can't do.
North Korea says it won't be able to "unilaterally withdraw" without confidence
North Korea's foreign affairs told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions have intensified distrust of the United States and that it is impossible for the country to unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under these conditions.
During the annual General Assembly of the world body, Ri Yong Ho said that over the past year, North Korea has taken "significantly favourable measures" such as halting nuclear and nuclear tests, dismantling the region dedicated to nuclear testing, and non-improvement of nuclear weapons, including nuclear technology.
He said: "We don't see any response from the United States.
"Without faith, we can't talk about our national security's lack of trust in the United States, and under these circumstances, we won't be the first to give up arms."
While Ri expressed familiar complaints about Washington's resistance to the "stage" approach in the North's nuclear disarmament project, which would be rewarded for its gradual steps, his speech sounded significant as he did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as he did in Pyongyang in the past.
Ri cited Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump's joint statement at his first summit in Singapore on June 12, promising to work on Kim's "de-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," and Trump's promise to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official end to the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang had to give up nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls for the lifting of harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists that we first give up nuclear weapons, increases pressure from sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes a 'declaration of the end of the war'," he said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us kneel is nothing more than empty expectations of people who don't know us.
It is the only thing that makes us more confident than our competitors.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader highlighted earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the issue of nuclear disarmament had been on the side of South Korea and not the United States, even the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have remained unresolved."
Even the tone of Ri's speech was drastically different from that in the United Nations last year. The General Assembly claimed that it was inevitable that the U.S. continent would become the target of North Korea's rockets after Mr. Satan called Trump a "rocket man" who performed a suicide mission like this one.
Trump, who last year threatened to "completely annihilate" North Korea in the United Nations, praised for taking certain measures to renounce such weapons, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would continue until North Korea completely renounces nuclear weapons.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time limit for this, "whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it's okay."
China and Russia agree that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a speech at the UN Security Council Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue with confidence and success until we carry out a comprehensive, final and verified de-nuclearization operation.
In an effort to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, the Security Council unanimously tightened its sanctions on North Korea since 2006.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a good one.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he expressed that he had only made progress for North Korea in a matter of hours, accusing him of "gangster-style demands."
North Korea has pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "relevant measures" at a meeting with Moon this month.
Kim told him that the "relevant measures" he demanded were necessary for security assurances, that Trump had promised in Singapore, and that his relations with Washington would also lead to normalization.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year's new course at Harvard University has enabled all of its graduates to sleep more to combat the growing macho culture of their "night neighbors" who prepare for classes using caffeine.
He found that academic students at the world's number one university had no idea about basic issues of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, compiled a course in this form for the first time in the United States, he said.
He began the course inspired by his lexicon about the negative impact of insomnia on teaching.
"At the end of the lecture, a girl approached me and said, 'Why do I only know about this in the last course?'
The girl said that she had never been told about the importance of sleep before - which surprised me very much," she told Telegraph.
The course, which opened for the first time this year, tells students how good sleep habits are important in academic and athletic activities and to what extent they improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the university decided to open the course after the students realized that they were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The hourly course combines a number of interactive tasks.
One section features a bedroom picture with coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books that students can tap on, informing them about the effects of caffeine, light, how sports activities affect sleep, and the importance of sleep mode.
In another section, participants are informed that long-term insomnia can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the university campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
"We know that he will not immediately change the behavior of his students.
"But we believe they have the right to know just as much as you have the right to know the effects of smoking on your health."
According to him, there is still pride in "waking up all night," he added, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students also create conditions for insomnia to become an increasing problem.
Sufficient sleep is the "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, fatigue and excitement. According to him, insomnia constantly makes the brain feel hungry, so it even leads to obesity.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physical biology, took one of Professor Christie's classes at Harvard last year and helped him plan his course.
He said he had opened his eyes and was eager to improve the course at the university.
The next step is to require all graduates to undergo a similar training program before being admitted to competitive institutions.
Professor Czeisler advised students to plan to install the alarm clock while preparing for and waking up, as well as to be aware of the "blue light" that, when they wake up, emanates from the screens of their electronic devices or LED lighting, causing rhythmic disturbances and sleep problems of the human brain.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga defeats Gerrard's team
With Dolly Menga's kick defeating Steven Gerrard by a 1-0 score at Livingstone, the Rangers suffered from a distance from another round.
TIbrox's team wanted to record their first win at St Johnstone since their 4-1 win in February, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerard's team as a manager for the second time in 18 games to leave, earning 8 points in the Labrokes Premier League's agile leaders' race.
He struck me seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers weren't so keen on equalizing the score to get into the rankings.
While the Rangers were in sixth place, Livingston settled in third place by goal difference, one step back from Hibernian.
Side judge Calum Spence had to be treated for injuries to the head of the object being thrown away, which in turn meant an additional problem for the Rangers team.
Gerrard moved to the Betfred Cup semi-finals, leaving the side behind by 8 points.
Holt, on the other hand, dominated Hearts last week, scoring 11 points against Levy, and he was pleased that his preparations had frightened his opponents.
Even though the Rangers had the ball, the Livingstone team did what he couldn't with the ball.
Mengan's first retreat, when he turned Scott Pittmann into Alan McGregor's target, they scored in just two minutes, but the midfielder took advantage of his chance to the fullest.
Keaghan Jacobs struck Captain Craig Halkett sharply, but his defensive companion Alan Lithgow was only able to strike a strong blow in the back position.
The Rangers team took control, but in the third final, they had more hope for the game.
Alfredo Morelos thought that the 15th minute of his collision with Steven Lawless should be a penalty, but Judge Stephen Thomson ignored this appeal by Colombians.
The Rangers scored just two shots in the first two halfs on goal, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, openly expressed concern about Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's strike.
While it's against Livi's move to become the opening player of the 34th minute, no one can deny that they've achieved it just because they've worked hard.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' well-planned and controlled game.
When Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson from his Menga team, who was able to maintain his frigidity to finish the game, Scott Arfield did not react.
Gerard took action during the break as Ryan Kent and Coulibaly were replaced, and this change was immediately effected as Morelos was on the wing, but Kelly ran off his own line to the block.
However, with Lithgow and Halkett throwing the ball over long distances, Livingston's team forced the guests to play with the kind of game they enjoyed.
Holt's team might have extended their lead in the final round, but McGregor pushed Jacobs away before Lithgow moved away from the corner.
The Rangers replaced Glenn Middleton with a reserve player as he received a penalty kick for a confrontation with Jacobs.
Title: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Collection: on September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger opened his eyes to the world in Germany.
Geiger finally created the device to identify and measure radioactivity, his invention, which was also allowed to be known as the Geiger Counter.
Geiger Counter, which has since been considered the backbone of science, has become a popular culture where, as in the 1950 film Coronado Calls, scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans actually played the lead roles.
He asked, "What do they call this in the world?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Counter, which is used to detect radioactive mineral substances such as uranium.

A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to see malignant cells.
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to see and destroy malignant cells.
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method is carried out by removing immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory.
At this time, they see the protein, which is considered common for many cancer cells, and are injected into the body again.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize malignant cells found that ovarian cancer had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory to "see" a protein called HER2, which is common in many types of cancer, and then re-injection of cells.
Jay Berzofsky, a professor at the US National Institute of Cancer Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results promise us a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the development of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer diseases, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, by taking immune cells from the patient, "teaching" them how to affect cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of leukemia.
After appearing on the SNL, Kanye West went to Diatribe, a partner of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West entered the studio during a Saturday night concert after a performance that made U.S. President Donald Trump proud, saying he would run for office in 2020.
After putting on his hat at night and singing his third song, The City of Nightmares, he made an angry speech against the Democrats, confirming his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to white people, they say to me, 'How can you support Trump, he's a racist?'
If racism were a problem for me, I would have moved out of America a long time ago."
SNL started the show with a parody of Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh's sexual abuse allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford, Matt Damon, who humorously mentions his testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Although this wasn't released, West's compelling speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
He didn't realize that the West was being bullied.
In addition, West complained to viewers that he was having a hard time behind the scenes due to the hat on his head.
"They threatened me in the back.
I was told not to wear this hat.
They've been warning me!
And then they said, "I'm in the swamp," said the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the swamp?" he continued, "Wear my superman cap, because you can't tell me what to do. You want the world to move forward?
Try to love it."
Variety, with the words of a shash who was there interjected, stated that his comments had at least twice the support of the audience, and that SNL actors were embarrassed: "The whole studio was engulfed by a dead silence."
West was brought in at the last minute to replace the late rapper Mac Miller's ex-girlfriend, the singer Ariana Grand, who died a few days ago.
He played the song "I Love It" as a West Perrier Bottle, and everyone was amazed.
Candace Turner, the head of the West TPUSA conservative group, tweeted: "Thank you to one of the bravest souls: MOB.
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted, "West just looks like it is, and that's really great."
"But I choose NOT to reward anyone because I think he has embraced and propagated the ideology that is harmful to my community (by taking his music or his clothes or by supporting his 'art').
He is free.
He is like us," he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper changed his name via Twitter and "reported that he is now officially known as Kanye West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and was following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, or P Didd.
The previous stage name of the Reper Snoop Dog was Snoop Lion, the late music legend everyone knew as Prince, changed his name to a character.
The man who tried to kill him at a Belfast restaurant was arrested.
On Friday, a 45-year-old man in eastern Belfast was accused of attempting to stabbed a man in a restaurant.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The suspect is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of Justice on Monday.
The Prosecutor's Office will review the charges.
The star of Game of Thrones series, Kit Harington, criticizes male stereotypes.
Kit Harington is best known for his heroic role as Jon Snow in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, however, says he opposes the male stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen must be tough to respect young boys.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought something was wrong and talked about how they could solve problems with male stereotypes in the <0x23>MeToo century.
Kit, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, a side-star in the Game of Thrones series, said she feels pretty ready to find a solution to the issue.
"I personally feel quite ready to look for the answer to the question, 'Do we understand the stereotypes of personality right now?'"
"What do we teach people about the problems they face when they grow up?"
The stereotypes that we see on TV are also part of the problem.
He asked, "What are the things that come from birth and are taught afterwards?"
What are the stereotypes of young people on TV and on the streets about how to become men?
I think that's one of the most important questions we need to answer right now - how can we change that?
It's clear that the stereotypes of young people are being misunderstood.
In the interview, he said he was tired of the battle scenes and horses, noting that after the next summer, he would not participate in any entry-and-continuation episodes of the Game of Thrones.
As of November, Kit will be the star of Sam Shepard's Revival of the True West, a film about the producer and his thief brother.
The actor believes that his acquaintance with his wife, Rose, is the most beautiful thing that the Game of Thrones series has added to his life.
"I met my wife in this series, so this series gave me my future family for the future of my life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a love affair with Jon Snow, whom Kit gave life to in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
H1N1/H1N1: The number of people infected with the virus has increased by 14%
China announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
Most of the new events have gone through the sexual way, highlighting a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spreading rapidly as a result of the transfer of infected blood in some parts of China.
According to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has reached 100,000 every year.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is one of the main problems of China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been considered a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against homosexuals has accelerated.
Studies have shown that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women because of the country's conservative values.
The reason why many of these diseases are transmitted is the lack of adequate sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to medicines for the treatment of HIV, in order to solve the problem in part.
Maxine Waters denies workers' leaks of information about Republican senators, provocations, "dangerous lies" and "philosophy theories."
U.S. Representatives on Saturday, Maxine Waters, condemned the allegations that one of her employees posted personal data of three Republican senators in the U.S. on the pages of lawmakers on Wikipedia.
Democrats from Los Angeles have said the allegations were faked by "extremely right-wing" experts and sites.
"Lies, lies, and more hateful lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published information reportedly contains the home addresses and phone numbers of United States Senators. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orrin Hatch.
The information was released Thursday by an unknown person in the Capitol Hall, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Hill, Gateway Pundit, and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the leak belonged to Waters' office and published the information of one of Waters' employees.
"These allegations are completely baseless and pure lies," Waters said.
"My staff member, whose identity, personal information and security are at risk as a result of false and false claims, is not responsible for the leakage of this information.
"These allegations are completely baseless and pure lies."
Waters' statement also drew the former White House press secretary, Ari Fletcher, to the center of criticism.
"It's a lot of anger," Fleisser wrote.
He added: "He has no intention of becoming a member of Congress.
If someone accuses them of something they don't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They should not be disobedient.
They should not ask questions about the defendant's motive.
They need to be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer compared Waters' reactions to the criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing extremely angry in the Democrats' trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee who replaced Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters claimed that his office had warned the authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false allegations.
"You can rest assured that we will find the perpetrators," he continued, "that they will be legally responsible for those who have committed destructive and dangerous acts and for all my staff members."
Johnny English's "Re-Attack" is a film by Rowan Atkinson.
Now it has become customary to look for the importance of Brexit in any film with a British approach, and this can also apply to the Johnny English film, which first appeared on screen in 2003 and returned to screen in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is there any way to make a joke about the fact that we're a bunch of different people?
In any case, the exploding-eyed, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English had a license to ruin things that were revamped for the second time, which was a type of comic creativity designed for non-English-speaking cinematography.
Of course, he's a silly secret spy who makes a little note about Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and a little bit about the Fire Trolleys at the opening of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally, Atkinson played in a Barclaycard television ad about the traveler and mysterious people from different countries that are now forgotten, left behind by chaos.
There are a few moments of praise in these last JE rides.
I liked Johnny English, who was wearing a medieval armored suit, and who was approaching the helicopter with a swipe at his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy skills are reflected on the screens, but such humor seems rather weak and strange, especially in "serious" films like 007 and Hard Tasks, comedy is already confidently presented in terms of content.
The humor in the Johnny English movie appeals more to children than to adults, and to me, the failures that Johnny English went through are not as witty and creative as the Bean character in Atkinson's silent-film genre.
There is a lot of evidence that the UK is in serious danger.
The cyber-hacker hacked into Britain's top-secret spy web network and exposed the identities of all British spies who are currently in office, putting the spies who are currently performing their duties in danger - unfortunately, Kevin Eldon was given a very small role.
It was the last drop that had driven the patience of the prime minister, who had a proud and ambitious personality and was already in ruins with his political authority: Emma Thompson played the character of Theresa May very skillfully, but there wasn't much to work on the script.
His intelligence advisers told him that after the identity of the spy in each position was revealed, he had to retire.
This means that the incompetent Johnny English now works as a teacher in some well-known institutions, giving unregistered lessons on how to conduct a secret operation: Johnny English teaches some tricks, such as in the Rock-type spy academy.
Johnny English is summoned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, and meets again with Bough, whom Ben Miller portrays, a longtime close friend.
Bough is now married, a man who's blocking submarine commanders, with Vicki Pepperdine being taken care of, pretending to be happy.
So, when everything went wrong with Her Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin returned to their posts, where they met Ophelia Bhuletova, a woman in a stunning beauty portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the prime minister is under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to save Britain from a computer disaster: Jake Lacy portrays the villain Jason Volta.
English and Bough begin their funny and entertaining journey: they disguise themselves as waiters in the French restaurant they're burning; they're smuggled out of Volta's yacht, causing confusion; English Virtuality leads to spontaneity when they want to get to know Volta's home with Reality headsets.
They've worked hard for this last movie, but there's a lot of children's channels about all these intimate and fun things.
It's very gentle things.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think of myself: Couldn't the British film industry have given Rowan Atkinson a role that really suited his abilities?
The working class denies that the British have a plan to work four days a week and get paid five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan for British workers to work four days and receive five days' wages.
According to the party's report, the company's bosses can save money by giving employees additional days off through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
This means that the employees will have a three-day weekend, but they will still get the same salary.
According to sources, the issue is on the party's economic agenda, and they plan to turn it in favor of workers.
In order for workers to benefit from the changing economy, the Trade Union Congress approved the transition to a four-day working regime.
Sources of the Great Workers' Party reported on Sunday: "A critical review of the policy is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
This is not something that will happen overnight, but a four-day working regime is an initiative that aligns with the balance of the economy in favor of the employee, as well as an equal approach to the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to approve a four-day working regime, but for the first time the Green Party promised a four-day working regime in the general election company in 2017.
However, this initiative is currently not fully endorsed by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day working regime is not in line with the party's policy and is not considered by the party."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnel used last week's Workers' Conference to explain the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnel said that the authority in the utilities was determined to take it back from "faceless directors" and "rulers."
Opposition Chancellor also states that current shareholders in aquatic companies may not be able to retrieve their shares, as the Labour government may do some eating, considering the alleged misuse.
He also approved plans to create a Domestic Entrepreneurship Fund to include employees in the company's departments and deliver up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year to employees of private sector companies.
Lindsey Graham told John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation would change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed his final voting period with his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings would pull back the support of any Republican senator.
In the "60 Minutes" broadcast on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter, addressed the Republican senators' questions. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI had found anything that could change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his counterpart from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I went to court and talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
As soon as these allegations came out, I called him and said, "Did you really do that?"
He was strong, determined, and understandable."
However, Graham's vote seemed to be steady.
"My views on Brett Kavanaugh have been clarified and he will be opposed to those strong accusations," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's going on, but I can tell you this: Brett firmly denied it," Graham told Blasey Ford.
"Not all of them were able to confirm that.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what does it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music concert where all the stars come together to fulfill a mission to end poverty in the world.
For the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival has given tens of thousands of people the opportunity to enjoy the shows of stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes in the Great Lawn of Central Park, as well as informing them of the event's main goal - eradicating extreme poverty around the world by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which has been held since 2012, is a branch of the Global Poverty Project, an international defense group hoping to end world poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
If you want to get a free ticket (unless you want to voluntarily buy a VIP ticket), the concert attendees will have to perform a number of tasks, such as taking part in some of the world's poverty-stricken activities, making phone calls to world leaders, or writing emails.
What was the result of the 12-year-old's efforts to achieve his goal?
Is the idea that people are rewarded with free concert tickets an original way to move them to action or, in other words, to believe that people can make changes online by signing petitions, tweeting, or collecting signatures, that is, "clictivism"?
Since 2011, more than 19 million activities have been registered by its supporters, and they are working hard to achieve their goals, according to the Global Citizen Association.
The measures have prompted world leaders to make a statement on their commitments and policies and provide more than $37 billion in aid that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030, he said.
Referring to 390 statements, the group noted that more than $10 billion was raised in the fund as a result of its activities in early 2018.
To date, the group estimates that about 649 million people around the world have contributed money to the fund.
Some of the key commitments include the Fund for the Power of Nutrition, which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's food shortage after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens, mainly based in the United Kingdom, a partnership of investors and practitioners that is committed to "help children grow their full potential."
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make history of social injustices related to insufficient nutrition," Ullmann, Ambassador of the Foundation for the Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 initiatives to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government has provided financial assistance to a project that could help 5 million women and children suffering from malnutrition.
The most frequently asked questions on the group's website are: "What do you think you can do to end poverty?"
"It's a long and difficult road - sometimes we'll fall down, sometimes we'll fail," he said.
But like the great civil rights and anti-racism movements in South Africa before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Among the stars to star in this year's event, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman, are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe.
Using the U.S. Navy, it could block Russia's energy exports - Secretary of Home Affairs
Washington Examiner quoted U.S. Secretary of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke as saying that Washington could, if necessary, appeal to the navy to prevent Russian energy, including the Middle East, from affecting the world market.
Zinke claimed that Russia's design in Syria, where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, was an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to invest in energy, like in Eastern Europe, which is the southern center of Europe," he said.
According to the official data, there are ways and means to solve this.
He said: "The United States will use the naval fleet to block if necessary to ensure that the sea routes are open and that their energy is not exported to the world market."
Zinke appealed to participants of the Consumer Energy Union-hosted event, which is a non-profit group in the United States and identifies itself as the "voice of energy consumers."
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, saying they were equally effective.
He called Russia a "one-size-fits-all" country with an economy dependent on fossil fuels, and said: "The economic choice for Iran and Russia is more or less a change of fuel."
The Trump administration's goal is to replace Russian gas, the cheapest option for European consumers, by increasing its exports to Europe.
For this, officials of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to abandon the "unfavorable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will make Berlin a "sovereign" Moscow over Trump.
Moscow stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double its capacity to 110 billion m3, is a fully profitable project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's violent opposition to the project stems from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September: "I believe that energy is not a means to put pressure on consumers and that consumers have the freedom to choose suppliers."
The U.S. position once again confirmed its commitment to the project, resulting in Germany's counter-reaction.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry (ASF), has called on the United States to stay away from the European Union's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (ASF), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin: "The interference of a third state in our energy supply is a big problem for us."
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "extremely review" the 2020 presidential nomination.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "fully consider" the candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
Warren has confirmed that he intends to run for office at the general meeting of the Holyoke City Council in Massachusetts.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for "women, including women in power, to go to Washington and restore the disintegrated government."
“I will be the first to be appointed to the presidency [of the Council].
During a general meeting of the city council, Warren expressed his views on President Donald Trump, stressing that he was "driving this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm as concerned as my bones about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," he said.
Warren has made his criticisms of Donald Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren tweeted on Friday: "Of course, we need a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation before we vote."
A poll released Thursday showed that most of Warren's voters didn't think he should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Center for Political Studies/Boston Globe, fifty percent of Massachusetts' "probable" voters said they shouldn't run for senatorial office.
Thirty-two percent of the voters supported the nominee.
The survey showed that 38% of voters supported the potential candidate and 48% opposed the former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed regarding the potential 2020 candidate include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden is expected to make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin wrote about her son Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSP) during Donald Trump's rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he was appointed in September.
He was arrested last night and charged with domestic violence.
He told the audience at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, "I can relate to other families where my son lives, they're back, feeling the effects of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSP) and some of the wounded our soldiers have brought back."
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and, in connection with his son and other war veterans, "they came back a little differently, they came back hardened, they went back and asked if each other member of the military, his comrades, and the pilots, were respected for what they had given the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman by holding a gun while intoxicated and interfering in a domestic violence document.
Eighteen states have endorsed the Colombian region's call for a new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a new U.S. policy that rejects asylum requests for victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and regions elected amicus curiae (a court expert) in Washington on Friday to support an anti-police asylum seeker, according to NBC News.
Grace claims the full name of the complainant in her sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit against federal politics in August, was not found.
He said his partner and members of the rabies gang had abused him, but U.S. officials rejected his asylum request on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries facing major problems related to gang and domestic violence, with numerous applications for U.S. asylum.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed the 2014 Immigrants Appeal Council's decision allowing undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Colombia's Attorney General Carl Racine said Friday that the new policy "does not take into account decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires all asylum requests to be evaluated on the basis of the specific facts and conditions of the request, and such a bar violates that principle," he said.
In short, the lawyers said that the policy of refusing to accept immigrants is more likely to be entrepreneurial and "provide the necessary labor" that is damaging to the U.S. economy.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
In a speech on June 11, he said, "The refuge is possible for those who leave their countries of oppression or fear because of their race, religion, nationality or membership in any particular group."
It was not designed to eliminate all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The death toll has doubled as a result of desperate rescue efforts in Palu to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation became even more frightening.
"She feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she relaxes the little boy with fever in a evacuation center in Palu.
"Every minute there was an ambulance.
There was no clean water."
It would have been to see the inhabitants return to their fallen homes, pick up their irrigated items, and try to get rid of everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 were damaged.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from fractured shoulder and back, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors as strong aftershocks continued.
His eyes were filled with sadness as he told them how he felt when he shook his hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding, "I think I was stuck in the broken walls."
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to him and his family.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. Embassy accuses China of violence with propaganda ads.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper, a four-page announcement circulated in the United States revealing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade. The U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
Last Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, citing China's daily pay-per-view supplement, the Ayona's top-selling newspaper, in the Des Moines Register.
Trump's claim that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election has been a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure Reuters on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen levels of customs duties on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's response tariffs were designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime Iowa governor, a key exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in the Des Moines Register on Sunday: "China doubles the rate of violence by publishing propaganda ads in its free press."
Branstad said, "While spreading its publicity, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's free speech tradition and free press tradition by posting paid advertising on the Des Moines Register."
"Conversely, you'll find limited opposition voices on the street in Beijing's newspaper kiosk, and you won't see a real reflection of the Chinese's diverse views on China's problematic economic trajectory, because the media is under the harsh thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Although he did not say which newspaper he was, he did not accept the offer to publish his article "in one of China's most prominent newspapers."
Republicans are turning away from women voters with Kavanaugh Debacle, analysts warn.
While many Republicans defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts said he would see a reaction from women, especially during the upcoming midterms.
The emotions surrounding them were extremely high, and the majority of Republicans indicated they wanted to go ahead with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," Grant Reeher, a political scientist at Syracuse Maxwell School University, told Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that the last-minute pressure from Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for the FBI study would be enough to calm nervous voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief advisor and national representative to the MoveOn group.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" Republicans running the Court Committee demonstrated in the Senate aisle as they decided to advance with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic said.
The party's political analyst, Stu Rotenberg, told the news site that "democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be outside the schedule."
"People say it's high, it's true.
But, especially among female voters in the city and young voters aged 18 to 29, there may be more among those who don't vote even if they don't like the president.
Ford has announced that he has prepared allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts have said that the Republicans will see a run back if they approve.
Last week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said, "This has become a mess for the GOP."
Guy Cecil, U.S. director of priorities, a group that helped elect Democrats, pointed to the news channel, "It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, it's also about how Republicans handle it and how they treat it."
But Americans, believing in what is behind Ford's and Cavanaugh's statements, are a little more closely united with the latter, making it a little different.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of respondents believed in Ford's statement, while 35% said they believed in Kavanaugh's statement.
In addition, 38 percent said that Cavanaugh was probably a liar while testifying, or that only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
"After being charged with Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other indictee, Deborah Ramirez," the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims to have exposed the sex organs of the Supreme Court candidate at a party they attended while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web are planning to launch the New Internet to take part in Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
Inrup, the latest project of technology legend, is a company that created Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where the data is stored and which individuals will be allowed access to which data.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal was "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said.
"This is a historic moment."
These programs use Solid technology, which allows people to create a "personal online data repository."

A unique feature in a personal online data repository is that how it accesses data is entirely dependent on the user.
The company calls it "individual strengthening by means of information."
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea of Inrupt is to bring resources, processes and relevant skills to the company by ensuring that Solid is used by everyone.
The company currently consists of the security platform acquired by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a number of employees and a community of volunteer coders with whom he has contracted to work on the project.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said they didn't talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not a full-fledged change would be made, with all of his and his team's business models completely improved overnight.
“We don’t have permission from them.”
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that the Inrupt's mission is "to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help maintain the new website integrity and quality built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the internet while creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in net neutrality debates.
Even when launching the Intruder, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee said: "I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet.
Bernard Vanne: During World War I, the Victorian Church of the Cross gained fame.
The only church in England that won the Victorian Cross as a fighter during World War I was famous in its homeland for 100 years.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vanne won the award in the September 29, 1918 attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper, and he never knew he had the highest British military honor.
The memorial stone was opened on Saturday by two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic" that the stones were discovered 100 years after his grandfather's award winning victory.
According to the London newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col Vanne "directed his battalion along the Canal de Saint-Quentin, under very intense mist and heavy fire from field and machine-guns."
He then ran towards the line of fire, causing the line to move forward with streaks before dropping the gun with one hand and dropping three of the gang to the ground.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never live with, but something that is respectable."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set the wreath after a parade run by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to participate in the parade," adding that "the heart of the true hero of the support that many people will be giving is being demonstrated."
Fans of the MMA stayed awake all night looking for Bellator 206, instead of getting Peppa Pigi.
Imagine you've stayed up all night to watch the full Bellator 206 to refuse to watch the main event.
The San Jose office consisted of 13 battles, including six from the main card, and was shown live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were getting ready to face each other, audiences in the UK were amazed when their coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not affected, especially after waking up early for battle.
A fan on Twitter described the children's transition to cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
When asked about the transfer, Bellator Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications, said, "The government's regulation should switch to the children's program at 6 a.m. as it's not appropriate for this content."
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, the head of Bellator, said they would be working on their own planning to include UK audiences in the future.
"When I think about it again, I think I'm probably going to find it," Coker said.
But it was 6 a.m. on Sunday, and we won't be able to do that until Sunday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it opened, there were a lot of strings moving back and forth, and none of them were comfortable.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise it won't happen next time.
We'll keep it up to five battles instead of six, as we normally do, and we've tried to do more than for the fans, and we've checked it out carefully.
This is a failure."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels worthless about sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this gives him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't know "everyone is like me" until he went to high school.
Speaking at the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she was talking about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also says that being a parent makes him less focused on winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a long-running show, has been on leave for several months due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a fugitive in Laverne's early program, felt inferior to everyone when he grew up, because "loving boys and girls is not socially acceptable."
She says, "To date, feeling inferior or feeling different has been the real thing that gave me the strength and strength to achieve success."
She said she wanted to prove that she was "something," so she didn't disappoint anyone when she finally learned about her sexuality.
Twice the bronze Olympic prizewinner became a high-profile LGBT campaign, and this year he used his appearance to appeal to many countries by decriminalizing his homosexuality at the Commonwealth Games to be held in Australia.
He said he was happy because he was able to live clearly and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, said he loved a man named Dustin Lance Black - "I was surprised."
Daley married an Oscar winner last year at the age of 20, but said the age difference was no problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer 3 years later - he said it was hard to find someone who had the same experience at the same age.
The couple had a child named Robert Roy Black-Daley in June, with Daley saying that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all because I needed to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are things that are bigger than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer, bears the same name.
Daley asked if he didn't agree that his father was going to die and if one of the last things he wanted to do was buy tickets for London 2012 - he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell her you're not going to be here to be in the front row," he said.
"I held her hand when she stopped breathing, and that really lasted until she stopped breathing, and she died when I finally admitted that she wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"All my life I knew that this was what I had dreamed of - diving in front of the hosts at the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that," he said.
He was also inspired by his first selection of songs - Heather Smallla I was proud of, kept pace with the Olympiads and impressed everyone.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 on Monday.
Mickelson, who was not in shape, stayed on the reserve player bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record in the 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but will have to change the course of the game to avoid an unpleasant turning point.
Mickelson, who played to break the record for the 12th time in a two-year-old race, was taken from the best ball game between rival pairs by Captain Jim Furyk and placed in the reserve player ranks.
As he often plays in the United States, instead of being at the center of the race, the five-time winner split his day into two parts, working on the next game in hopes of being a cheerleader and straightening himself.
Even at the peak of his career, for the most honest racers, the 48-year-old is never considered the ideal age for Le Golg National's tough racetracks, where long road trips usually result in wrong hits.
While the process itself is quite frightening, Mikelson will face Francesco Molineri, who will play in the 9th game on Sunday with the Open UK championship and a team with new player Tomi Flitwood, and his goal is to win it as well as the other three games this week.
If the Americans, who started four points back in the 12 singles games to be played, bounced back, Mikelson's game will become a decisive game.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his player and noted that he could not say anything more than that.
"He realized his importance as a player today, relieved me and wrapped his arms around my neck and said he would be ready for tomorrow," Furyk added.
"He believes in himself a lot.
He's got a lot on his plate and he's done a lot of work this week.
I didn't think he was playing two games.
I thought I'd do more, and that's how we did it, and that's the way we should move forward.
He wants to be like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mikelson will renew Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup games.
He was never able to renew his personal records, which could mark the end of his Ryder Cup career.
Mikeles had 18 victories, 20 defeats, and 6 equals, although Furyk thought that his presence had brought great success to the team.
"Furyk said, 'He's fun, he's smart, he understands jokes, he likes to entertain people, his presence in the team room was such a big thing.'
"I think, like this week, young players are enjoying talking to him, and it's very nice to see that.
"He's giving a team more than just a player."
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great success is soon to be lost.
European captain Thomas Bjorn understood from his experience that leadership leading to the final singles games of the Ryder Cup could easily turn into a failure.
Thomas of Denmark made a debut at Varderrama in 1997, when the team led by Severiano Balesteros won by a very small margin - 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2, although they were 5 points ahead of the Americans.
"You probably remember that we had a great reputation in Valderrama; we had a great reputation in Brooklyn, where we were defeated, and in Valderrama, where we won," Bjorn continued, "but we are leading the National Golf Championships by winning 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 yesterday."
"History will show me and everyone on this team that this is not the end.
You're going to be very busy in the morning.
Get out of there and take the right steps.
It won't stop until you get the picture on the board.
We have a goal, a goal, to win this cup, and we have focused all our attention on this issue.
I've said before that I'm focusing all my attention on my 12 players, but we know very well who the other side is - they're the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the players' success on this difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I couldn't go ahead on my own in this game.
In the morning, it gets worse.
It's the first morning of the show, and that's a different story.
It's a great feeling to be there with your colleague when things go well, but if you're in a race individually, all your skills as a golfer are being tested.
This means that you have to compete with all the players in the morning and put all your effort into it.
"Now you're going to have to do your best, and you're going to have to do your best."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will look for players who perform better individually than his colleague. But with three out of four points, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas make an exception.
Furyk himself had been on both sides of this great last day tour, winning the race in Brooklyn, Furyk lost in the games called "Miracle in Medina" held in Europe.
In response to questions about how Captain Ben Cranshou had motivated his players to the games of the last day, he said, "I remember all his damned words."
"We have 12 important races in the morning, but as you can see in Brooklyn and Medina, you have to start with a quick start.
As the game progresses, he has a lot of pressure on middle-class players.
We have created our own strategy, and we encourage other young people to join our strategy, and we want to create a miracle tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to lead the fight, and in the main game they faced Europeans such as Rory Mcllroy, Paul Kazey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tomi Fleetwood, and lan Poulter.
Bjorn said of his solo selections: "I set the selections in this manner, because I think this method covers everything."
Germany's new warships have been postponed again.
According to local media reports, the newest sailing ships of the German Navy were planned to replace the old, Cold War-era warships in 2014, but this will not happen until at least next year due to the system's flaws and too expensive.
According to a military spokesman in an interview with Die Zeit newspaper, the launch of the leading example of the "Rheinland-Pfalz" - the brand of the new Baden-Württemberg sailing warship has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
These ships were to be added to the army in 2014, the issues that arose after delivery had a negative impact on the fate of this ambitious project.
In 2007, the army ordered four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class to replace sailing ships of the ancient Bremen class.
It is known that their main feature is the ability to defend against strong artillery balls, air and water attacks, as well as some of the radar's hidden technologies, such as the reduction of infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include long-term durability, for example, you can store the latest generation warships for up to two years outside the port.
Die Zeit, which allowed Germany to implement a power project on the seas, noted that, however, regular delays indicate that modern warships were outdated before they were put into operation.
When the German Army formally refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg, there was a lot of news in the newspapers last year about the failed F125 warship.
It was the first time the ship had been returned to the ship.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German press noted that many important "program and hardware defects" would render the warship useless when used in combat missions.
Software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships were operated by 120 sailors - only half of the workforce in the old Bremen class frigates.
At the same time, it turned out that the ship was extremely heavy, which would reduce its ability to operate and limit the future rise of the fleet.
It was believed that the 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz was twice as heavy as the class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to providing defective hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the staff, also became a problem.
It is reported that from the initial 2.2 billion euros reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion).
In the wake of German warnings about the decline of naval power, the problems that infected the new freighters became more important.
Earlier in the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was in fact "exhausted of deployable ships."
According to the official, over time, this issue has become more and more widespread because the old ships have become out of use, but they have not been replaced by new ones.
Unfortunately, he noted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the fleet.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats.
The main purpose of the new study, conducted in a mansion in the highlands of Scotland, is to reveal how bats use natural landscapes in their food hunting.
It is hoped that these findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and contribute to their future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will also include common small bats (soprano pipistrelles), brown eel bats, and Daubenton bats in the Wester Rossda Inverewe Gardens.
During the season, special loudspeakers will be placed in the main locations around the mansion to monitor the activity of bats.
National Health Service staff and volunteers will conduct mobile research with handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all the audio recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and what type they do.
Then we compiled a living map and a report to create a broad picture of their behavior.
Rob Deuer, a nature conservation consultant at the National Testing Service, hopes that the results will also reveal the areas that are most important to bats and how they are used by all species.
This information will determine the benefits of natural habitat management, such as how grass is formed, how forests are best protected for bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by the expansion of work affecting the loss of buildings, nests and habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, such as some chemical processing of fly papers and building materials, as well as pet attacks.
Bats aren't blind.
However, in the case of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a multidisciplinary eco-location technique to determine the location of obstacles and insects on the flight path.
The National Testing Service, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the work of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct research, extensive inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization created Scotland's first and only private bat reserve at the Triw mansion in Dumfrie and Galloway, Scotland, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the manager of the mansion, says that the mansion is the ideal area for them.
"We have a great place for bats in Triv," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees, and a good place to live.
But there's a lot of unknown about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand more of what they need to expand.
He emphasizes that it is necessary to check the bats before repairing the property, because the unintentional destruction of a single birth tunnel can kill up to 400 female and young wounds, and perhaps the entire native generation will disappear.
Bats are protected and it is against the law to kill them, disturb them, or harm them, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferell, a Scottish official from the Bat Protection Organization, urged the public to help.
"We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don't know how most of our species grows," he said.
Ronaldo denies the allegations of rape, and his lawyers sue the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo, using his name, denied allegations of aggression against him as "fake news," saying "they want to promote themselves."
His lawyers have sued the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been charged with assaulting an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel, she paid the woman $375,000 to keep the incident a secret.
The 33-year-old Ronaldo said on Instagram that the allegations were "fake news" to his 142 million followers.
"No. No. No. No.
What they say today is fake news," Ronaldo, who won the Ballon d'Or five times, told the camera.
"They want to introduce themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of their job.
"I'm very happy and I'm very happy," he added with a laugh.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they call the "unreasonable report of doubts in the field of privacy."
Lawyer Christian Schertz was told that the player would require a "moral injury" compensation amount corresponding to the level of this illegality, perhaps one of the most serious cases in the field of personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casinos in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting in the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga said they had returned to the players' room, where they were subjected to anal harassment, as is known from documents filed at the Clarrk District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and claimed that "99 percent" was a "good guy" and that "one percent" had wronged him.
The papers reveal that Ronaldo had sex, but that it was mutual.
He also claimed that Mayorga went to the police and photographed his wounds in the hospital, but later decided to settle them outside the court because he was afraid of "vengeance from the other party" and being subjected to public condemnation.
The 34-year-old woman said she would also change her place of residence as she continued to experience trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Real Madrid during the alleged rape, and this summer he moved to Juventus, where a 100-euro return was met by Italian giants.
Brexit: Britain will be "forever disappointed" by the loss of automakers
"It will be very disappointing for the UK to lose its status as a world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit," Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
"It's about Toyota telling the BBC that if it leaves the EU without any agreement, it will temporarily suspend production at the Burnaston factory near Derby."
"We need to make a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker noted that the impact of border delays in the Brexit event could be costly.
Burnaston manufactures Toyoto Auris and Avensis, which produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will see production stop in our factory," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyoto in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers are afraid to leave the EU without an agreement on what border trade will look like, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
One of the main concerns that car manufacturers are concerned about is the supply chain risks in the Brexit event.
Toyoto's production line is driven by a "plane time" criterion, with parts delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for machine ordering.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there could be disruptions on the border that could lead to industry delays and part shortages, as it is said.
It is impossible to store more than a day's worth of inventory at the Derbishir plant for Toyoto, the company noted that production will be discontinued.
He said: “There is no doubt that this is a sign of the coming of the Messiah, and that He is the promised Messiah.
"We need to get an agreement. We want to do the best we can, not just to succeed as I'm saying at the moment, but to get this opportunity," BBC Radio 4 said in its "Today" program.
"Evidence from other manufacturers, not just Toyota, is that we have to continue with something that is entirely made up of high-end supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be halted, but it has warned that the long-term additional costs will reduce the plant's competitiveness and will eventually be spent on work.
Peter Tsuvallaris, who has worked in Burbnaston for 24 years and is a Union developer at the factory, says the company's representatives are very concerned about one issue: "In my experience, these things never come back once they're gone."
He said: "We have come up with an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.
According to the White House, the Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for a week" as the fight against Supreme Court representative Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the case of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's election interference, relations between Russia with Trump's aid, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
Trump's decision to dismiss the deputy attorney general and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has increased Washington's rumors over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a device to record the talks with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this information.
Last week, however, he was sent to the White House because of his resignation.
Meanwhile, a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York City was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "preferred" Rosenstein's dismissal, but then Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexually abhorrent behavior, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, were suspended in court hearings to avoid confronting the Senate Judiciary Committee.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation, further delaying the vote at the plenary session of the Senate against Kavanaugh's charges.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
Answering the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date for the meeting is not set, it could take place this week, given all the other events that have taken place in the Supreme Court, I could have predicted the same weekly delay.
I like to be a witness, and I like to be a witness.”
Some journalists disagree: Sanders has not held briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of briefings was not due to the TV reporters' "play against the republic" antipathy, although he added, "I will not object to the idea that they are the tribune."
He then proposed to develop a direct relationship between Trump and the press.
He added that "the president holds more S<0x26>C sessions than any president before him": "We've looked at those numbers."
Sanders stressed that the briefings will continue in the same manner as before, "but if the press has the opportunity to address direct questions to the president of the United States, it is certainly better than an interview with me.
We try to do this often, and in the last few weeks, we have seen it happen many times, and in cases where we have the opportunity to speak directly with the president of the United States, it will replace the press briefing."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or at press conferences with high-ranking officials.
Only press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president has probably demonstrated why he is sometimes free and sometimes oddly dressed in front of the assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to EU employees at MSX in Scotland about Brexit's hesitancy
The Minister of Health appealed to EU employees working at MSX in Scotland to express their gratitude to the state and wish to stay there after Brexit.
China's Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already claimed the status of EU citizens working in public services.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "Negotiations on the separation between the United Kingdom and the EU continued throughout the summer, which in turn should lead to expected results this autumn.
However, the UK government is also tightening its own preparations for the possibility that an agreement will not be reached.
I know it's a big concern for all of you.
I would like to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
The valuable experience and skills that improve and strengthen the health care of the EU and its colleagues beyond its borders benefit the population and patients we serve.
Your home is your home, and we want you to be safe.”
Christy Abercrombie was diagnosed with a brain tumor
Michael Organ, Tennessee State Tigers half-defender Christie Abercrombie, said he had an emergency operation on Saturday after his injury to Vanderbilt Commodores in a game he lost to 31-27.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that he was nearing the end of his term.
He said: “He came down and he was in the middle of it.
Before putting him on the map and taking him for further examinations, the coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines.
A Tennessee official, Nashville, told Chris Harris, a WSMV television reporter in Tennessee, that Abercrombie had not been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information yet on the type/degree of the body," and Tennessee is trying to determine when the damage was received.
Red T-shirted, second-year student Abercrombie is in his first season after moving from Illinois to Tennessee.
He had five full strikes before he left the game on Saturday, which brought his season's score to 18.
When buying real estate in the UK, a higher state fee will be charged than foreign buyers.
According to Tory's new plans, the extra cash used to help the homeless will be charged higher state duties than foreign buyers when buying real estate in the UK.
This step will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
An increase in government fees will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
In order to help the homeless, the Treasury estimates it will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Teresa May will announce today that with additional cash used to help the homeless, higher state duties will be imposed on foreign buyers who buy real estate in the UK.
This step will be assessed as neutralizing the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters through his promises to provide housing on more favorable terms and targeting a high-income level.
With additional cash, the increased state duty, which encourages the Government's attempts to combat homelessness, will be imposed on individuals and legal entities in the United Kingdom who do not pay taxes.
The surcharge for the current state fee, including higher-level payments on the second houses and rented houses two years ago, can amount to up to 3%.
The Treasury estimates that this step will increase annual revenue to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million.
According to estimates, 13% of newly built London properties are bought by non-residents of the United Kingdom, which creates a surge in prices and challenges for first-time buyers of apartments.
Most of the country's affluent districts, especially the capital, have become "nightmares" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was proposed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in state duties to help many young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping high prices for real estate by not using land and called on Ms. May to give up quotas for affordable apartments in the UK in order to correct the "disgrace of housing construction."
Mr. Korobin announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including unprovoked expulsion and control over lease rights.
He also wants to give the council more power to build new apartments.
Ms. May said: "Last year I announced that I would dedicate my Prime Minister to the restoration of the will of the British people - life should be better for every new generation.
And that's what it means to build our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it would not be fair to say that buying housing for non-residents, as well as for foreign-based companies, should be in the same ease as buying housing for those who are busy working in the UK.
The desire to have a home has become inaccessible to many people, and the degradation of the homeless remains a sharp reality.”
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to run Scotland."
Anderlend's boss Jack Ross says his "main goal" is to become Scotland's governing body at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is currently enjoying the creation of a Northeastern club, which is third in the first league with a three-point advantage.
After returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season, he moved to Light Stadium this summer.
"I wanted to play as a footballer for my country.
I was given a B cap, and it was true," Ross told the BBC Sportssound.
"I grew up watching Scotland with my father in Hempden when I was a kid, and that always made me cry back.
This is only possible if I am able to do so in the presence of my Lord."
As Sanderland managers, Ross' successors include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allarys, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Qasa Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic, who previously denied the overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Tangan, said he had no concerns about the continuation of such a well-known series of titles at such a large club.
"Now my success will be assessed by saying, 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
He said: “This is the place where he will be remembered for his bravery and bravery.
“It’s not an easy task to get to that level, but I’m probably only successful if I can get the club back to that league.”
Ross started his own management career for three years after being an assistant to the boss at Dambarton and 15 months in the coaching staff of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa get them back on their feet after losing to the third level, raising St Mirren to the championship's winner level the following season.
And Ross notes that he is now feeling more comfortable than he has ever been playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
When she was asked about her role in the film, she said, "I think it's a bit of a stretch."
"I really believed that managing more than playing is the right choice for me.
That sounds strange, because I was good at it, I was good at it, and I benefited from some of its logical advantages.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to do every week.
I still experience them in terms of stress and tension of work, but management feels more free.
I have always wanted to run, and now I'm training with it, and this is the most comfortable turn I've felt in my entire adult life."

The summer heat has stimulated the revenues of Britain's financially troubled pubs, but the pressure on restaurant chains has increased.
The group of pubs and bars reported a 2.7% increase in sales for July and a 4.8% decrease in restaurants.
Peter Martin, a spokesperson for CGA business consulting, said: "Britain's longer participation in the World Championships than expected and continued sunny days have shown that July has passed with the scheduling of the previous June, when the revenues of pubs have increased by 2.8% and restaurants have lost more.
A 1.8% drop in restaurant sales recorded in June was even worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars run by the strongest with similar indicators are more than restaurants.
Although they were not as dramatically damaged as restaurant operators, food-based pubs were also damaged on sunny days.
It looks like people are just going for a drink.
In the month of Ararat and the month of Ararat, the month of Ararat is the month of Ararat (the month of Ararat) and the month of Ararat (the month of Ararat).
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM for leisure organization and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we saw at the end of April.
When it comes to out-of-home market sales, the impact of weather and major social and sporting events remain the biggest factors.
Although a 4.8% drop in sales in the annual calculation will be even more deplorable due to ongoing price pressures, it is not surprising that the restaurant group is still struggling.
The long-running hot summer couldn’t have come at the worst time for food-based operators, and time will tell if the milder air temperature we observed in August will provide such an important break.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, in July, was 2.7%, showing a decrease in the market launch of brands.

One in five children has social media accounts hidden from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children under the age of 11 has social media accounts hidden from their parents and teachers.
The results of the survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in "fake Insta" pages.
This increased the risk of sexual harassment and the spread of sexual harassment.
20% of students said they had "fundamental" accounts to show to their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed the rapid growth of "fake Insta" accounts – a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
This increased the risk of sexual harassment and the spread of sexual harassment.
20% of the students said they had "base" accounts that were censored to show to their parents, while they also had their own accounts.
A mother who encounters her 13-year-old daughter's secret site finds a teenager who attracts others with a call to "force me."
According to research conducted by the United Kingdom Digital Awareness and the Conference of Directors and Directors, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and even half of them admit that they manage personal accounts.
MMK Chairman Mike Bükenen said: "We are concerned about the desire of the majority of teens to create an online environment where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilid Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish board of Light Athletics
Eilid Doyle was elected as non-executive director to the annual general meeting of the governing body of the Scottish Athletic Administration.
Doyle, as Scotland’s most-awarded athletic athlete and chairman of Yen Bitty, described this step as a great opportunity for anyone who supports sports and to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"September has great respect for Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world in lightweight athletics, and we are confident that Scotland's lightweight athletics will benefit greatly by inviting him to join the squad," he said.
Doyle said: "I am eager to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
Of his four Olympic golds, the American Ismailist, who won the 200 and 400 metres in Atlanta at the 1996 Olympics and is now a professional BBC sports commentator, is unable to walk after the attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today, I had a brain tumor and had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will be able to get well or to what extent I will be able to recover.
It was a very stressful job, but he was completely healed, started walking again, and is already training in agility today!
Thank you for your inspiring message!"
Comparing mothers to cows, the dairy ad creates an online discrepancy.
The company that manufactures dairy products has distinguished online ads that compare mothers to dairy cows.
Elvie, which is trained in the production of consumer technologies to show that the machine, described as "the world's first silent-weared milkshake," was released, released an ironic music video commercial to show the mothers the freedom of the new machine while singing.
Four real mothers dance to the words of this music in the chopping of the cows: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails" and "If you don't see them, they're not socks, they're my breasts."
He said, "I have given birth to a son, I have given birth to a son, I have given birth to a son, I have given birth to a son, I have given birth to a son."
However, ads posted on the company's Facebook page have sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has not been unanimously welcomed by viewers, and most have even noted that it sheds light on the "terror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very unthinkable decision to advertise this product using cows.
One commented that they, like us, have to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, but unlike us, their offspring are taken away a few days after birth.”
Elvie's breastfeeding apparatus is invisibly placed inside the breastfeeding mother's bustle (Elvie/Mama)
Another commented: "It is clear that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
Why don't you use this as an alternative to breastfeeding for mothers who are still breastfeeding their babies?"
Another added: "This is a far cry from reality."
One woman stated that she considered the song "student," while others justified the advertisement.
"I think that's a great idea.
If I were still wearing a helmet, I'd get one.
It made me feel like I was a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
He said: “This is a great book.
Another commented: "This is a funny commercial for mothers who are milked and feel like 'cows' (often at work or in the toilet).
This is not an advertisement or a criticism of the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that all of them danced with a milkshake that was invisibly placed in the back of their bustards.
The concept of the campaign is based on the idea that the majority of women breastfeeding feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Milkshake apparatus is completely silent, has no wires and pipes, and is invisibly placed in the back of the bustle for breastfeeding mothers, giving them the freedom to move, keep their babies, and even go for a walk while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin of BKD at Partner and Mother said: "Elvie's milkshake is a revolutionary product that is powerful and deserves a provocation presentation.
In light of the parallels between dairy cows and women, we wanted to milk and light up all its difficulties, but also to demonstrate in a fun and heart-warming way the incredible sense of freedom that a new dairy apparatus will offer.
This isn't the first time that Elvis has been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, two children's designer Marta Yakubovsky was featured on the podium during the use of the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to tent camps on the Texas border.
Despite the harsh rhetoric and policy pursued by the Trump administration, the number of migrant children who cross the border each month has remained relatively unchanged, with a sudden increase in the number of migrant children detained.
As a rule, the majority of sponsors were self-immigrants who did not have a document, and were afraid to step forward and risk their own ability to stay in the country by demanding children.
The risk increased in June when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and adult members of their families would have to submit their fingerprints and that this information would be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, confirmed in front of Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of individuals who applied to sponsor underage underage.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously convicted.
About 80% of the sponsors or members of their families are illegally resettled in the country, and a significant part of them are criminal aliens.
Mr. Albens said that this is why we continue to pursue these men.
In an effort to speed up the process of placement of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of the detainees to appear in court within a month, rather than 60 days after their arrest as before, according to asylum officials.
Most of them will go to a judge in immigration cases through a videoconference, rather than in person, to make a claim about their legal status.
Those who do not have the right to seek help will be deported.
According to refugee workers and reports from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in prison, the more likely they are to be excited and depressed, which can lead to violent explosions and attempts to escape from prison.
Lawyers noted that the signs of such problems as the child's struggle with difficulties increase in larger enterprises such as Tornilo, who is overlooked due to the size of the enterprise.
They added that the trauma, which many are already struggling with, can become even deeper due to the lack of time for emotional preparations and goodbyes with friends when children are placed in a tent camp.
Syria has ordered U.S., French and Turkish "occupied forces" to withdraw their troops immediately.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualam has called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes despite the country's ongoing war.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign armed forces had settled illegally in Syria on the grounds of rehabilitation with terrorism and that "this issue will be dealt with appropriately."
He told the Assembly participants that they should leave our lands immediately and unconditionally.
He insisted that the "war on terrorism" in Syria, which has killed 360,000 people since 2011 and has left millions of people homeless, was "almost over."
He said Damascus would continue this holy struggle "until the terrorist group and any illegal foreign interference freed all Syrian lands."
The United States has about 2,000 military personnel in Syria who are training and advising mainly Kurdish forces, as well as Syrian Arabs who are fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of a war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, he said the conditions for their return were good, and he accused some Western countries of "spreading irrational fear" that forced them to stay in their country.
He said: "We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help refugees return to their homes.
They are human, they are human, they are human, they are human.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone at the main Idlib rebel base has provided an opportunity for further negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region of three million people.
However, he stressed that the agreement had "accurate deadlines" and expressed hope that the military operations would be carried out against jihadists, as well as fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, and that they would be "annihilated."
UN diplomat Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee, which will soon include the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
The teacher explained the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the commission's work should be limited to "a review of the articles of the existing constitution" and warned against interference.
Why is Trump going to win in the second round?
If the impeachment and scandal don't end prematurely, as most liberal viewers hope, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 presidential election.
"This will certainly be the most dramatic finale in the history of his presidency!"
At this point, there is no indication that the watchers are tired.
Since 2014, premium time ratings have more than doubled – up to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly three times on MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nilsen's press release, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has surpassed the mainstream ratings of 3.5 million viewers.
The director of the ABC drama "The Designated Survivor", Nil Ber Ber, said about a member of the cabinet who became president after the attack on the Capitol, "it's a fire that people are craving because it's not something we understand."
"Just Funny Parts: Several Hard Facts About Getting into the Hollywood Boys Club," author and veteran comedian Nell Skovell has another theory.
He recalls his trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would listen to Mr. Trump.
And he said, “Why?”
Mrs. Skovell said the driver replied, “Because it makes me laugh.”

Money from abroad is transferred to the most intensive races.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Quarter was hit by a financial influx as a result of the reorganization of the neighborhoods where two candidates were fighting for the same place in Congress.
This is against the newly drawn Pittsburgh neighborhood Democrats' representative, Conor Lemba, who won the election in another neighborhood last summer.
Lemb is currently battling Republican Kit Rotfuss, who represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is violently similar to the new 17th neighborhood.
In January, the maps were retracted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declared that the old neighborhoods were unconstitutionally calculated in favor of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th Quarter led to a financial battle between the financial institutions of the main parties to finance the campaign – the Democratic Congress Committee (DPKK) and the Republican National Committee (RPMK).
Lemb was known for his subtle victory in the widely-watched early elections held in the 18th District of Pennsylvania in March.
For more than a decade, this position belonged to the Republican nominee, and President Donald Trump won the state by 20 points.
Political analysts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. was planning to impose sanctions against El Salvador because of its support for China, but later withdrew from the idea.
The diplomats noted that under the pressure of Washington, they have already recognized Beijing.
Mr. Trump had an intimate meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he stayed at the hotel until the partners pulled out the Trump Organization's board of directors.
In a speech earlier this month, the department's press secretary, Heather Nauert, said that the State Department officials decided to recall the U.S. heads of the diplomatic mission in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan."
However, the sanctions were only considered in 2017 against El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid, including drug inspections, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including targeted restrictions on issuing visas and cuts in financial aid, would be difficult for the Central American country and its high-level unemployment and criminality.
Based on the progress of the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials have postponed a high-level conference on economic development and security to organize an analogue of the first meeting, which is considered a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from immigrating to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior officials of the administration stopped considering sanctions against El Salvador, saying they wanted the conference to move forward.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence was nominated to address the meeting, scheduled for mid-October, as a reference to the appointment of administrative posts during the meeting.
And the three U.S. ambassadors quietly returned from Washington to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new, hard-of-mind settlements and sanctions.
White House official Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the conversation described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to continue internal discussions on the condition of confidentiality.
Their reports were confirmed by external analysts who spoke on condition of confidentiality and were close to the presidential administration.
The history of research
The next step may be the report of Robert Mueller, a special adviser on possible obstacles to Mr. Trump's justice, where there is now very important evidence in the public information.
According to rumors, Mr. Müller has also focused his investigation on whether the Trump campaign was going to negotiate with Russia because it interfered in our elections.
If Congress fails, Mr. Trump will reveal himself in this body as he prepares to speak in front of voters again, and possibly before a jury of people with the same rights as he did in the end.
But there are many, and I don't mean to imply that Mr. Trump's landing is inevitable, just like his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices that must be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
If the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich, German officers would have been ready for a coup against Hitler in 1938.
We were defeated, and in the years that followed, we missed the opportunity to prevent bloodshed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the ruthless anthem of democracy is copied or delayed.
With a few of these points, Americans are now facing a turnaround.
What would happen if Mr. Trump dismissed Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who was responsible for Mr. Muller’s investigation?
He is in trouble after last year's newspaper reported that Rosenstein had secretly offered to listen to the president and that he thought he was unfit for the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times' explanation is not correct.
"How are we going to react to Brett Kavanaugh's recent request for the FBI to be completely or unfair, or if the allegations of sexual violence and false testimony are verified by the Supreme Court, even if they are credible?
And, more importantly, are we going to vote for the Congress that will bring Mr. Trump to justice?
If we do not pass this test, democracy will not be established for a long time.

On the eve of the Rapid Vienna conflict, the Reyners' Grem Dorrans optimised
In the aftermath of the victory over the Austrians in Spain earlier this month, which had no significant impact on Villarreal, the Reyners accepted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory would give them a strong position in Group G of the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented half-defensive Grem Dorranse from playing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villareal, but he believes the Reyncers can use this result as a trampoline to achieve greater success.
The 31-year-old said: "It was a good moment for us because Villareal is a good partner.
"We were hoping to win the game and come back.
Maybe we could have done it at the end of the game, but I don't think the score was a fair result.
They may have been better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
As for Thursday night, it's a bigger European night.
"I hope we can win three points, but it will be a difficult game, so the opponent has done well in his last games, but given the crowd that supports us, I am confident that we can move forward and achieve a positive result.
It was hard last year, considering my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor to earn a degree.
It's a good team, and the players really enjoy it; training is also good.
I hope that we will be able to do that and we will be able to do that.”
Women can't sleep because of social security.
Although all the survey participants had a clear idea of how to care for them, very few talked about it with family members.
About half of those surveyed said they talked to their spouses about long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member who will take care of them, but they don't take any steps to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the National life insurance business.
We've got to start here.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you unless you make your wishes clear in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to take care of them, so that those choices can be a leading factor in determining the price.
Ask your financial adviser to help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
In order to cover your financial costs for long-term care, your options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid insurance policy with a cash payment, or a free insurance policy as long as you have money.
Collect your legal documents: Go ahead with legal battles on the way to the goal.
Get a medical certificate to appoint a trusted person to supervise the medical care and to fulfill your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, take into account the reliability of your financial statements.
If you can't do it yourself, you need to choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure the payment of your accounts.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is on his way to the hospital with an emergency call.
Are you able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Make sure that the details are written in advance so that you are prepared.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official figures, at least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake and tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, on Friday.
Due to the interruption of communications, emergency officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala rehab, located north of Palu, near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In the aftermath of the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi in 2017 with a population of about 379,800.
The city celebrates its 40th anniversary with an earthquake and tsunami.
On the northwest coast of the island of Dongala Sulawesi, it is a regent stretching 180 miles (300 km) along the coast.
The province is an administrative territory smaller than the province, with a population of about 299,200 people in 2017.
The starting point of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Dongalan, is fishing and farming.
The production of nickel also plays an important role in the province, but concentrates mainly on the opposite coast of Sulawesi, in Morovali.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Reduction of the Dangers of Emergency Situations, Palu and Dongala have been repeatedly affected by the tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed in the Dongala tsunami, hundreds of houses were destroyed.
Nine people were killed in Dongala as a result of the tsunami in 1996.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Flame arc, a seismological area, and is regularly surrounded by earthquakes.
The main causes of earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: On the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ajax, north of Sumatra, a powerful earthquake on December 26 struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of which was due to Ajax.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes occurred on the western coast of Sumatran in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias in the Sumatra Sahih.
2006: Indonesia's most famous island, Java, was hit by a magnitude 6.8 earthquake that killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake devastated dozens of villages on one of the Mentavay islands off the coast of Sumatra, creating 10-meter tsunamis that killed about 300 people.
2016: In the suburbs of Pidi-Jaya in Ajax, there was a light earthquake that reminded people of the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004, causing devastation and panic.
There was no tsunami at the time, but more than 100 people were killed under collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, mainly on the island's northern coast, took place in Lombok, Indonesia's tourist island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily put thousands of tourists in a difficult situation.
Sarah Peyley's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Peylin's eldest son, Trek Peylin, has been arrested on charges of rape.
Wasilla, 29, from Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicts what the Alaska State Police said on Saturday, according to reports of domestic violence and insubordination during detention.
According to police, the woman had taken her cell phone when she called the police to report the alleged crime.
KTUU is mainly located in the Mat-Su investigative detention facility and is maintained on the basis of a $500 non-guaranteed pledge.
When asked about his release from prison on Saturday, he said, "Of course, I'm innocent."
Peylini faces three lighter sentences from Class A, requiring a prison sentence of less than a year, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B fine, spending a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time that criminal charges have been brought against him.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Page.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged rape.
The case is currently under review in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with forgery of a report on domestic violence, domestic violence, and possession of weapons in an alcohol-related incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he shot her because of her.
In 2016, she was criticized by a group of veterans for her son's post-traumatic stress disorder.
Earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia.
An earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday killed at least 384 people.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication lines have been cut, and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake was near the center of Sulavesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are videos on social media that reflect the moment of a stroke.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
The federal prosecutor's office is looking for a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, is a rare death sentence in the state that has not been imposed for federal crimes since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipoz allegedly used a truck he rented from Home Depot to crush pedestrians and cyclists along West Sayd Highway in Lower Manhattan.
In order to justify the death penalty in the South of New York state, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and caused "intentionally" bodily injuries.
According to court documents, both charges may contain a possible death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury sentenced Saipov to 22. This includes eight murder charges, and a charge of violence and the destruction of cars, which federal prosecutors have made to aid in the fraud used in organized crime.
Prosecutors described Saipov's style as "abhorrent, cruel and irrational" and said the attack required considerable planning and preparation.
"Sayfullo Habibullayevic Saipov Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Kleves, Ann-Lure Dekat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Panyucco have caused damage, damage and loss to their families and friends" – in the letter of intent
Five of the victims are tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the last trial of the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug suppliers, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in a federal criminal case in New York was in 1953 for married couples Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed two years earlier after they were accused of secretly conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953.
According to the court's documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, had no remorse in the days and months after the attack.
Police said he did not feel bad about what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, he was eager to carry out the attack.
According to police, he also demanded that the flag of ISIS be displayed in his room at the hospital.
He denied that he was present on the basis of Prosecution No. 22.
David Petton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was clearly disappointed by the court's decision.
"In our opinion, the decision to impose the death penalty, rather than accepting a life sentence without the possibility of being released, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Petton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to apply the death penalty.
According to Tory MPs, the person in charge of the Brexit talks should be Naycel Faraj.
Today, during the protests at the Farage Tori conference, Najcel vowed to "mobilize the army of the people."
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians should feel the pressure from the Euroskeptics because Theresa May said one of her parliamentarians should be appointed as a responsible person in negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bowen, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a rally in Birmingham that if Mr. Faraj was a Brexit secretary, the UK would have been out by now.
But the obstacle Ms. May faced while creating a compromise between her deeply fragmented staff has been particularly emphasized by Tories, who are supporters of the city's stand-off against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep a compromise plan in place between Brexit supporters, opponents, and EU attacks.
Despite the opposition, the Allies insisted that he would continue to move forward by trying to reach an official agreement with Brussels – and pushing the Euroskeptics and the Labour Party to choose between his package and "chaos."
In a statement, Boone said he wanted to give up on the "Separation is Separation" rally in Solihal.
He suggested that Faraj should be appointed a lord and be given an obligation to negotiate with the official Brussels.
He said, “If we had been in charge, we would have already gone out.”
He added: "I will support the Brexit, but we have to give up the Czechs."
He said: "We did not fight to surrender in the world wars.
We want to make sure that our land is secure.”
Boun disagreed with the opinion that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea of the British people changing their minds and wanting to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
Andrea Jenkins, a supporter of Brexit from Tori, told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
There is no sympathy among the people, there is no sympathy for the opposition, there is no sympathy for the activists who march in the streets and, above all, for our party.
Begin by listening to the people and listening to them.
He said: "When they send a message, they send a message to the people, and they send it to the people.
Faraj said the protesters should feel pressured if they are to betray a decision taken during a 2016 referendum.
He said: "This is a matter of trust between our people and our political class.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and today we’re here to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you go unpunished for doing this.’”
He told the crowd: "I want you to feel pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which has given us victory over Brexit, and we will not stand still until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, anti-Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Following the group's march this weekend, a group of activists chanted the slogan "Tories Against Brexit."
When the debate began, Lord Adonis, one of the laborers, mocked the Conservatives for their security problems with the party's application.
"They are people who say that in Ireland, 'Canada plus plus' will be able to leverage all technology and IT systems in a convenient way for an undisputed border, borderless free trade," he added.
"It's completely inconsequential.
There is nothing like Brexit, which is convenient,” he said.
Warren plans to "think deeply" about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe magazine reported that the Massachusetts-based Democrat talked about his future during a meeting at a municipality in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has repeatedly criticized President Donald Trump, is nominating again in November against the Republican Party's Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
He is at the heart of the speculation that he will be able to win Trump in 2020.
The event, held in Holyoke on Saturday, was the 36th meeting in which Trump met with his constituents, mostly in the form of a municipality, after he was elected president.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for the presidency.
In response, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to correct a corrupt government, including a woman in a high position.
As a result of the murder of an LSU player, Sims, a man was arrested.
On Saturday, Louisiana's Baton Lipstick police said a suspect had been arrested in the aftermath of a gunshot wound to LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Lipstick Police Department said 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was detained at a press conference at 11 a.m.
A video of the shooting was circulated on Friday, asking for help in identifying the person who was caught on camera.
Sims, a 20-year-old man, was shot dead on Friday morning near a Southern University camp.
"White Sims was shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
White intervened to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene with a gun and opened fire on White Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Lipstick District Police Department.
Growing 6 feet (1.98 meters) tall in Baton Rouge, the young Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 ricochets per game.
Russian Grand Prix: After the team's tactics helped Sebastian Vettel win, Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship
The moment Valtteri Bottas reached the final before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's tactics would play a big role in the competition.
Bottas had a good start from the pole and almost left Hamilton too far behind, so he kept his position in the first two loops, leading him to attack his teammate.
Fettel first entered the pit-stop and allowed Hamilton to go on the track at the end of the gang, which was supposed to be the decisive moment.
"Mercedes" then hit another round and came behind Fettel, but Hamilton moved forward after very close action maneuvers, which caused the Ferrari driver to leave the odds unintentionally with the threat of continuing after two strikes he had made to protect the third corner.
Max Ferstappen started in the back row of the start line and was in seventh place at the end of the first round at the age of 21.
He was then in the lead for a large part of the race as he kept his wheels to target the fast finish and put them in the 4th place, like bypassing Reykkonne.
In the end, he came to the pit in the 44th round, but was unable to speed up the remaining 8 rounds due to being in the 4th round with Reykkonen.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me pass.
"He did a very unusual job of having two people on the team," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dayan Feinstein for insisting that Christine Blaise Ford had not leaked a letter to the Supreme Court accusing candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, he did not directly address Ford's testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what happened in the Senate shows that people are dishonest, greedy, and liars.
"One thing that can happen in the Senate over the past few days, and the good thing that's going on, is that you see people who are angry, angry, naive, obnoxious, and lying," he said.
"You look at the published and leaked data, and then you say, 'I didn't do that.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Hold on, Feinstein, you've leaked.
Do you remember him saying, “You’re the one who’s the one who’s the one who’s the one who’s the one?”
Not at all.
I didn't leak.
All right, wait a minute.
"We have not, we have not, we have not," he said.
In July, a letter was sent to Fainstein detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh, which was leaked in early September, but Fainstein denied that the leaked information came from his office.
The Hill newspaper reported that Fainstein told the committee: "I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not leak his case."
He asked me to keep it secret, and I kept it as he wanted it to be.
But his denial of these accusations, apparently, did not please the President, who said during a rally on Saturday night, "I'm going to tell you what's really a very bad body language.
It may not be, but it is the worst body language I have ever seen.”
The president, who continues to defend a man who has been accused of sexual abuse by three women and has been nominated by the Supreme Court, has claimed that the Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
"They will definitely be able to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the misery, the hatred, they don't care who they hurt, who they crushed to take power and power," Mediaite wrote, citing the President's words.
Elite League: Dandi Stars 5-3 "Belfast Giants"
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for "Grands" in the match against "Dandy"
The Dandi Stars won a rematch in Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5-3, in return for their loss against the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday.
The "giants" took advantage of the game early with 2 goals with the strikes of Patrick Dunier and Francis Bovilie.
Before Duayer regained the advantage of the Giants, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kauni reached the level of their host team.
Before Lukas Lundwald secured Nielsen's two wins, Bouchard created equality for Dandi.
This was Adam Keef's third-place finish of the season in the Elite League by his backing players to beat Dandi 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides; the Giants had won the previous three matches.
The Duayer's first goal was in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaul; since Buvillee doubled the win four minutes later, David Rutherford created the conditions for this assistance.
During the moving opening, Met Markvardt returned his home team to the game at 13:10 before securing Kauni's equivalency goal at 15:16.
When Duayer scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first half, he ensured that the Giants took the lead in the first break.
The home team regrouped again, and in the 27:37 minute, Bushar left them behind again with a strong goal.
To help Nilsen lead Dandi for the first time at the end of the second half, Kauni and Charles Korkoran merged and secured his team's victory in half of the final.
Four of the last five matches have already been won, and the Giants are heading home to Milton Kins in the next match, which will be held on Friday.
The airliner was killed in an attempt to rescue hundreds of people on board the plane.
In Indonesia, an aviator was praised as a hero after he died while enabling hundreds of people to safely land on the ground.
More than 800 people have been killed and a large number have gone missing in the aftermath of a massive earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The aftermath of the earthquake continues to create problems, and many people are trapped under the rubble in Palu.
Unlike his colleagues, who escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Antony Gunavan did not leave his seat at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport near Palu.
He did not move to ensure that the "Batik Air-6321" aircraft, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped down, thinking that the dispatcher tower had collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
ABC News' Australian office said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Johannes Sirait, the press secretary of the Indonesian air navigation service.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are very saddened to hear about this," he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach several thousand, with the country's disaster risk reduction agency saying that access to Dongqala, Siqi and Button will be restricted.
"While most bodies have not been found, the death toll is expected to continue to rise as most of them are still in ruins," said the agency's press secretary, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
Waves as high as six metres have destroyed Palin, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft bring food and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: "The ambulance brings corpses every minute.
Clean water is hard to find.
They are the ones who are all over the place.”
Jan Galfand, head of the International Red Cross office in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is trying to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a bad thing, but it could have been worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every mission related to the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
A micronesian plane crash: Now a man is missing after a plane crash in the Lagos Air Niugin
The airline, which operates the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, says one person is missing after it previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini, as of Saturday afternoon, the man had not been able to determine the location and condition of the passenger.
The company said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the person.
The company did not immediately respond to questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane crashed while attempting to land at Truk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were staying at the hospital on Saturday and all of them were in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and the incidents.
The company and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed outside the lakh flight lane.
Some witnesses said the plane had crossed the line.
U.S. Air Force said the plane was coming from far down the road.
“This is a good thing,” he said.
According to Janet, he and the others were able to move so much power in the water that they were about to sink, moving towards their reserve exit.
He said that the people on the plane were alarmed and screamed and took a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy's sailors, who were busy fixing the port in the vicinity, also helped with the rescue effort by using inflatable boats to take people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in accidents in Papua New Guinea over the past 20 years, but none of them have been Air Niugini.
The woman's body was found the night she was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution paused the trial to reconsider the case of a woman from Mississippi who was accused of burning a woman in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice investigator Paul Roulet testified for hours as an expert witness in the analysis of intelligence data.
He described how the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chamberlain, used cell phone records to gather together what he had done the night he died.
The Clarion Ledger magazine quoted Roulet as saying that on the night of Circle's death, he received information from several mobile phones indicating Tellis was with him and where he was, which contradicts Tellis' previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was somewhere with Circle’s — he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time — the policeman went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he lied and that his car was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had met Circles about two weeks before he died.
The phone numbers showed that they had met just a week before.
According to Roulett, some time after Circle's death, Tellis deleted his messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
He said, “He’s the one who saved his life.”
The final hearings on the defense are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would be brought to the jury at the end of the day.
"The High Breed": What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The triple hip-hop group wants to eliminate the negative look of this genre by enriching the music it plays with positive messages.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip-hop is moving away from the origins of political messages and fighting social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of this genre and re-popularize conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently seen a revival in the United Kingdom through performers such as Akala and Louki.
There's another black one?!
A New York nanny is suing the couple for being fired after a "racial" message
The New York nanny sues the couple for having been fired for discrimination after receiving a misdirected message from the birth complaining about her being "another black man."
The couple is accused of blackmailing the couple, claiming that they are racists.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was alarmed when she learned that her new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black on the day she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
But instead of sending this message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
Plasco-Flaxman, who "worryed" after realizing his mistake, fired Morisi, saying that they had not done well with the work of their African-American nannies who had quit their job and were waiting for someone from the Philippines instead.
After a day's work, they called for a taxi to Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for his dismissal, and for six months, the $350 a day compensation demands that he stay where he was previously employed—but without a contract.
He said in an interview with the newspaper on Friday: "I want to show them that you don't do these things. I know that it's discriminatory."
The couple reacted to the allegations that they were racists, fearing they might not be able to trust him after he was insulted, saying that the termination of Maurice's case was a logical step.
"My wife sent me a message that she didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists," said her husband, Joel Plasco, in a newspaper.
"Would you leave your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if they've made a mistake?"
"Your newborn baby?
And it is good."
Plasco compared the claim to "blackmail," saying that his wife gave birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Do you want to pursue someone like that?"
This is not a good sign, it is a bad sign."
While the court case is still ongoing, the public opinion court immediately criticized the couple for their behavior and logic on social media.
According to a new letter, Paddington publishers feared that readers would not be able to understand the month in which they spoke.
Bond's daughter Karen Yankee, who was born after the book was accepted, said: "It's hard to imagine someone reading the book for the first time before it was published.
It is a great pleasure to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
Her daughter, who worked for the BBC as a quinoa operator before being inspired to write a children's book with a little toy bear, said that her father could be an optimist about the rejection of the book, adding that the sadness after the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a mixed joy after her death last year.
Speaking about Paddington, who said he was a very important member of his family, Karen said she was very proud of her father's recent success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he was not arrogant.
But since Paddington was too real for him, it was almost like having a child who had achieved something: you were proud of him even if it wasn't true.
I think that's how he saw the success of Paddington.
It was his work and his imagination, but Paddington himself would always praise him.”
My daughter is on the verge of dying, and I have to thank her on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was urgently taken to Nietzsche's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors were trying to save her life in vain.
He said: "It's a terrible thing for him to not be expecting him to do it," and he said, "It's a bad thing for him to be expecting him to do it."
"Then Nad called me to tell me he was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to thank him."
I did that.
I said, "I love you, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave him to keep his heart beating gradually disappeared and left his body.
He died a long time ago, and it was over.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I was in a situation where I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and people.
I have all my senses.”
Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, who lamented the loss of her daughter so far, forgot to take this difficult test and finally boarded the plane with the other passengers.
He said: "No one knows.
I had to keep my head down and my tears flowed.
It's hard to explain, but I felt Nadine's pain when I was on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.”
Women's rights activists are trying to stop suicides in the country
Two women who lost loved ones in suicide attempt to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Hamfrieds left inspiring messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 when she started suffering from depression and killed herself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any other parent to feel like I should be feeling every day," she said.
Davis, a 45-year-old woman from Lidni, said her son was a bright future chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him for his laughter.
They said, “He laughs, he laughs, he laughs.”
But before he died, he quit his job because he was in a really dark place.
The man who found Tyler after killing himself in 2014 was his 11-year-old brother.
She said: "I am worried that I will have a chain effect.
Ms. Davis has made these announcements so that people who can walk around and talk about them – even if this is a friend – know that they are.
"Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Mrs. Hamfries, who had been friends with Mrs. Davis for years, lost her 15-year-old partner, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
“He did not say that he was evil, sad, or how he felt,” she said.
"Two days before Christmas, we saw a change in his condition.
On Christmas day he was at the bottom of the rock – when the children opened their presents, he did not look at them or anything else.”
Hamfries said that death was a great trauma to them, but they have to deal with it: "It's destroying your family.
That's going to shock us.
We all have to fight and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy as the FBI's investigation begins
"I thought that if we had gotten what he really wanted - an investigation being carried out in a timely, scale-limited manner - we could have formed a unity, perhaps even a little," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would collapse in a desperate situation with deep-rooted supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reason for their unwillingness is completely timing.
The midterm elections, which will be held on November 6, are only five weeks away – if the Republicans' situation is as bad as expected, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to ensure that the person they want is elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and spoke to them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What Happens After the FTC Report Is Published?
There will be 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the Senate.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and certify that he leads the Supreme Court.
The number of people fleeing North Korea has been "reduced" by the government.
A South Korean politician says the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byong-seok said in a statement that 1,127 people fled the country last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
According to Park, the harsh border control between North Korea and Shin and the high prices imposed by human smugglers are key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any official statement on the matter.
The vast majority of those who fled the North were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people escape through China, which is the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross from the heavily defended Deserted Zone (HZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly takes them back to their countries of origin.
And in the months that followed, they were in a state of great distress, and they were in a state of great distress.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss issues rooted in delaying talks on the elimination of nuclear weapons.
This took place in June after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where a broad agreement was reached to work on the elimination of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, said the reason for the lack of progress has been because of U.S. sanctions.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot rely on our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not, unilaterally, put weapons first," Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "isteric," saying she is not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, who ran for the Supreme Court's nomination, called Kavanaugh "ambiguous" and said he was not qualified to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this during an interview at the Texas Trial Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman ever did something like this, they would say she was hysterical — I couldn't get that thought out of my head," Pelosi said on Friday about Kavanaugh's attitude toward the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied accusations of sexual assault by Christine Blaise Forda when she was a teenager.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh spoke quite emotionally, almost screaming at times, and excited as his family talked about his years in high school.
He also publicly criticized the committee's accusations, calling them "a ridiculous and coordinated crime" organized by liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way the Clintons go to the Democrats," he said.
When asked if he would try to incriminate Kavanaugh in front of the court, Pelosi hesitated, although his resignation was confirmed and the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say this – if he doesn’t tell Congress and the FBI the truth, then not only would he be in the Supreme Court, not even the court he is in at the moment, is not fit to stand like that,” Pelosi said.
Cavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is deeply concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the "Rou, v. Wade" case, as he is thought to be a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh declined to answer questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It's not the time for a biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it great?' " Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It's just that the anger that has accumulated over the years and months is justifiable, and he can't get out of it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Mrs. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
He continued: "A woman who worked together as an executive officer helped me a lot. She also said that when she got angry she cried, but created a method. So when she got angry and started crying, she told her companion, "You might think I'm sad because I cried.
But I'm angry."
And then he just continued his conversation.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to flow, in part, as anger comes out, because it is largely misunderstood.
One of the most memorable moments in my first job – at the men’s office – was when I cried in a once-in-a-lifetime rage, an old woman – a cold-blooded manager I had always been a little afraid of – grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry.
They don't know you're angry.
They will think that you are sad and they will be pleased because they are the ones who made you angry.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
When Hart was caught off-road on a ship called "Monkey Business" in 1987, and withdrew his candidacy, Schroeder was greatly disappointed and thought there was no reason for him not to investigate the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-planned decision.
There were seven other candidates in the presidential race, and the last thing they needed was an extra one.
Someone called it "Your Brain and Seven Dwarves" – he told me that 30 years later, laughing.
Because it was too late for the campaign, he was behind to raise money, so he promised not to enter the race until he had raised $2 million.
It was a fight that was unlikely to win.
He realized that some of his supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give him $250.
"Do they think that I have been deprived?" he wondered.
When he said that he would not launch an official campaign, he was so enraged by his feelings – his gratitude for the people who supported him, his frustration with the system that made it very difficult for him to raise money and target voters, rather than his representatives – that he could not speak.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to him.
You'd think my corporate sponsor was "Kleenex."
I remember thinking I couldn't wait to see what they were going to put in the graveyard.
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be beneficial to Beijing
The opening fires of the trade war between the U.S. and China were alarming, and experts believe that while the end of the war may be a distant possibility, the conflict between the two countries could be useful for the official Beijing for a long time.
U.S. President Donald Trump made his first warning earlier this year by taxing China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most noticeable strain came with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) this week, effectively taxing half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
The official Beijing has always responded in the same way, last but not least by placing tariffs of 5-10% on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the U.S. in the same way, and it is unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will soon break its promise.
Disassociating Washington from the official idea would be a compromise on the demands, but openly submitting to the United States would be too difficult for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that the official Beijing could well appreciate the opportunity, and pressure from the U.S.-led trade war could positively support China for a long time, reducing the interdependence of the two countries' economies.
"The fact that urgent political decision-making in either Washington or Beijing could lead to economic turmoil in one of the two countries is actually far more dangerous than what viewers have previously admitted," said Abiqail Grays, an Asian scientist at the New America Security Center.
Syria's foreign minister says it's "ready" to return refugees
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees voluntarily and asks for help to rebuild a country that has been devastated by the war for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Minister Valid al-Mualim said that conditions in the country have improved.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
In order to restore the normal situation, the government continues to restore the areas that were destroyed by terrorists.
There are all the conditions for a voluntary return to unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and means of living, as well as countries where refugees must leave due to terrorism.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
The remaining six million people in the country are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualim said the regime in Syria would welcome assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he said he would not accept the necessary assistance or assistance from the countries that supported the uprising.
Europe's Rider Championship wins in Paris
In a match outside Paris, France, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Championship, defeating the US team with 10.5 points.
The U.S. lost for the sixth time in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Championship in Europe since 1993.
The Danish captain Thomas Björn's team recaptured the advantage when they reached the 14.5 ties needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mikelson, who competed in most of the tournament, handed over his start-up shot to Francesco Molinari, throwing it into the water in the 16th hole in the Par-3.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all rounds as one of four players to have achieved 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by 5 and 4 by Torborn Olesen, the lowest-ranked player on the European team.
World high-profile player Dustin Johnson lost to England's Ian Polter, who played perhaps his last game in the Ryder Championship, to a 2nd and 1st place.
8 Ryder Championship veteran Spanyard Sergio García, with 25.5 points in his career, has become the most-winning European of the tournaments to date.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't control myself today.
It's been a tough year.
Thank you for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I got the puck back.
"It's a team issue and I'm happy to have touched my hand," García said after the European victory.
He gave the torch to his young colleague John Rema, who defeated the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods in a single game held on Sunday with a score of 2 and 1.
"I was incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this person," said 23-year-old John Rem.
Wood lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record for the Ryder Championship in his career.
It's a strange indicator for the shah, who is the second person to receive 14 important titles after Jack Niklaus, and is considered one of the greatest players of all time.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find the "fairways," with the exception of Patrick Rid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the entire tournament.
After a disappointing performance for the U.S. team, Captain Jim Fury said: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we went to Europe.
We have struggled.
Congrats to Tom.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, work with our PGA American and Rayder Championship Committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 people and I'm proud to serve as a captain.
You have to congratulate yourself.
We are out of the game."
