I'll be here tonight.
I will sit here for about 2:30 p.m.
I will be in Australia next week.
I am with you every step of the way.
I’ll buy you a cup of coffee at the cafeteria.
I have to go and see what I can do.
I don't want to talk to my friends
I have given you permission to go.
I might do exactly what Tom did.
I’ll set aside some for us to drink tea
I'll keep going until you change your clothes.
I looked for my wife, but I couldn't find her.
I love the Internet.
I may not be able to love you.

I tell you, I am starving.
I’m just sitting there listening to music.
I listen to music.
I'm more than a friend.
I'm not a doctor.
I Am Not ‘A Sluggish Person’
I am not unreasonable.
I'm not from Brazil.
I would be embarrassed if I showed Germany my finger on the map!
I'm not going to read this book.
I have a busy evening.
I am not too old.
I am not sure if Tom is in Boston or not.
I'm not sure she'll do it.
I'm not your teacher anymore.
I'm not your teacher anymore.
I moved to Australia last winter.
I'm drunk.
This time, I am moved.
He's a jerk!
I am filled with joy.
I know how much Tom loved her.
I know they will not allow us to do this.
I'm pretty sure he didn't.
I am truly happy.”
I am afraid that you may come nearer to the power of your hand.
I was sick and tired from exhaustion.
As it is, I don’t know what to do.
Sorry, I didn't understand.
I apologized for the delay, but my lips did not stick together.
I’m sorry I had to cancel the meeting.
I'm sorry I didn't help you much.
Unfortunately, I couldn't be of much help.
I’m sorry I couldn’t be of any help to you
His physical condition made him very sad.
“I know Mary is very ill.
I know.
I am sure that Tom and John were very busy.
I'm the one who built this house.
It is I who joins us in this war.
I'm the one who built this.
I told her that she should learn French.
I'm a Dentist.
I have a lot of work to do for dinner tonight
I'm really tired tonight
I have to go in.
I need to pay attention.
I owe it to myself.
I should get in.
I must have made a mistake.
In 2013, Tom moved to Boston.
I need a cab!
I need medical attention.
I need someone.
I have to be ready before Tom and Mary arrive.
I must get back to the girl’s house.
I need you right here and right here.
I'm not really on your side.
I never should have listened to you.
Squeeze in.
Drink a little.
Gyzyk.
Finally, we got what we wanted.
I opened the box for the cancer, but it was empty.
When I asked Tom for forgiveness
I have left my wife’s eyelashes by mistake.
I read a book.
I really wanted to do that with you two.
I really want you to get to know them.
I have fond memories of Tom and Mary as they were small children.
I saw him in the mirror, so I came back and said hello.
There I saw Tom inside.
I saw Tomy at the club last weekend.
I saw Tom go.
I saw him walking down the street.
I saw Tom’s birth certificate.
I saw pictures of Tom.
I noticed that Tom had stolen something from the bag.
I saw that Tom had taken your keys.
I saw that Tom was about to kiss you.
I saw Tomy Mary last night.
Yesterday, I saw Tom, and he looked sad.
I saw Tomy yesterday morning.
I saw what had happened.
I saw what it was.
I saw you crying.
I saw Tom's face.
I saw you on TV.
I saw you last Monday.
So I say, go.
I saw a red light.
It’s when I see myself.
I don't know how else to do it.
Is everything set/programed for tomorrow?
I have to go back to the city and talk to the boy.
I had to advise Thomas not to wait.
I expected Tom to do something like this.
I had to explain everything to Tom.
Have all these things now been resolved?
Is it possible?
Can I come too?
Is it true that you built it?
Is that not his friend?
Isn’t he our friend?
I spent a lot of time learning French.
Is this all for you?
Is this something for you?
Is that the real reason he does not like you?
Is that too much for you?
Would he become ill?
Is there a place in the area where I can rent a bicycle?
Is there something I would like to say?
Is there a place for a thousand in your vehicle?
Wouldn’t that be too short?
Is this window always locked?
This wine is goumy?
I still feel very strongly.
Is Tom allergic to any of these?
The only one who knew how to do it, Tommy?
I studied French for three years.
I really miss Tom
I thought that it would be futile because of my doubts.
Is it your mother's home now?
I am.
It belongs to me.
You cannot do it all alone.
It did not take long for Thomas to do so.
Every week, I teach a French lesson to one of my friends.
One time a week I taught my friends a lesson in French.
I once a week trained my friends in French.
I teach Tom’s children French three times a week.
All of this was a mistake.
All of this was a shocking mistake
That has happened long ago.
That was over a year ago.
The answer is obvious.
I thought doing so would help me.
I believe that everyone needs to learn a new language.
I expect they would have done it on their own.
I think I need a couple of examples.
I think I’ll go and see Tom and Mary and ask them what they think.
I think he is a happy boy.
I feel like I'm going deeper into it.
But it's not worth the risk.
I think that needs to be done.
I think it's just a small part of a chain.
I think it's a small fraction of that.
I think that's a very unlikely question.
I hope Tom can help Mary.
I wonder if Tom does not have to do this again.
I really thought that Tom was a good son.
I think Tom will be fine.
I think Tom is good.
I think Tom will be one of the winners.
I think it's Tom.
And I think Tom Meria is calling.
I think Tom will call Mary.
I don't think Tom would be the last person to do that.
I'm sure Tom would agree to that.
I think Tom and Mary are too young to be dating.
I don’t think Tom believed me.
I think Tom will let us do that.
I think we're going to go back soon.
I do say that you do not know that Tom will not be here today.
I assure you, I do not know if Tom will be here today.
You must have been wise, I suppose.
I don't think you're going to go to a high school.
I thought that I would be fine.
I thought it would be good.

Mars is reportedly on an uptrend.
It was forbidden to translate that word.

Today, Tom feels like he won’t be here anymore.
It can take years.
Do not say that I will help you.
I told you to stop talking to me at all.
I have translated.
I am not translating just for my own benefit.
I got tired of explaining it to Tom.
I'm trying to test.
I try to travel with only one suitcase.
It is now 2:30.

At times, it may be difficult to reach my destination.
Light began to shine.
Only the monthly magazine is available.
It's Friday.
Tomorrow is Tom’s 30th birthday.
It Is a Whole Failure
The whole year is here, May.
It was in the summer.
The temptation was severe.
He had arrived early in the morning.
That's funny, that's funny.
That was my first kiss.
How happy I was to meet you!
It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.
The weather was bad.
This was the most important thing for Tom to do.
Imagine the disappointment that would have been if Tom had done so.
I used it in the summer in China, where he died.
I came to Boston a month ago.

I didn't do anything else.
I am interested.
I need to call Tom.
I know him because we went to school together.
I have never forgotten Tom’s birthday.
I have never seen anyone better than Tom.
I had never seen Mary and Tom do that before.

I was angry.
On the day of Tom's birth, I was a second year student at a university.
I was blinded by the light of day.
I was born and raised in Matsuyama.
I felt guilty.
By the time my son was born, he was halfway to Boston.
I thought, ‘There are a lot of questions I would have answered.’
I have been in London.
Anna said, "I want to invite you to join me in celebrating my birthday on Saturday."
I could not wait for my guests.
It wasn't me.
I did not have much to do today.
I was with Tom.
I Was Angry
I kept putting it on my face.
I stopped talking about it.
We were told to see a doctor.
I've been watching TV.
I looked at you.
I went to Paris.
I’ll see to it.
I can do that.
I will come.
I don't want you to think about it all of a sudden.
I didn't know how to explain it to her.

It's like you're going to be stuck in a hole, and you're going to be able to pull it off again.

I'll try it.
I will try.
I wish I was punctual, though.
I want to be a doctor.
I want Tom and Mary to be part of the group.
Tom and Mary could easily have been in our group.
And I want to see how technology -- the Internet, mobile phones, and digitalization -- can impact on people's privacy and politics.
I wonder if it will snow tomorrow.
I want to know whether Tom and Mary really learned or not the French language.
I'm a fan of the Toy Story, but I'm a fan of the Toy Story.
For the first time, I won a gold medal.
I don't turn to Tom.
I'm curious about that thing.
I will not die.
I wouldn’t do that, though, if Tom and Mary were going to do it.
I do not have time on Monday or Tuesday.
I won't let him.
I won't take your money
Don’t tell her
I would not tell them that.
I often work from home.
I worked late last night.

You can, in no way, confuse the sound of a child’s voice.
You have the freedom to make your own choices without fear of being judged.
You may expect more of him.
Don't go in there.

That is, you know, a way of life.
You know what that is, don't you?
You know what it is, don't you?
You will succeed.
To you, this lesson may seem simple.
It may be that you need some of these.
You will likely need it.
You can start right now
You look fabulous.
You've lost your mind.
You may impress me, but you will never impress him more with your way of life.
Did you meet him at the university?

You feel better, don’t you?
Well, that's right.
You're too far away from me.
You could not be downstairs.
You’re the only people I know who like to get up early.
You're the only one I know of who like to get up in the morning.
Normally, you are too much for me to handle.
Didn’t you rewrite this?
Your website is visualized well.
You said you needed help.
You were about to give the answers.
You seem self-confident.
You may need to reassure yourself.
Tom let him do it.
You have to admit that you can't do it now.

That's how it should be.

You're sitting in front of a mirror.
You were the one who did it, weren’t you?
You can’t believe what I’ve found today.
You would not have done this if Tom and Mary had been there.
If Tom had helped you, you would not have been so preoccupied.
You might as well minimize the number, and we'll see.
