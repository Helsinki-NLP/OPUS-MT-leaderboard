28-Year-Old Cook Found Dead in San Francisco Shopping Mall
The 28-year-old cook, who had recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother said he didn't think there was anyone who might have wanted to harm him, saying, "In the end, things were going well for him."
The San Francisco Forensic Medicine Authority said Wednesday morning that the body found at the Westfield Mall was identified as belonging to a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department says the cause of death has been determined and investigations are ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as the chef of the kitchen department in Boston, got his dream job six months earlier and began working as the chef of the San Francisco Sons <0x26> Daughters kitchen department.
A Sons <0x26> Daughters official said the death "brought them to a state of shock and they are extremely sad."
“We’re a small team here that works like a tight family and he’ll be very missed,” he said.
During this difficult time, we want to tell Frank’s family that they are not alone and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank was initially staying in hostels and that "in the end things were going well for him."
Louis Galicia told KGO that he had rented an apartment and was dating a girl.
Louis Galicia says he doesn't think there's anyone who might want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a big heart.
The way to connect with the family was always to make us a plate, to cook us," said Louis Galicia.
He didn't like to argue.
My brother would adapt to any situation.
“When everything else in the world went wrong, it was that unworked diamond that glittered every day,” he said.
People with information were asked to call the SFPD Notification Line at 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors on strike: calls for new job slowdown
Representatives of assistant doctors have asked their unions to allow work to be slowed down in connection with a dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Assistant Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on the general council to support further job slowing from the beginning of September.
JDC said ministers were unable to address concerns about the contract.
Assistant physicians and medical students voted in rejection in a contract agreement with BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of voters.
In a post posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC president Ellen McCourt said the government remained "continuously silent" about the issues that led to the rejection of the contract.
"In light of this, the JDC Board of Directors voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and called for a resumption of formal negotiations on concerns," he said.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC administration made an official request for the BMA Board to allow a program to boost job slowdown from early September.
The dispute prompted assistant doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first total cut in NHS history.
Assistant physician leader Dr. Johann Malawana has resigned after the BMA's proposed contract terms were voted down.
During the meetings before 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students voted, he told BMA members that this was a good deal to accept.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would apply to doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: an "incompatible alliance"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war, waged by words and economic sanctions.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the splendid hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I had the obvious impression that Ankara was the one who wanted this compromise the most.
He shook his hand, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile was rather weak, and his own limited standards did not radiate any warmth.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has repeatedly referred to Mr. Putin as his "good friend", five times according to a report.
I was surprised by the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to pre-crisis levels, but will reach much higher levels.
The next day, a newspaper here stated that Mr. Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was acting as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement was the opposite.
But Mr. Putin’s cold outlook showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet at the Syrian border.
At the time, Russia’s response was outrageous.
Mr. Putin made a tough exit, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The resentment was much greater, the other side was supposed to be friendly.
It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to rebuild trust in the true sense of the word.
Since November, the Russian people have changed their minds.
State-controlled media have been targeting Ankara for months in a shocking and aggressive manner.
Suddenly, the Turks were to blame for everything.
The most serious of these were accusations of high-ranking officials that Mr. Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's family was profiting from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He rejected it with certainty.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move on.
Ultimately, the reason this meeting took place was because Mr. Putin had received an apology from President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
Russia sees this as a victory.
The benefits of calling for a ceasefire for Ankara are clear.
First, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an needs friends after the failed coup that took place last month and almost caused his ouster.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also affected him greatly.
Economic reasons are also effective.
The sanctions imposed by Russia have been tightly curtailed, particularly the ban on special flights with several million Russian tourists to Turkey’s coastal regions each year.
That number has fallen almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies are also absolutely relieved that the flights will continue.
They depend on the end-of-season intensity in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables if Turkish agricultural products were allowed to be imported again.
To quote a story in the Vedemosti newspaper, "Tourists here, tomatoes here".
However, the visit also had a distinct political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for not finding enough response to the coup attempt.
Adding to his long-standing resentment over the progress of talks on joining the United States at the speed of snails, Mr. Putin, who wants to take advantage of Turkey's rupture with the West and the friction between them, comes into play.
The Russian leader certainly seems to have gathered sympathy from Ankara because of the call for the support of elected officials after the coup attempt.
It should not be forgotten that this was an inevitable attitude for Moscow, who himself had a deep fear of regime change.
This summit, held in this flamboyant palace by the sea, represents a “alignment of incompatible” between Russia and Turkey, as an analyst has explained to me: two countries, rejected and mistreated by the West, unite their forces.
Yet despite this display of conciliation, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important of these is Syria: Russia and Turkey support different sides, even though Moscow presents itself as a mediator.
After nearly three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said they had not touched on the issue at a press conference.
While the President of Turkey openly refrained from answering a question about these differences, Mr. Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on how to determine the common ground in Syria.
But after months of clearly maintained hostility – and given the potential for an absolute disaster resulting from NATO member Turkey’s downing of a Russian fighter jet – it’s definitely a good development that the two leaders at least start talking.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside of Scotland
According to the statement of the head of the executive board of the bank, the RBS brand will move to a back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global goals.
Eight years ago, when he was almost sinking, he had to retreat and give up.
During this time, brand strategists used ‘RBS’ to protect other consumer finance brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for many sponsorships, from the Six Nations rugby championships to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
But now it has been decided that it would be right for more national brands to stand out.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but no new beginnings will be made.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands that will take on a much more dominant role for individual banking; Coutts, Adam <0x26> Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview on a tour in Inverness-shire for clients and staff.
The BBC told Scotland: “As we will be a bank of more brands from now on, the RBS brand will no longer be our investor brand and the brand where our staff will be employed.”
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying that we no longer have global, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand out a little differently in the community they are in, and our staff will work with customers on behalf of these brands.
RBS announced that it would not continue to sponsor the Six Nations Championships and is raising the profile of different brands on sports sponsorship.
"It's time to move on to the understanding of brands bank because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make this a better bank for customers?"
If we had mentioned three years ago that we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would be offering these brands, I would have found it sarcastic.
But I think you will see a lot of changes with the work we do and our focus on the needs of customers, not our own.
We can reactivate these brands, so I think this is the right time.
Frankie Dettori wins for the 3,000th time with Predilection at Newmarket
Dettori burst champagne after his 3,000th victory with double success at Newmarket
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory in Newmarket on Friday.
On his local track, he reached this milestone, winning his second victory of the night with the Predilection, which John Gosden had trained.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in an unhindered run.
He follows in the footsteps of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The jockey, who previously won three championships in Ghayyar, said: "This is a special case."
I'm so touched that my family is here.
I'm really happy to have this at Newmarket, where I started 30 years ago.
This is not an important meeting, not a Royal Ascot – just an ordinary Friday night with 20,000 people.
I feel lightened and relieved.
Dettori accepts cheers by bringing Predilection after victory
Two jockeys reached this milestone in the hurdle run: the champion, Richard Johnson, and the retired jockey, Sir Anthony McCoy, who has won more than 4,300 titles in his 20-time champion career.
Lester Piggott, who won the Derby nine times, has won 4,493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it’s no surprise that only a few people before him have reached a milestone.
He is a stylish and strong person, but his tactical mentality is the element that makes the scales outweigh the others.
He represents the horse race in an extraordinary way and has attracted people to this sport for years with his enthusiasm and charisma.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that he might have won his 6,000th victory if he wasn't just a jockey on weekends and big races.
Seriously, Frankie has spent most of his 30 years racing in the United Kingdom in victories, which is great to see.
He has a very exciting character and this is a great feature for British racing, but beyond that, he is an outstanding jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrates this milestone with an iconic jump jump
With many movements ranging from jumping races to jumping landings, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British unhindered running for twenty years.
This was a road full of ups and downs.
In 1996, he survived a plane crash and was banned for not complying with the drug ban, while winning many major races, including the famous 'Big Seven' victory at Ascot.
Three years ago, he showed a strong character that, although he had initially struggled during his return from this six-month suspension, he had the strength to justify those who suspected him and return to his best form.
And it could go on for a while; Dettori had previously stated that he wanted to continue racing until he was at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin dismisses special secretary Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was part of Mr. Putin’s close circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport issues.
In a statement issued by the Kremlin, Mr. Putin said that he had "decided to end Ivanov's position as Russia's chief executive", but no reason was given.
Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy to Mr. Ivanov since 2012, was appointed for this position.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the International Relations (MGIMO) department of the well-known Moscow State Institute and served in the Tokyo embassy.
He then took care of the presidential protocol and the administration of government staff; the statements on the Kremlin website are like this (in Russian).
After his appointment, he told Mr. Putin: “Thank you for trusting me.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in order to enact laws and oversee the implementation of instructions.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that he had asked Mr. Ivanov to step down and recommended Mr. Vaino to take his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that shocked Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov had long served as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, and Soviet security forces, like him, had served the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country as a special agent.
During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, both said that the prime minister had voluntarily resigned.
But despite the smiley poses given to the cameras, very few people here are convinced of this, especially during this time of near parliamentary elections.
Is this a conflict of some sort of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official announcement that a person who could become president would suddenly want to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with great suspicion.
According to a quote on the Kremlin website, Mr. Ivanov said to Mr. Putin: "It is true that in a speech at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to trust me for four years for this difficult — or even problematic — task.
Well, apparently, I've been president's chief of staff for four years, eight months.
Mr. Ivanov assumed this position in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces, such as Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Mr. Putin was the head of the Federal Security Forces (FSB) that replaced the KGB, Mr. Ivanov was acting as his deputy.
When Putin took power, Ivanov was listed as one of the five people he trusted the most.
Since Mr. Putin's presidency in the third term was unconstitutional, Mr. Ivanov was thought to be able to become president after Mr. Putin's second term.
However, this task was transferred to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin was prime minister three and a half years before he returned to the presidency.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a physical fight last month on the set of the show in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint statement that they had fired him.
Gibson, who portrays Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology on Tuesday ahead of the termination announcement.
There were differences and disagreements about creative issues on the set.
"I am sorry that such an event has happened," he said in a statement.
A statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios says details on how Gibson's character will be removed from the program following a group of FBI agents will be provided at a later date.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously appeared in the sitcom Dharma <0x26> Greg, has been on the show since his first season in 2005.
In a statement released Friday, Gibson said, “I love Criminal Minds and have worked for the past twelve years with my heart and soul in giving it.”
I'd like to stay until the end, but that's not possible anymore.
I just want to thank the authors, producers, actors, our great team, and most importantly, the best supporters a program can have.
The show is expected to return to screens for the twelfth season on September 28.
The Mystery of the Banff Garden
A person living in the Banff area has applied for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks these 75 fish could be sandfish carried by a sea hose.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, posted the images on Periscope in hopes that someone could shed light on the emergence of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Pass: The bridge is now connected to Fife
Project worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion needs to be completed by May 2017
Engineers combined the north of the Queensferry Pass and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the “fans of the practice” that are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The cross section of the bridge from Fife is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown became one of the first people to walk from land to bridge by visiting the facilities today.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Pass.
We are all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale with this project, which uses over 30,000 tons of concrete to build only this part of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge, which closes the gap between the viaduct and the bridge plate, it is a delicate operation that requires extremely precise tolerances for this fit.
In general, almost 79% of the total bridge plateau is settled, with the concrete casting of the first section of the plateau being carried out today in Rosyth, which means that the entire plateau will be ready for lifting on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of Forth Pass and Bridge Contractors project, said: “In all bridge projects, the first closure is always an important milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents a pioneer in civil engineering.
After the last highway plateau was also placed and connected to the expanding North Tower level, we had to close the gap on the north or land side.
This was done by pulling the northern viaduct about 700 millimeters south.
This was a very big but also very sensitive operation.
The reason it was large was because the viaduct was 222 meters long, weighing almost 6,000 tons, and had to be pulled at a slope of about 3%.
The reason for its precision was that the tolerance values the team had to match were very low, only a few millimeters on both sides.
Thankfully, everything went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: Three men 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are "lucky to have survived" after they fell off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station issued an alarm Friday at 13:20, British summer time, after the unit saw the case at Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim towards a safe area as their boat continued on its own.
Moelfre, the lifeboat controller, said: “We saw the boat circling towards them, and we were worried.”
He said, “We’re going to have to wait until we get to them.”
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a 60-year-old third man was found stranded in a float without a lifejacket.
They were all taken to the coastal lifeboat and brought to the lifeboat station.
Mr Jones said: “Three men who fell into the water are lucky to be alive and not injured at all.
There was an emergency stop cable on the boat engine, but it must have been somehow disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the boat flipped.
Someone was watching these three guys today.
A valuable type of hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It’s really amazing to see how the world has changed.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time staring at screens, has been a sad reality for many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to get up from the couch.
The time spent looking at the screens was limited to television at first, but over time it spread to video games and finally to smartphones.
So it’s really great to see that technology and outdoor movement are not mutually exclusive elements.
Of course, I’m talking about Pokémon Go, an app based primarily on characters created for video game in the 90s (which later turned into cartoons, game cards, and other byproducts).
Like many cases of popular culture, this new game was a mess when it was introduced in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Subsequently, the presentation was postponed in other countries due to intense interest in causing overload on the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go reached more users than Tinder and almost the same number as Twitter.
So how does it work?
To put it simply, players take their smartphones, go out to search for Pokémon in the way they are tracked by GPS, and can 'take' photos of what they find (by taking screenshots on the phone) or 'catch' them.
He joined this madness by stepping out of the couch in search of a generation who played the game at a younger age.
In the U.S., the game saw a significant increase in the number of steps a “average” person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for the Apple Watch that tracked 35,000 users, recently reported that the proportion of people who followed the game to the Washington Post increased from 45 percent to 53 percent who exercised for 30 days every day during the two days following it.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go; it can only see raw data at the exercise level.
Most public health campaigns that encourage people to "take 30 minutes", "get out of the couch" and "be active every day" have been ignored because most public health messages are boring and transmitted by those who seem to be miserable.
However, the importance of exercise is still understated.
People who exercise regularly are less likely to have cancer or depression.
Exercise provides help with things like weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and it has a long list of benefits that cannot be listed here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, three key elements of health are met: movement, fresh air and entertainment with sunlight.
Some people can even make new friends during hunting.
As usual, there are some faceless gamers looking for something to complain about.
And, of course, someone can hit the door while walking.
What's the difference?
A great innovation was presented.
While smartphone apps like Fitbit tracked our movement, it didn’t give us a reason to exercise like this game.
The impact of innovation will pass and usage will decrease over time.
But due to Pokémon’s success, many games will be released that help people hunt through apps and combining virtual reality with real-world activities to become more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics overall
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic about jumping.
It's comfortable on the balancer.
Surprising on the ground.
Perfection at the beginning.
He is now an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast also finished the overall assessment first on Thursday, demonstrating clearly the difference between himself and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
With a total of 62,198 points, he was far above Aly Raisman, a silver medalist and friend of the "Last Five" team, and Aliya Mustafina, a Russian bronze medalist.
Simone Biles of the United States performed in the balance instrument in the women's artistic gymnastics overall evaluation final at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth and fifth American woman to receive the overall evaluation award in a row, and was named the best of his generation and perhaps the best of all time.
When the final total was published, she burst into tears and her long journey to reach this moment ended.
This success has brought the sport to the same level as athletes like Michael Phelps, who can be seen once in every generation, bringing it to new levels:
Biles spent his last three years as one of the most successful in this sport with 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold, and a stunning mix of ambition and tenderness that allowed 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton to call herself the "best gymnast I have ever seen".
A final test awaited him in Brazil, which was between him and the burden of high expectations rather than between Biles and the rest of the field.
It would be a disappointment to return to the family home in Spring, Texas, with less than a handful of gold medals.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Aly Raisman of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after receiving the gold and silver medals in the overall assessment of artistic gymnastics women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, respectively, Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first on Tuesday, when retired national team coordinator Martha Karoliy served as an exclamation mark at her farewell party.
Although Biles insists that he never looks forward in this long run towards the top, this is not exactly true.
The part of the ground exercise routine, which includes the iconic revolving pass, is made with Latin music that will fit perfectly into the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, who was adopted by her grandparents when she was a young child, was discovered by Boorman's mother on a trip to a gym where she was coached by Aimee Boorman.
He hasn’t lost any of the overall ratings since the summer of 2013; this is a winning series that Biles has to keep going as long as he wants.
Mustafina took the lead in two rotations, but it was temporary.
The balance instrument and ground exercises where Biles took the world championship had not yet been performed.
He took the lead with 15,433 points on the balance instrument and crowned it with 15,933 points on the ground exercise.
Raisman hugged her gently for courtesy as she waited for the final score, and while Biles’s vision of once writing a scribbling notebook came true, tears appeared around the glowing red, white and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was like a rematch from four years ago, when he shared the fourth place but then lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans called "grandmother", took the lead.
He sent a kiss to the crowd after the place exercise, which he overcame with a sometimes dubious return.
For 19-year-old Biles, it can be said that his very shared tweet earlier this week has now taken on a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims shot in serial killer while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot while they were talking and listening to music in the car, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, were shot in a car parked on a garage road on June 12.
According to the report, the gunman was standing on the passenger side of the car when he fired eight shots with a pistol and walked away with another vehicle.
Police say the three murders didn't appear to be a robbery because the attacker didn't take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900.
A spokesperson for Phoenix police, Deputy Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to investigate whether the attack was linked to the previous four attacks.
In a four-month period, a total of seven people were killed and two injured in nine attacks, mainly in Spanish-speaking neighborhoods.
Earlier this month, Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO, “This happened in the residential area in front of a house.”
The suspect is thought to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in a late 1990s model, a black BMW in a late 1990s model, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers refused to explain the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were related to the same killer and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was hospitalized for his injuries and later died.
Liner (31) and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
One witness told police that it was not unusual for these people to be sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting that targeted an empty truck half an hour before the three murders.
The researchers found shell casings, extracted a bullet from a seat, and detected particles of bullet in the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old microcephaly patient: 'It's getting better'
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, his toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, Edmund has a microcephaly disorder, a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When I first came home, my first thought was I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't ask for that.
That’s not true, of course you want it.”
He and his wife, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never get to know them or even survive them.
Some doctors have gone so far as to offer him to be admitted to a nursing home.
"My first reaction was to say that I don't think people are doing it anymore," Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund couldn’t sit or crawl upright until he was three years old and still can’t speak.
But he is slowly reaching some turning points.
He can walk and ride a bicycle with help.
She also enjoys playing and singing with her two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund invented to say, "Please sing for me."
Picciuto told CBS News, "We're teaching him sign language."
But this is not sign language as we know it, it says that Edmund made up his own signs.
Microcephaly may occur due to a number of different conditions; a genetic condition such as Edmund may exist and may be caused by infections caused by viruses such as measles and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and the course of the disease can vary greatly.
It’s too early to say how the lives of people with Zika infection will be affected.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of uncertainty about his future.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
And he still doesn't know it.
In fact, I haven't asked a question about the course of the disease for a long time, as I didn't really expect anyone to tell me.
However, Picciuto is in a position to offer hopeful advice to mothers of babies with congenital apologies due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods in Louisiana, Mississippi, trigger rescue teams
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected by Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported flooding in numerous rivers northeast of Louisiana and south of Mississippi, posing a widespread flood risk after heavy rainfall.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and support for affected neighborhoods is on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor's Office for Domestic Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests were made for high-water vehicles, boats and trenches.
Steele stated that tons of trenches were requested only for Tangipahoa Neighborhood.
There will be a flood alert in most of southern Louisiana by Saturday.
Weather services said in a statement that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rainfall could fall on the area.
In southern Alabama, there was a flood watch on Saturday as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
Both are expected to reach record levels during the weekday at the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs in Louisiana.
The forecaster Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding in the Ascension Quarter posed a threat, as the flow of filled rivers to Lake Maurepas would be slow.
The Tickfaw River, located just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, has already reached the highest level measured at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescue teams continue to rescue people from floods in the Amite and Wilkinson accidents in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said the water from the Beaver Creek, normally 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
He stated that another stepdaughter living nearby had warned him.
“We woke up and the water was still coming,” Hansford said.
It was close to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level he had seen in the river in 48 years of his life.
Hansford said he and his family were disabled and that he was the only person who could swim.
Hansford said he rescued all three of his emergency workers with a large, military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they took refuge on Friday.
Krautmann said the floods were "rapidly spreading" as the heavy rains continued, and authorities were considering an eviction order.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground has been saturated at a high level since Wednesday.
The authorities said the streets under heavy rains and flooding have created a need to rescue the residents of Tangipahoa Neighborhood and take school holidays in five school districts.
CBS affiliate WWL reported that a female city councilman in Tangipahoa said 200 houses were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but these are now under flooding.
Neighborhood chief Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by rising waters.
Bunkers have been opened for people evacuated from the town of Amite and the city of Hammond.
“As soon as the waters begin to retreat, they will be allowed to return home,” he said.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa Neighbourhood, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to rising waters, and trenches were offered for picking up by residents trying to keep the water away from their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we experienced was in March," said city administrator Lacy Landrum.
Looks like it's going to be a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison Crash Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said the rain on the Gulf Coast continued steadily.
Several homes were reported to have flooded on Tuesday, but so far there have been no reports of flooding in that direction for Friday.
Keith Townson, the director of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water where I’ve never seen water before,” Townson said, adding, “and it’s still raining.”
Six-year-old Mahaj Brown survived Philadelphia attack with bullet holes in his body
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting this week in the city.
For CBS Philadelphia, Mahaj Brown was identified by his grandparents.
Brown's grandmother and grandfather said he had multiple gunshot wounds in his body, including the groin area, legs, arms and abdomen, but was conscious when he was brought to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station: "She suffered too much, her tiny body was pierced with bullets."
I can't believe it.
The boy was listed among those who maintained his child’s critical condition in the hospital and went through some surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was going to start first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two men, 29, one 32, were shot.
CBS Philadelphia said one of the 29-year-old men was in critical condition, while the other two victims were stable.
The station reported that the child was found shot in the front seat of a car with one of the 29-year-old men in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating if one of the injured was the attacker.
Detectives say more than one gunman may have fired at each other at CBS Philadelphia.
The crime scene was full of shell casings in the form of assault weapons belonging to different assault weapons.
Looks like it's definitely been a long fight.
There were hives on both sides of the street and sidewalk.
This indicates that more than one gunman has been found, and both are active,” Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Multiple homes and vehicles in the area were also damaged.
No arrests were made and police were reportedly investigating security cameras.
A 6-year-old girl was shot in the arm by an accident while playing outside her home in West Oak neighborhood on Tuesday.
He's in recovery, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I named the Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team this year, and there are more than one reason for that.
First of all, I have participated in all Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant before.
Second: This team has three gymnasts who inspire many girls of different ethnicities: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team, brought together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team is finally showing a similar look to America.
It also strengthens the presence of black and Latino women at the top levels of this sport.
Over the past four years, the first female gymnast has always been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1st and 2nd.
It's powerful.
In the recent Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America supported him.
Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who now have three World Championships, will be able to witness the extraordinary performances of unexpected but skillful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the women's overall rating.
And his teammate Aly Raisman won the silver medal.
We’re seeing the best times of this sport, but that’s not the case with gymnastics courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to be part of the Olympic teams.
The reason they're the "Last Five" is because there will only be four gymnasts on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and that's the last year Marta Karoliyi will be coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is a fairly costly sport, and gymnasts work primarily in private gymnastics clubs, supported by parent-paying education, travel, jersey, competition, hotel fees (for trainers, gymnasts and families) and many more.
Most of these gym clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support these businesses.
These clubs are the only place where gymnasts can get training, and they require a costly and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Haney have been training these athletes since they started gymnastics.
We don’t offer communities more affordable and accessible gymnastics training for the countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, based in Harlem, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 young people in the city (primarily black and Hispanic) and coached both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (where I grew up) to offer quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this wonderful Olympic sport.
Gymnastics improves the strength, flexibility, and coordination of the body, and provides the characteristics of mentally hard work, discipline, and determination.
This combination offers long-term benefits in terms of health, success at school and at work.
This team will be the inspiration that will guide thousands of young girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sports activities is very important, especially for girls.
We're going through really exciting times.
Thank you to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for bringing the gold medal as an Olympic team, demonstrating clearly "The Power of Girls" and motivating many young girls with different backgrounds to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After Jeremy Hunt’s proposal was rejected, assistant doctors decided to continue strikes.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after an agreement was reached on the improved contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who took part in the vote voted against it.
In July, Mr Hunt announced plans for the NHS to impose sanctions on the contract, stating that "no one owns it" and that further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first group of assistant doctors was moved to a new contract with changes in their work practices at night and on weekends to improve care outside normal hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, head of the BMA’s assistant doctors’ committee, said in a statement last night: “Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially because they think it will trigger the current labor crisis and not have an equal attitude towards all doctors.”
The first group of doctors is only eight weeks away from the new contract, and the time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute by talking were met with the government's reluctance to engage and, in some cases, deaf silence.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act immediately, lift the sanctions and listen to the concerns of the assistant doctors."
Assistant doctors have made it clear that if they do not do so, they are prepared to increase their slowdown.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, with nurses and consultants having to replace the doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after an agreement was reached with the British Medical Association officials on the improved contract.
The BMA wants improvements on weekend fees for 54,000 contract-related assistant doctors.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive officer of the NHS, urged assistant doctors not to carry out any strikes.
Mr Mortimer said: “The strike doesn’t solve anything, but it puts pressure on the team and services that are already busy, causing concern, discomfort and distress for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have continued our discussions with the Assistant Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other officials, we have approached positively their concerns about the Surveillance Task and Reporting.
Employers, important issues - such as distribution, education flexibility, additional education costs for those who take a break from their careers, mutual agreement on the curriculum, education-induced leave and gender pay gap in medicine - were concerned with maintaining positive communication in relation to employers, hoping to act in accordance with the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.
Medication that can eliminate the risk of heart attack at a cost of <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day
After authorities recommend giving it to more people for longer periods of time, thousands of heart attack patients will be able to benefit from the costly <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day drug.
Anti-coagulation ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurring crises for people with heart disease.
The drug was administered for 12 months following a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another stroke.
The NHS observer, NICE, recommended that it be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS observer, NICE, has suggested that it should be given to humans for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, around 140,000 people in the UK have a heart attack, and one-quarter of them have another crisis or stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is that fatty substances accumulate and form plaque in the walls of the arteries.
If your plaque breaks down, this can cause a blood clot and cause a heart attack, blocking the blood to the heart.
And if the clot is dislodged, a stroke occurs if it moves through the bloodstream, blocking the blood flow to the brain.
People who have had a crisis before are at higher risk of having another one.
Created by the UK firm AstraZeneca under the trade name Brilique, Ticagrelor reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of clots.
The NICE guideline draft, published today, recommends that individuals be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then administer 60 mg twice daily with aspirin for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Although there are effective secondary prevention treatments available, about a quarter of those who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke, and the consequences are often devastating.”
Fear of reoccurrence can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Evidence suggests that the use of ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurring heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With the provisional recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to have increased the treatment options available to thousands of people who are waiting to take advantage of it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor is limited for more than three years, including the risk of bleeding, the guideline does not recommend treatment after this period.
PC culture increases vote corruption in Muslim regions
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman has been dismissed after a government report last year.
As the devastating government report presented today shows, the culture of political correctness has led to widespread vote corruption in Muslim communities being ignored.
Former Cabinet Secretary Sir Eric Pickles has scolded the police, election observers and the city hall for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to "excessive sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former community secretary and today’s anti-corruption tsar said the level of intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so bad that police should be allowed to pull a strip outside voting booths to protect frightened voters.
He proposed that voters keep their identities with them to prove their identity when they vote.
In the present case, it is enough for the elector to tell the name and address of the electorate.
The report even recommends permanent ink on the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said that those on the call should be better protected.
He called for better access to the press on board papers and decisions of informal committees or working groups.
"This aims not only to protect against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was prepared by Downing Street following the Tower Hamlets vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after repeated corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "dishonestly abused" the religious feelings of the Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said that he was conducting his campaign on the basis that it was a religious duty for Muslim believers to vote for him.
Up to 300 games were suspected or the result of the use of fake identity, voting as if it were someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He warned of corruption, especially in voting by mail — where he allegedly pressured the older members of the Muslim community to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric has made some suggestions to regulate the voting system, including having people with IDs to prove who they are.
The report included the following statements: "Evidence has been obtained that some ethnic minority communities have been subjected to pressure on their valued individuals, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were concerns that state institutions were ignoring such behavior because of their "political correctness" based on ethnicity and extreme sensitivity to religion."
Ser Eric made 50 proposals to regulate the system, including preventing political activists from processing postal and voting paperwork for the purpose of "vote collection".
The report, examined by Theresa May, also calls for tightening registration controls to prevent the election register from being used for immigration and social assistance fraud.
Considering the option to require voters to show their identity before voting.
Permanent ink on the person’s fingers after voting to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of the person to determine the eligibility to vote.
Applying a three-year limit on requests for voting by automatic mail.
Prohibition of political campaign officials and activists from processing the ballots sent in the completed mail and the envelopes of the votes sent in the mail.
The police are authorized to strip around the voting booths.
Amendment of the law to facilitate the charge of intimidation under the People’s Representation Act of 1983.
Illegality of taking photos in voting booths.
In voting booths (except in Wales) only English is required.
Strengthening the staff’s training to enforce the rule that voters should enter the cabinet alone.
Ser Eric has relentlessly criticized the police, saying it's "interesting" that no charges have been filed in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral tribunal has ruled that there is no room for accusations of repeated corruption and illegal activities for Lutfur Rahman and his representative," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt – according to the nature of the criminal evidence.
He also criticized ineffective "holy marking controls" in the municipality's electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “Tower Hamlets’ court ruling last year was a warning alarm.
While our nation has the pride of forming the homeland of parliaments, the proliferation of these alarming and secret electoral corruptions and the rejection of them by some institutions can undermine this good reputation.
To be crazy for Kate's cyclist-like and other famous analogues of the Rio Olympic Players
This week, fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics went wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete isn’t the only one to draw attention for its resemblance to celebrities while fighting for the gold medal this summer, at least so does social media.
Therefore, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous figures we see on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who look like Hollywood celebrities beyond looking at them.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left) from the U.S. Men's Archery Team, compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate’s similarity on the bike track, many people online have shown that an archer can look just as much like Leonardo DiCaprio as his twin.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men’s Archery Team, shook Twitter after revealing photos showing his resemblance to the Star of the Moneyhunter movie.
And the archer, realizing this craziness on social media, admitted that he had been told that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
Brady told the Huffington Post: "I don't think there's a big resemblance except for hair and beard."
'He's a handsome man, so I think that's a compliment.'
One of the most popular comparisons of London 2012, there is another one that will undoubtedly be even more noticeable this year: the incredible resemblance of British long jumper Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina was said to be very similar to Cuban-American artist Gloria Estefan with her large and meaningful eyes.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been likened to Matthew Morrison, the star of Glee for years.
Change: This user states that Nathan’s Starter movie star is an ‘athletic version’
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have long been compared to each other due to the similarity of their lush eyebrows and lips.
The Russian team's silver medal swimmer has the same bronze skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while fans say Nathan Adrian of the U.S. Team resembles the athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.
Rough women: football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter's star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face shape and eyes
Not alone: a Twitter user was very pleased that other people noticed this similarity
A theory that remains in the air: This user thinks there may be a reason behind this pair’s similar appearance
A Twitter user said he was happy that “the rest of the internet thought Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter were like twins.”
In reality, the American football star and actress who plays for Dexter has similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's almost identical smile, with Gabby Douglas, another gold-medal gymnast, and Gabrielle Union, the star of Youth Fire.
CBC Olympic announcer apologises for commenting that Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-round freestyle at 4x200 m has enraged those who watched CBC's live Olympic broadcast on Wednesday.
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologise for commenting that one of its announcers, a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer, was “wiped out like a bad smell” and “died like a pig” in the race.
Speaker Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when the women began to express their ideas in the 4x200m free-floor final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC’s team to add ‘color’, was heard to say: ‘The 14-year-old little Chinese has screwed up, baby.’
He was so excited, he went away like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) finished the second leg of the flag race with 1:57.79 seconds behind Canadian Taylor Rack, allowing Canadians to close the gap with China.
Canadian audiences move quickly after being surprised by the tone and language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC announcer just say that the 14-year-old swimmer died like a pig?"
The idiot didn’t know he was still on the air.”
Chinese Ai Yanhan was described in the 4 x 200 m Free Flag Race as follows: ‘The 14-year-old little Chinese has screwed up, baby.’
Twitter quickly and harshly criticized Byron MacDonald, and many of them reported him.
Twitter users couldn’t stop hearing how insensitive Byron Macdonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all look like racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who ran CBC, apologized for MacDonald's comment, saying: "We apologize for the comment made to the broadcast on the swim race."
Those were really unfortunate words, and we are sorry that such an incident happened.”
CBC has had to apologise to people who tweeted at least 90 times in response to comment
Scott Russell was forced to apologise on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and pasted the apology to over 90 Twitter users who filed complaints about MacDonald’s comments.
The network quickly issued a statement apologizing.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements have been made and that they have been published.
Last night, in the broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers and our followers on social media.
We would like to clarify that Byron’s comments were not about the swimmer’s personality, but his performance.
However, these were rather inappropriate and unfortunately chosen words, and Byron was deeply saddened by what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald also apologized in the broadcast and attempted to defend his words, saying he did not want to commit a personal attack.
"I want to apologize for a comment I made last night after the women's flag race," he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I wasn't referring to the swimmer's personality, I was referring to his performance."
'Not to mention, I didn't mean to be disrespectful, and I'm so sorry.'
Primark customer threw up anger at woman who tried recklessly underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn’t know what to do when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark store floor to try her panties.
Worse, the woman looked at how it looked in her, took it out and put it back on the shelf.
He continued to look, and then tried four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The place where she tried panties before putting them back on the shelf was the Primark store in the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two children who was in the store at the time, said that after she tried her mysterious underwear, the mysterious woman "was dressed again and left the store without buying anything."
He said: “People couldn’t believe their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store and picked up a panties from the window, took off her pantyhose and pants and put them on.
'He didn't try to find a special place to do it, he was in the middle of it with all his disrespect.'
'Everyone was looking at him when he took off his panties, and it turned out he didn't like the panties because he put them back on the shelf.'
He tried three more laundry until he decided he didn’t like anything, and then he dressed again and left the store.
'He didn't seem to care who was watching him, and he didn't think about who would buy the panties he was trying on later.'
Ms. Davidson, who lives in the town of Kent (33), said: “It’s disgusting to think someone would take home an unclean pants that someone else was wearing.”
This happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, “I think the staff found the clothes after she left and took them out of the sale, which is a good thing.”
“When I buy a new panties and go home, it would be really bad to think that someone else was wearing them and taking them off and coming to me without washing them.”
A Primark spokesperson said: “Primark is aware of what happened at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday (August 9th).
The relevant product is removed from the sale.
How to protect yourself against armed attacks with Krav Maga
The outside world is quite dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can help you stay safer.
We met with Rhon Mizrachi, the chief master of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to learn how to deal with armed robbers in close proximity.
Whether you're being approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how you can turn the situation against the robber.
Mizrachi says that when you are approached from behind, the first thing you need to do is turn your face and see the attacker and ‘empty the line of fire’.
Then you will hold the gun between your forearm and your shoulder and hit it in the face with your empty elbow.
Then when you kneel in his groin, the attacker’s pain will double, and at this stage you will turn the gun away and take it away from him, and the gun will be pointed at him, and you will hit him in the face with the gun’s barrel and the back up.
A similar technique is applied when the gunman approaches from the front; pulling your body out of the line of fire, you grasp the gun and turn it so that the attacker can’t shoot.
At the same time, you put your weight on the gun, punch the attacker through the chest area, turn the gun around, take it away from him, and push the gun back towards him.
Does that sound tricky?
Check out the video to see how Mizrachi did it.
But remember, if you’re not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid every robbery would be to give your money to the robber.
Traveler Ian Wright uses his tongue for his travel guide to the dirtiest places in Europe
The British traveller has undergone a serious test of his immune system and gnawing reflex by licking some of Europe’s most filthy and disgusting places.
Host and travel writer, Ian Wright of Suffolk (51) drove his tongue to a Euro banknote, a Piccadily Circus railroad, a siphon button of a train toilet, and a pay phone in Russia to prove the strength of the immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what kind of work he was involved in.
But the experiment, which was to be turned into a film called The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength, yielded some surprising results.
While the idea of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, there are actually a lot more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his trip to Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the growth and health of stomach bacteria.
Fortunately, nothing she licks had any effect other than the bad taste she left in her mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things to test the endurance of his stomach.
This mission in a wide range from general railings at train stations to toilet flush buttons has definitely tested the immune system.
In the film, he said, “I haven’t been very attentive to my health since I was a kid, and I’ve put a lot of things in my mouth, from soil to worms and mud.”
During the film, he proved the reason for his fame.
All he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The reptile sample showed a luminometer count of over 4,000 units.
In comparison, in newly washed hands, this number should be below 60.
But it was a Russian public toilet where he refused to lick when the luminometer count went up above 4000 units when he was under 60 in newly washed hands.
Mr. Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio produced The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
He said in the movie, “It’s close to being one of the worst things I’ve ever smelled in a toilet.”
There's nothing worse than that!
I can't lick anything because it's disgusting.
The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength was developed in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria, as well as stomach bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juices and New Categories, said: “We really wanted to bring something new to consumers.
Something that is impressive to watch and also explains the benefits of probiotics.
We finally had a lot of crazy brainstorming where the idea of "let's call Ian" came up.
They claim that interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put the products in a much larger context — the good and bad bacteria around us on a daily basis, the importance of stomach health and its connection to the immune system.
The interest in stomach health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we would be able to provide consumers with more intriguing information about it.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me tell you, if Ian licked some of the things I wanted him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet in the movie, I would lose my respect for him.”
Naturally, some things were easy for Ian to lick, but some were quite difficult.
I’m glad we recorded some of these dirty licking acts.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents attributed lactic acid bacteria to stomach health, and 58 percent said they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least intermittently.
Madgan family destroys social housing in Saltash, Cornwall before evacuation
A rogue family left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 worth of damage in the social housing they were evacuated for fear of scaring their neighbors.
After several complaints about Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock, Saltash was expelled from the residence in Cornwall.
When they were forced out of the property, the housing association officials were surprised to see that the property was unrepairable.
There were big holes in the walls, floorboards were removed, rubbish was scattered on the floor, and graffiti was written on the walls.
The family has now been removed from the residence and is believed to have benefited from special accommodation options
Cornwall Housing housing manager Donna McEvoy said she was worried that the situation might not be salvageable.
He said: “It’s really a nightmare for the people here, and I think people shouldn’t have to live that way.
There's a lot to be reckoned with, because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and their names have a bad reputation.
The family had three sons who lived in the interim estate, and according to police, the family had adopted many intimidating behaviors, including fighting with baseball bats on the street, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking, and excessive shouting, argument, and blasphemy.
In June, antisocial behavior was decided for Skeldon (47), whose name was included in the lease agreement.
Old rubbish was found in many rooms of the house that were thought to be destroyed
The floorboards of a drug-sold property in the past have been dismantled.
Neighbors said they saw fights on the street and police were frequently called.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted him and his wife this week after giving them extended 11 weeks to relocate voluntarily.
The evacuation process was greeted with joy by relaxed neighbors who said their lives had turned into nightmares.
One person said, ‘Nobody cares.’
We've been living with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen cops here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because it was so quiet; we’re not used to it!
They're finally gone, and now everything's gonna be great.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s neighbourhood sanctions officer, said the family was not cooperating with the local administration.
The family had been living in this house for 20 years, and the property was often called to the police.
On the side of the social housing, covered with plants, trash and old toys were thrown.
He added: “It’s really embarrassing that the lender doesn’t take any responsibility for the evacuation of himself and his family; the evacuation has always been Cornwall Housing’s last option.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and the actions were so frightening that neighbors were not supposed to give a witness.
I highly appreciate the efforts of my team, Devon and the Cornwall Police Force, and the community members who bravely stand out to inform us.
I hope that this development will provide some relief to the neighbors and be understood as a message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr Fitzpatrick said they had three sons who lived on the property at different times, but they were in their 20s.
A dirty bed left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after evacuation
Residential workers will have to clean up piles of garbage surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of marijuana, weighings, personal items and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to Class B drug possession with intent to sell.
He claimed he would use the money to buy a tombstone for his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After becoming homeless, it turned out that Tanya and her husband were now staying in a private residence in Plymouth.
Most of the walls of the house had graffiti.
Police say they will work to evacuate tenants who violate rental rules.
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall Police Forces said the evacuation was also a warning for other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
He said: "This is a message for those who think they can do whatever they want without facing any accusations and that their behavior will be in vain."
The Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, which will continue to work with their partners to protect society, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behavior.
Tourists in Portugal are horrified when a low-flying military plane crosses the beach
Tourists sunbathing in Aveiro, Portugal experience the shock of their lives
The Portuguese Air Force flew the P-3C Orion at a very low level.
The Air Force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when tourists start to panic as they cross a low-flying jet-filled beach.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane approaching those sunbathing on the sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal, at almost the level of contact.
The holidaymakers stood up because they were clearly concerned about the noise caused by jet engines, unable to see what was coming towards them through the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro yesterday afternoon.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few vacationers who shared the video of the dramatic close-flight on social media, said: “Two times it really went down and it seemed like it was about to hit at some point.”
“I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was going to crash on me,” Nuno Arroja said.
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane that emerged from the darkness began to fly at extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify the fishing boats on the coast and had to go so low that it was the only way to control them.
He said the jet was flying lower than normal because of poor visibility due to the smoke from the nearby fire, but the air force insisted that nobody’s safety was compromised.
This summer, fires that were hard to extinguish severely destroyed certain parts of the Portuguese mainland, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said the pilot must fly low today due to conditions that make it difficult to see (intensive fog and smoke from fires that are hard to extinguish)
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify the fishing boats.
London girl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British female students who left London last year to join ISIS, has been reported dead in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family received information about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
According to ITV News on Thursday, he is believed to have died in a Russian airstrike in the region of Raqqa, where the group is strong in the country.
Sultana, 17, died while planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain, according to her family.
"We hope that this situation will highlight that going to war zones as a tombstone and testament to others is really risky and will discourage people from making this choice," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, two schoolgirls from Sultana and East London boarded a plane to Turkey, followed by a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family were told she was married to an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow in months.
Reid says he will not give up Garland as a Supreme Court nominee if Clinton is elected.
In the Senate, Democratic leader Harry Reid said he believes Democrats will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if Hillary Clinton is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland's approval process since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the new president will choose former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia's replacement.
In a video call Thursday, Reid said he believed that Clinton would choose Garland and that he had "reasonable reasons for that".
A spokesperson for Reid later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton and was speculating whether he would nominate Garland.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team didn't want to "broke the current situation" by making a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia.
Reid said Republicans who prevented Garland from being nominated were Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "protestants" and "rebels".
He said Trump was not fit for the task.
Treats says she's in favor of a nude calendar 'as well as for women'
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli for 2017.
But instead of celebrities and nudes, they are working to find the next generation top models for the 2017 NU Inspiration Fairies calendar.
Steve Shaw, president of Treats, said earlier this year that this magazine, which has a high nudity rate, was different from the old Playboys because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Obviously, he believes the calendar is the same.
Shaw said in a press release on the calendar, “We need to go back to the classic, obsolete nudity display so that women, like men, can easily look at these images of the female body as inspiration.”
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or participate in open conversations in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl target: who actually buys the record?
Middle-aged loners love vinyl.
Let us tell you that this statement is based on real data before you go to the comment section to make wonderful insults under our pseudonym Not.
According to YouGov, the return of plaques, which is a much talked about topic, is a result of middle-aged nostalgia, not the Y-generation, which seeks innovation created by a physical object.
Those who recently purchased vinyl albums are mostly between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the lowest probability.
This is not only due to the accumulation of enthusiasts; it is of emotional importance; older vinyl buyers often like to keep their emotions to themselves (56% and 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% and 66%).
Are YouGov’s findings correct?
If this blog were a TV-run news, the camera would watch it walking through a crowded street of Soho, in a modest gray suit, displaying many gestures before stopping, and then putting my hands together and opening up, saying something authoritative like: “Then let’s have a look.”
Well, let's take a look.
As Soho’s center slowly loses its magic and unusual air (the buildings that were once owned by independent sellers are now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases), there are still a few specialized record stores available.
I’d probably like him to stop at the camera for the next part; I’d stand near different men in some of these stores, trying to learn about their age and their emotional state through observation.
Stuart (55) from Glasgow, whom I follow as he goes from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, probably a woman in her 20s), spends an afternoon in London for a meeting and looks at the stores to fill a few hours of his free time.
I asked him if he was a collector.
He says, "I guess I am."
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plaques above the picture (the picture sent me by e-mail, I did not follow him home) adorn the walls of the living room.
The reason he collects so many albums and singles is partly because of his disposable income; he can now buy records he couldn’t afford when he first came out and buy back what he sold when he was young and broke.
“Most of the things I get are in the late '60s and early '70s, things that come out when I was 11 or 12; I’m too young to buy,” she says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverts who like to be alone, and he adds: “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink a lot of alcohol.
That's my bad habit.
Wez (25), who works at Sister Ray, also thinks that most of the customers he meets fit the YouGov profile.
But he also realized that there was a new wave of media-influenced exaggerated ads, and that people who heard that fashion was coming back needed to buy back the old records.
During my interviews, I realized that people would normally throw away their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who used to sell their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to get them back.”
This could explain the increase in people of a certain age revitalizing vinyl.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
It takes a few seconds to realize that in a store like Phonica, record stores offer a relaxing community of people of similar personalities.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may be overwhelmed by the digital world and want to take refuge in the stability of familiar record covers reminiscent of calm youth.
Wez says, “Sometimes it can be because of filling a void or seeing material things as a kind of comfort.”
Since I’m a collector myself, I have this, and I think most people have it too.
This is an easy way to fill your head.
A colleague who jumped out of a pile of records says, "We're like social workers."
A survey in April revealed that 50 percent of vinyl album buyers had not yet listened to the album.
The survey also found that 41% had a pickup that they never used, and 7% bought vinyl even though they didn’t have a record player.
At this stage of the story, I would probably have an extremely anxious look when examining a series of bossa nova compositions.
The "reward" aspect of this return is also an element that was noticed by Jonny (42), who worked in Sounds of Universe (data count: three middle-aged men).
“Someone recently came to me and said, ‘I don’t play any records, but I want to buy a Radiohead record to put on our shelf.’”
While this does not represent a large percentage, it certainly reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't play records."
These are not the elderly, but the young, who are in their late teens, who are just starting out.
Now when I get to Fopp, which has reserved almost an entire floor for vinyl, I see that the mass is quite variable.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, young boys and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is less serene than the above-mentioned stores (the last piece of Wild Beast) and sex-related pop is spreading from the speakers instead of calming jazz, it’s good to see the diversity among customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it’s hard to analyze the psychological trauma that bothers them by standing next to someone for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) has been strolling around Fopp for a few minutes and browsing through the discounted records.
Instead of spending, he just went out to look at the windows.
He says he doesn't have the option to collect records because he doesn't earn much.
It's expensive.
It’s easier to listen to music from the computer or in some other way, but the beauty of vinyl...it goes away sighing like a lovable person.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really nothing like it.
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
While pretending to be examining jeans, I observe a group of teenage girls gathered around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter had an argument about buying a Crosley recorder.
On the left is a staircase filled with the records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac; a must-have record for an average collection; a mix of modern and classic.
No one is looking; maybe it’s just for decoration purposes, some of them too high to be touched.
It's an "artistic vinyl."
But the curiosity about these items could mean that the industry will make more money and send fewer customers deeper into Soho; there’s not much to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a demographic group with more money and time than most spends more money on more luxurious items like vinyl.
But my findings show that YouGov’s results are at least correct in Soho record shops; they don’t take into account female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts who are numerous, in reality, in record stores or online forums.
These people are probably working pretty hard at school or in the office.
They certainly don’t spend Thursday evenings wandering around the record shops on Berwick Street, examining the records and escaping the gaze of a 30-year-old fake television presenter staring over the shoulders of middle-aged men who don’t know anything.
Greenland shark, the longest living vertebrate animal in the world - video
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy among vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, said the record was a five-metre-long female, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old.
French court rejects proposal to demolish stores in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of malls and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, Calais officials argued that the government should demolish a total of 72 dermal shops where people in the camp sell many products, cut hair, or sell basic meals for 50 cents (40p) of tea or a few euros.
The Calais Governorate argued that these places should be demolished as they create a tax-free parallel economy and pose risks to fire and hygiene.
The charitable groups explained to the court that stores and restaurants are vital, and that the free food offered by government-sponsored organizations and other groups is not enough for the growing population in the camp.
They argued that thrift stores and restaurants often provided shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille said there was no legal basis for the deportation of the 72 shops, but Calais Governor's concerns were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants play a much greater role than simply feeding people who live in “highly dangerous” conditions.
These areas provide comfortable meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places in danger of collapse, the non-profit Jungle Children’s Book Cafe offers 200 meals a day, teaches English and French, and provides advice to hundreds of underage refugees in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed petitions to protect this cafe for children.
A letter to the Guardian said the closure would be “a disaster for these children, some of whom are just eight years old.”
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population in the Jungle camp had grown to over 9,000 (the highest number to date) after the number of arrivals increased during the summer period.
After the gold in the Fiji master class, Britain won the silver medal in the Rugby Seven Championships.
Great Britain's impressive progress in the Rugby 7th Championship ended after a 43–7 defeat at Rio Deodoro Stadium in the final with Fiji on Thursday.
Fiji gave a master class in gripping, pass, side step, support, running lines and muscle strength to receive the gold medal, the first Olympic medal of all colors.
After the defeat, Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a consolation prize, and can now be proud of their efforts in the Olympic 7th opening tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, the South African Team may have found them in the final after they beat 7-5 in the semi-finals.
But still, a Fiji so fit could beat a team of 15.
Although not very credible, perhaps Great Britain will find solace in thinking that at least one Brit will wear the gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, an Englishman from Wimbledon.
This was a very difficult journey for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Seven Championship.
This time, they only lost one.
Although this loss is painful, the progress made is truly astonishing.
Fiji had a fascinating start, the players bounced past Great Britain's attempts to get the ball.
It was like running through a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and the World Series champions took a 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisao took action from the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another number in the right wing.
The match was 12-0 and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great intervention prevented mountain-like Leone Nakarawa from throwing the third, but it was only to delay Fiji's number.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner, and Great Britain fell back 17-0.
With only a minute left before the end of the first half, Nakarawa came back from the top and scored another point.
Vatemo Ravouvouvou then flew to the line for the number, passing through some tough British interventions.
Between this number and the circuit, the score reached 29-0.
When Fiji was a team set up to play in the 7th championship, it was as if Great Britain was still trying to learn the basics.
That's pretty much the case.
Great Britain made major changes during the period and closed the Fiji dam for four minutes, which was a good development for the first half, until Joshua Tuisova came on stage with the perfect Fiji play.
Dan Norton made an attempt for Great Britain and even though he tried to score from the left corner to score 36-7, the game fans were in the hands of the South Sea Islanders who sang, waved and danced.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji’s cheerful approach from beginning to end.
Maa Viliame also adored the latest additions to the Fiji game, which did not need to be decorated in the last minute.
When the whistle sounded, the Fijians began to celebrate, and Great Britain, devastated, made its way to the locker room.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20–5 in the semi-finals, while Great Britain faced South Africa in a difficult semi-final match; Britain advanced by a single point.
Kyle Brown led the South African team in the first half, but Dan Norton took the lead in the second half with dizzying foot movements.
In the top 15 of England, Anthony's brother Marcus Watson's wonderful intervention guaranteed victory and silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by their coach’s fight against cancer, raced to victory on the paddle
There will be no more emotional gold medals in these games, and that means a lot.
After 220 agonizing breaths from the first move to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they won the gold at Estacio da Lagoa could make a lot more sense.
Although there were two people pulling the paddles, there were three voices on the boat; the voice of their coach, Robin Williams, was echoing as they advanced to the second Olympic gold medal in a row, as the women were the first women in the double race to reach that level in England this year.
Their dominance was quite clear; it was the 39th race of their unprecedented, invincible series.
Although we see two great athletes floating on the surface in the swan elegance, this image does not exactly reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every paddle gold medal, there is a battalion of willing hands that provide incremental gains that make this difference, and no hand was as effective as their coach who didn’t know if he would live long enough to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
Like he said, they touched it and left.
I got the kind of bladder cancer that can be operated on, and they did it.
If they don't, they go everywhere.
That would be pretty bad.
It changes your view of life a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
He was very lucky to be able to start treatment outside of the season at the beginning of 2014, it is not known if it will be a correct statement in such cases, but in this way he will be able to minimize distraction.
I had to get paid, so I had to recover quickly.
That was an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital, and although they told me that I had to take a few steps, I was walking about 6, 9, 15 metres in the garden.
That's how it started.
Shovelling is a journey on its own, but it makes it a little bigger.
After the victory, Williams had a tense morning, whose minds spoke a little more than usual to overcome their own concerns.
Stanning, who is a captain of the Royal Artillery Corps and has been to Afghanistan before, said: “I was emotionally devastated this week, which may be a little extreme, but it really means a lot.
This once again highlights what this means to me and how hard Helen, me, and Robin are working.
I had a wonderful three years with Helen and Robin.
“Without Robin, we wouldn’t be here, so I’d like to thank him for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t find a better person or a better coach to work with.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
The two have achieved a difficult rhythm beyond the reach of their opponents.
Even in the last 500 metres that New Zealand and Danish teams have come to a standstill, Stanning and Glover’s power has not yet been exhausted.
We got caught up in that moment.
Helen called out, "Watch the process, watch the process."
It's really important not to get caught.
We had a good start, and we weren't trying to do anything incredible.
We didn’t expect the fireworks to explode today, we just wanted to win the race that we went out rowing well, which we did.
The two will take a year off before deciding what to do in the future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, the wedding of him and television adventurer Steve Backshall.
For now, he just wants to enjoy this moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would put a lot of pressure.
It took me six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion in London.
This was very new and I was very stressed.
Here, it took about four minutes.
That’s a much better feeling.”

Bulgaria announces inflation rates for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in June.
This is the highest value seen in years (since June 2012), but the first value seen above zero since October after a positive 0.2% value last year.
The average annual inflation measured by CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 – July 2016) was -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 – July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, meaning monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate difference (July 2016 to December 2015 comparison) was -0.2%, and the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, price increases were observed in the following consumer product groups: food and soft drinks (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices in clothing and shoes (2.2 percent), furniture, home equipment and routine care (0.5%) and health (0.1 percent) fell.
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; prices in communications and training groups remained at the same level.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says it was inspired by anime for this filter, but some observers say it’s racially insensitive.
With the lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality every day, allowing them to play with their identities at an absurd level.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
Lenses are reckless, feature-changing tools that make up over 30 million enhanced selfies every day.
The wrong steps are quickly dig deep into the public’s memory.
Snapchat lenses have faced accusations in the past that the app supports black classification or offers whitened skin tones as a beauty ideal.
Therefore, due to the lens they offer this week, which makes users squeezed eyes, broken teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics have criticized the company for its "Asian mask" that caricatures Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring disputes were a sign of a larger problem with the company’s diversity.
The news and outrage spread through The Verge and Motherboard’s news on Wednesday, and the day after, Snapchat announced it had removed the feature.
The company said in a statement: The lens was prepared not for the Asians to be caricatured, but for the anime characters.
But for observers who have experienced racism, this lens reminds them of painful stereotypes.
Other people generally rejected the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student of Korean descent, who shared a tweet about the photos, said in an email that the lens was "slightly painful and uncomfortable in the slightest expression."
“It’s hard to argue when it comes to comparing the effects of bad Asian cartoons and filters side by side.
This shows that the filter is not only an Asian mask, but also a humiliating Asian mask.
Snapchat is not the only company that transcends cultural trigger mechanisms.
American culture seems to be in endless conflict over diversity and inclusion in many areas, from the meeting rooms of institutions to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And the broad younger audience that Snapchat is addressing, which is more racial diversity than its counterparts, could also be interpreted as having a higher expectation of sensitivity.
In an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat’s lenses created a humiliating image for a user, “it’s much harder for such moves not to be noticed as before.”
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and called everyone in the same direction.
In an article for Medium and a phone interview, he said he believed race-related conflicts reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment apps.
Ms. Zhu ended her article with a tag, criticizing the company’s leader team of mostly white men: <0x23>SnapchatiSilin.
Ms. Zhu, an American of Chinese origin, said: “Either the different races are not diverse enough among their staff, they can make such decisions, or even if there are people of different races working there, they don’t feel safe or comfortable enough to talk.”
Other observers share his views on the complaint, which Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not share figures about the diversity among its staff, highlighting the specific company status.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to share its staff’s racial origins, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently incorporated a recruiter to internally increase its focus and inclusion efforts on underrepresented populations.
Zhu added: “I wonder if she needs more users like us who can tell her that this is not true.”
Congressional Panel Says Military Authorities Broke ISIS Intelligence
In a report published Thursday, a congressional panel reported that the United States Central Command officials had distorted intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than on the ground.
The Palace's Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Defense Subcommittee's Interim Report, a working arm formed by Republican board chairmen, found "a widespread dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts whose superiors said U.S. forces had altered the assessments of the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Fla. that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
A report on the report said: “The intelligence results approved by senior Centcom leaders typically paint a more positive picture of the U.S. anti-terror work than the facts on the ground, and consistently deliver far more positive results than the analysis of other members of the intelligence community.”
Ken Calvert, a California Republican, said: “What happened at Centcom is unacceptable; our combat troops are suffering while poor analysis is being presented to senior decision-makers.”
The leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also details the persistent problems in 2014 and 2015, which are included in the Central Command’s description and analysis of America’s efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered the changes, analysts are under pressure from Centcom leaders to offer a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack on Mosul could take place as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
In a statement, Kansas Republican Representative Mike Pompeo said, "After months of research, this issue has been made quite clear."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence leaders of the United States Central Command manipulated the commander’s intelligence results to make the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq trivial.
The Republicans formed a study arm after they learned that analysts expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State was being manipulated.
As the investigations continue, the report, published on Thursday, will follow much more comprehensive findings.
There is also another Centcom intelligence investigation being conducted by the Department of Defense’s general inspector.
Democrat members of the Palace Intelligence Committee also published their findings on Thursday, agreeing with some of the conclusions reached by the Republican workforce.
Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's Democratic chairman, said in a statement: "From 2014 to 2015, Centcom has created an extremely narrow-minded process of intelligence assessments about the Daesh and Iraqi Security Forces."
This process, according to Mr Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence results", led to demoralization among analysts and "not enough room for opposing views."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had not reached a conclusion that the White House had put pressure on Centcom analysts to fabricate "predetermined or political narratives."
The preliminary results of the congressional review were announced Tuesday by the Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported that a Pentagon inspector general review was available after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, as a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the congressional report during the investigation of the general inspector.
However, he said, “in some cases, experts may disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense support a healthy dialogue on these important national security issues.”
The research will echo beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria continues (a argument put forward by more and more Defense officials every day).
But last year’s accusations raised the question of how much President Obama could rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of the reflection of Islamic State intelligence began when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article stating that the administration of President George W. Bush advocated the holding of a small force in Iraq despite the objections of many analysts and did not consider the post-occupation of 2003 adequately, and has been debated for more than a decade.
Mr. Hooker also played an important role in the uprising against Islamic State intelligence.
Authorities said Mr. Hooker's team had come to the conclusion that despite public statements in the opposite direction last year that airstrikes against Islamic State-held refineries had not significantly affected the terrorist group's financial resources as they built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
However, as The Times pointed out in September, this finding did not go beyond the Central Command.
Centcom's then-commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year for his statement in the Senate, which was seen by many legislators as an extremely positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
U.S. Women's Lawn Hockey Team Preparing to Meet Britain Wins 4th in a row
Katie Bam scored her first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team in a 3–0 defeat by the Americans on Thursday, the day after she scored three goals in a 6–1 win against Japan.
Although five goals in two matches seemed to require a memorable skill, Bam (27) said he was not sure if he had done the same before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not one of those people who keeps records.
What he knows is that the Americans are 4-0 ahead of the Olympic tournament and share the first place in the group with Britain, who went on to lose after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face off on Saturday for the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals, and the match will determine who will finish first and who will finish second.
The team finishing first in group matches will not face the strong Dutch team, which is another group leader, for a little longer when the quarter-finals begin.
However, after Saturday's match, the Americans made surprising progress here after the London Olympics, where they came last out of the 12 teams.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.; he was 3 years old when he first took his hockey stick (his twin sisters were interested in this sport at Drexel) and at 16 he joined the national team, becoming the youngest player in the team.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he could not get into the final squad.
Then came 2012, when most things didn’t go well for him and his teammates.
The following year, a British coach, Craig Parnham, was commissioned and things began to change.
“It’s a cultural change, a mental change, a physical change,” Bam says.
We don't work like we did in London.
We've gone through a complete transformation.
On Thursday night, Bam received the first number of the first half with a close reverse kick.
India had not yet won the tournament, but the team was surprisingly resilient, keeping the score 1-0 until the third quarter in which Bam took part.
He made a long run with the ball to the left of the field and then curled up in the middle, throwing the ball into the goal and pushing the Americans 2-0 forward.
Melissa Gonzales scored her last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first match in which United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs did not score a goal in the tournament, allowing one goal in the first three victories.
He's lucky.
So does Bam.
“We’re in a good place right now,” Parnham said, but how good this place is depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
Trampoline Calm in the Midst of Olympic Ambition
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics are still going on.
Events in Rio de Janeiro represent an ambitious competition and work, and it’s as if it’s never over or can’t be avoided.
The Olympic torch itself is like a flaming baton, transmitted from swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can’t watch TV, read newspapers, or listen to what your neighbor says in a cafe without hearing anything about the rivalry between Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And there's Logan Dooley.
The first time Mr. Dooley has participated in the Olympics, sponsorships and TV commercials advising you to feel good, such as a swimmer, gymnast, or fencing, a dungeoned heartbeat ball may be one of the names shown during prime time hours.
However, Mr. Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California competes for the gold medal in the Olympics trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event on an equal level.
Far from the center, there are sports that are not universally recognized, partly in the shade: air rifle shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
The frog will always be with us, wishing it to be for a long time.
But personally, I would like to draw your attention to the hidden magic of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been known as an Olympic event since its introduction at the Sydney Games in 2000, very few people I have asked in the past 16 years have realized it is an Olympic sport.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it never won a medal on its trampoline, and had no competitors to climb to the finals until 2012.
For men, the Chinese and the Russians tended to share the prizes, and for women, the Chinese and the Canadians.
China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie MacLennan will try to protect the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, the trampoline is an almost oppressive activity, partly because it is thought to be worthy of the clown school instead of the Olympics in unconscious ears.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested in the subject.
It has a funny potential (such as the cartoon-like tremor created by the never-ending leap), but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving, two sports it basically combines.
The word “trambolin” comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means “tramplen”.
Champion candidates jump almost 30 feet above the air on a large trampoline and are asked to make a series of movements (torsion, pike, and salto) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty and “flight time”.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, including 16 women and 16 men, will compete in Rio.
The most common progress in the Olympics is directly forward.
Those who hope to receive a medal should go farther, faster and higher in their quest for gold, in some cases up to the end point, and in some cases backwards, upwards and downwards.
They’re not just chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but there’s also another tough line on television broadcasting; the world or Olympic record.
This determined effort, at noble, envied, and even extreme levels, is enough to drown even a spectator in tears.
But that’s just one of the features I find a bit exhausting when watching the Games.
The trampoline allows you to take a break from all of this.
The trampoline moves upwards.
Their goal is not to move forward.
He jumps up, looks weightless like an astronaut, goes up, goes down, and goes up again effortlessly.
Of course, there is no competition or difficulty, but a feverish work to achieve the result during the routine, there is no remote loss, only an elegant suspension of time and gravity, like a dream.
The calmer an Olympic race can be, the calmer it is.
Women's rankings, followed by finals, will be held on Friday afternoon at 13:00 Eastern time; men will again on Saturday at 13:00.
NBC will broadcast the finals every two days as a block in the afternoon from 14:00.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in the general upheaval.
And if consciousness is going to increase by offering male athletes just to eyebrow and objectify, as U.S. male gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal, we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for his new fans.
"A Generation of Protests" in Ethiopia, the long-time ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce resistance from the government.
Witnesses say a large number of protesters received deadly gunshots in a clash with police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
In the past decade, it has become one of Africa’s most stable nations and a solid ally for the West with its fast-growing economy.
However, anti-government protests in recent months have spread to more and more regions and shook the country.
Last week alone, thousands of people took to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed numerous unarmed demonstrators.
Protest footage, thought to be late last year or early this year, shows security officials whipping young people who were forced to stand up against a wall.
The highest-ranking United Nations human rights official is now asking for a thorough investigation.
Rashid Abdi, project director for the Somali Peninsula of the International Crisis Group, a research group, said: “It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to move forward.”
Ethiopia is one of Africa's most populous nations after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, particularly in Somalia, and there are very few countries in Africa that have received this much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy is growing in an impressive way.
Its infrastructure has been effectively improved; even a new suburban train is available in the capital Addis Abeba.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was not the best example of democracy (human rights groups consistently refer to the government’s repressive attitude), domestic opposition was limited, and opposition was effectively silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or exiled to the farthest corners of the desert.
But this may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from central Ethiopia, said: “If you strangle people and give them no choice but to protest, these events will happen.”
Youth is protesting.
A generation of protests.
There are many complaints, from land use to pressure from the ruling coalition on power.
After last year's highly criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies have taken the last seat filled by the opposition and are now in control of 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea, the sharp and controversial line that led to the war that killed hundreds of people in June, are also on the rise.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have disappeared in recent years, will reappear by taking advantage of this turbulence.
There are several factors that explain why painful emotions that have been boiling under the surface for years are now exploding.
The first one looks innocent: smartphones.
As cheap smartphones became more common and internet service became available, only a few years ago a large number of Ethiopians began to communicate using social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does in times of protest, most people were able to communicate via internet proxy servers that hide their location.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered in this way for the protests.
Secondly, solidarity between the two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia, the Oromo and the Amharas, also increased.
Oromo and Amharas are not normally allies.
For a very long time, the Amharas of the predominantly Christian mountainous regions of Ethiopia had advanced in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom were Muslims and lived in plain lands.
But that's changing, too.
Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader, said: “We are moving forward to gather under an umbrella and cooperate.”
The largest protests were in Amhara and Oromo.
Most Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia has been unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and is dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader Mr. Meles served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died in 2012 from an undisclosed illness.
He was thought to be a tactical genius who saw what not everyone could see.
Analysts say he is particularly proficient in detecting the first signs of unrest and calming and neutralizing competitors.
Conflict analyst Mr. Abdi said, "The current regime does not have this basic knowledge."
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been elected in relative uncertainty to replace Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say he has not earned the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigrayans.
As a result, more blood was shed with more fear.
Ethiopia's recent experience of this kind of confusion was in 2005, when thousands of people protested after the government's thefts by analysts after a sloppy election.
In the measures that followed, many protesters were killed, albeit less than last month, and this period of turmoil passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train, and notable progress in tackling poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped growing hatred against the Ethiopian government.
And it's becoming dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a town of Amhara, attacked businesses owned by Tigrayans, and Tigrayan hatred is also on the rise on social media.
Analysts say the protests have left the United States and other Western allies in a strange situation.
The U.S. government was using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, but it was recently said to be closed.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want this ally in a already fragile region to be torn apart.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, and added, "is like walking on a very thin rope."
Donald Trump Reveals Obama's Claim to Establish Daesh as "Criticism"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump repeatedly insisted on several occasions last week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not serious when he claimed to be the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This announcement raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate openly with the American people.
It also put him in a strange position in the process of trying to explain that this is not what he was implying to his deputies, who did everything in their power to defend him in the process of creating this turmoil.
Mr. Trump, after making this proposal at a rally on Wednesday night, further strengthened his thesis on Thursday, insisting in interviews that the president and Mrs. Clinton really implied that they had established ISIS.
But in a post on Twitter early Friday morning, Mr Trump said he was only making a cynical statement.
In a series of interviews, the post indicated that Mr. Trump had completely stepped back from the day before, when he said he was serious about this accusation.
When conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt reminded Mr. Obama that he wanted to destroy ISIS and tried to help Mr. Trump soften that comment, the Republican presidential nominee said he didn’t believe it.
After the fall of the polls, Mr. Trump was trying to change the focus of his campaign.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made controversial speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to go back to that.
He also tweeted that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes and find her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has used his sarcasm defense before.
Towards the end of July, after showing a view that suggested that the Russians hack into Ms. Clinton’s emails, he was met with great criticism, saying, “Of course I said that in a sarcastic way.”
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of political speech and step back where necessary.
Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who monitors the language used by both candidates, said: “It’s a pattern that allows it to “explain” in some way depending on the response, by testing how certain messages are reacting by those who support them.”
But at the same time, he deliberately makes these statements and knows that it is vague enough to be filtered from different lenses.
After the recent decline in polls, Mr. Trump has taken a much more aggressive stance for the general election, rather than softening the weather.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed that Mr. Trump is far behind Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia, and Colorado, and there is a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump often refrains from apologizing for the provocative things he says, he blames his critics for distorting his words or not understanding his humor.
But Mr. Trump’s jokes, which have been subjected to much more scrutiny in the last months of his presidential campaign, put his loyal supporters in a difficult position, no matter how provocative his comments might be, who have to publicly support him.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did his best to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday as one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent supporters.
When asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump’s thesis on the establishment of Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton’s Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, “I think he is making a legitimate, political criticism.”
From one point of view, ISIS before Obama was an unknown, small organization, the ones who found them cute were completely wrong, and that was because of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Most prominent Republicans are trying to argue that Ms. Clinton’s Obama administration, where she serves as foreign minister, has failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East, causing ISIS to grow.
Prior to Friday’s rallies in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to accuse the news media via Twitter of distorting every word and acting biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" TV experts who tried to unravel him, saying, "They can't do that!"
Some Democrats taunted Mr. Trump’s excuse, saying it was evidence that he was not eligible for the presidency.
Once upon a time there was a cafe that couldn’t cope with prices, it was back at Greenpoint with us.
Verb Cafe, an old-fashioned place in Williamsburg that only worked with cash, did not offer a Wi-Fi connection, but for 15 years it did offer great coffee.
Naturally, he couldn’t cope with the prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
In the summer of 2014, the store that replaced Verb sells Soap Cherie cupcake-shaped soaps.
Residents of the area complained that this was the last loss of the sanctified city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "New York is a change, I know that, but I still can't believe that the CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel is empty and Verb is a soap shop."
But New York is as much a city of reinventing as a city of change.
Last November, a renovated Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location, in the north.
The new Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi connectivity and accepts credit cards, but retains some former employees and similar simple weather.
The coffee is still good.
At the head of the New Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, the long-time employee of the old café, the owner and general manager of the new place.
He joined Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When a customer offered him funding for this new place, he said he would be thrilled to do so.
Mr. Rodriguez (36) left most things the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for bagels and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
Even the old Verb's lights were reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to offer some different experiences.
Added new materials.
Bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwiches are available on the menu, and ingredients such as capers and sautéed onions are also offered.
They have brown-rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers fresh fruit juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed that the former regulars were beginning to arrive decisively.
“A lot of our old customers couldn’t cope with the prices in Williamsburg either,” he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and frequented the Verb.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, he did not stop on this path.
Verb said he stopped drinking coffee for a while after it closed.
“I realized that what I liked was the coffee and culture in Verb,” he said.
He started drinking coffee again, but the other day he chose a dew mix, a new addition, instead of his usual iced coffee.
Another regular, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb on a regular basis since 2003.
He used to go there before work and always order the same thing.
“Every day, at seven and a half o’clock, I would go in without fail, and they would prepare my daily order of buttered bagels,” he said.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to make changes and added new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Mr. Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he makes some changes by adding bacon, eggs, and cheese to his daily bagel order.
Mr. Rodriguez said he was not offended by the soap shop that replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for the Verb using the cafe’s cold brewed coffee.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer."
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also adopted this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said that he would soon find a place to display the menu so that his new neighbors would also feel good about themselves.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee.
There's a possibility that the cafe will expand to the adjacent building.
For most customers, it’s enough to have a new Verb available where they can find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and he was very upset after the place was closed.
When the new place opened, Mr. Whitt said that being able to go in and get coffee made him feel at home.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The Depressive Food of Crisis Time in "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, immediately after his seat as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, a man who was fond of his throat, loved the fancy Fifth Avenue food, such as goose liver paste and Maryland turtle soup.
The menu of that day was much more modest: boiled eggs with tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, as dessert, dried plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelman said: “It was an act of solidarity with people who were in trouble about food.
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how they should eat.”
Couple living in Brooklyn Heights, food historian.
Mr. Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman, in her book "97 Orchard," was about eating the lives of slum dwellers in the Lower East Region.
Their new book, "A Square Meal," which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the story of American food during the Great Depression.
They also showed solidarity with food, meeting with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet in Flatiron region, which has existed since 1929, the year the crisis began.
Mrs. Ziegelman (54) ordered a sandwich with cream cheese and olives, while Mr. Coe (57) opted to place turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's order of rolls of meatballs suitable for the discussion of Crisis-era meals.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "The nuts were very popular."
He had peanut nuts, liver nuts, dry bean nuts.
They were made from something cheap that radiated the material with a material.
Imagine eating enough peanuts for dinner.
Mr. Coe, his face hurt.
He said, "He must have sat on a man's stomach like a bullet."
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, the tables in America were like a buffet.
Women cooked for men working on the farm, and freshly baked pies were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans were sending food to Europeans who died of starvation in World War I. "A Square Meal" explains the history of the ways in which the nation dealt with the sudden disappearance of being a center of abundance.
Mr. Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it, saying, “This was a time when food became a central, worrying issue for Americans.”
The new budget regime was equally alarming: mysterious foods such as nuts and stews became the main consumer product, "the stew was a great way to evaluate the remaining dishes," according to Ms. Ziegelman, so that the cooks could hide the bottom appetizing ingredients with a creamy sauce coating.
Fresh fruits were replaced by dried fruits, which were cheaper.
Over the years, meat, which has been at the heart of American cuisine, has become a luxury that has been distributed in a cost-effective way.
Interesting mixtures were tried for their calorie and nutritional value, and the feeling of satisfaction preceded the taste or general understanding of the kitchen.
While researching for her book, which included recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared the onion dish in a peanut butter-filled oven from that time.
Mr. Coe said, “This was not a popular contribution to the dinner table.”
Mrs. Ziegelman backed it up: "That was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing in common with onions in the oven.
In most home economy recipes, this was a prominent feature.
Between 1923 and 1943, home economics experts, including Louise Stanley, chief of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics, guided the country’s eating habits like never before.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be “saving” and promoted the struggle to turn slurry like carrot-cream spaghetti into tasty food.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historically tasty treats.
President Herbert Hoover's response to hungry citizens, such as the attitude of President Herbert Hoover to let me eat cake, is extremely appetizing.
On the one hand, he praised the simple Iowa farmer meals of his childhood, while on the other hand, he ate like a millionaire intellectual.
Mr. Coe said, “He liked to eat European cuisine flavors like salad dressing fish.”
He was eating his meals in a fully gold-plated dining room, wearing jackets suitable for dinner.
It was far from the truth.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example with his stomach.
As Mrs. Roosevelt hired a helper who did not care about taste, the book tells us, the White House began to offer not only the "most saddened dishes" ever made, but also the "most bleakly prepared dishes".
Once the country was back on its feet, most of the cooking methods during the crisis were left aside.
According to Ms. Ziegelman, the understanding of calories and nutrition and the way science is applied to cooking continues.
The couple stated that while writing the book, Ms. Ziegelman had learned a lot from her mother’s eating habits — for example, she could never throw away food.
Mr. Coe said, "The waste of food really scared him."
Mrs. Ziegelman spoke of her old memories: "It really made people sick."
There was a case of cream doughnuts.
After the plates were packed at Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe brought out a dessert they had prepared at home: the dried plum dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called whipped prunes," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that the most frequently cited number was to give these modest recipes a cool name.
There was no whipped cream; only prunes, some flour, sugar, water, and cinnamon.
Everyone hesitantly dipped his brown sticky slurry spoon.
Surprisingly, it wasn't too bad.
Mr. Coe took the second and third spoons.
Like someone who could save money, he said to his wife, "A little bit of chopped walnuts would be nice."
Gilead to Receive Legal Charges for Hepatitis C Patent Fighting with Merck
The U.S. District Judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to attorney fees for a hepatitis C patent case with drug manufacturer Merck <0x26> Co Inc.
After finding out that US judge Merck had committed a series of misconduct, including perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead was set free in June to pay $200 million in damages for the infringement of two Merck patents related to Sovaldi and Harvoni, Gilead's major-successful drugs.
At Thursday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead had the right to compensation for the fees incurred during the defense.
Merck is trying to keep up with Gilead, who dominates the market, with the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of the laboratory work for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed forces say Membich is completely controlled by the Islamic State.
On Friday, a group spokesman said U.S.-backed forces had also taken full control of the northern city of Membich, near the Turkish border.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are in the process of clearing the city after a group of remaining militants have also left hiding in the city.
Sharfan Dervis of the Membic Military Council, which is allied with the SDF, told Routers that they had released more than 2,000 civilian hostages themselves in the hands of militants.
He told Routers: “The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting cleaning work.”
The Clinton family earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton announced her 2015 tax return showing that the Democratic presidential nominee and his wife made $10.75 million last year and paid a 34.2 percent federal tax.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to charities, most of them to the Clinton Foundation, with former president Bill Clinton earning about $5.3 million from speech fees, and the former foreign minister declaring $3 million in revenue for his book coming out of the Simon <0x26> Schuster publishing house on his time in the State Department.
US Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia has filed a 10-year tax return with his wife Anne Holton.
In 2015, they paid 20.3% of federal taxes.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
Donald Trump, on the other hand, hides behind false pretenses about his promise to disclose his tax returns first and steps back.
Although not required by law, it is a tradition for U.S. presidential candidates to publicly present their tax returns.
Trump and his lawyers, a New York businessman, said the reason for the refusal to publish the statements was an audit conducted by the Revenue Administration.
In connection with the Democratic nominee’s statements, Clinton campaigner Ian Sams tweeted “You’re Next.”
On Thursday, Trump’s special trial attorney Michael Cohen told CNN he would not allow Trump to broadcast them until inspections were completed.
Criticizing Trump in 2012, including Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and other Republicans, the group said the rejection posed questions about his own existence, his contributions to charities, business deals, and many other connections, including those with Russia.
Clinton went over this by posting an online video Friday showing senior Republicans pressuring Trump to disclose his taxes.
He addressed this issue in an economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
He told the crowd, “For decades, he refuses to do what every presidential candidate does, to publish his tax returns.”
Politico reported that Trump had paid almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, a New York Times business columnist shared statements from a number of tax lawyers and accountants that the situation might still be going on that way.
Federal tax rates have become a major problem in the presidential election.
Clinton presented a rule proposal named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would enable those who earn over $1 million a year to pay at least 30 percent of taxes.
President Obama supports this proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, the Berkshire Hathaway group, operating there, challenged him to come to Trump and submit his tax return.
Buffett said he was also undergoing an IRS audit and that Trump was “scared” of voters, not the tax collection agency.
Clinton published tax returns until 2007 in her campaign.
The Clinton family, currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of about 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, with a combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clinton family’s statement for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only about $100 of their income comes from wages.
Its main investment is a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clinton family has declared dividend and interest revenues to be $109,000.

Powdered red pepper condoms, chestnut flares support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human settlements; they throw condoms full of powdered red peppers at them.
The method proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation and the U.S.-based Nature Conservancy, which came up with the idea a few years ago, took steps to promote it, educating volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent, four-step method of protecting their homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, most people used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
Damian Bell, managing director of Honeyguide, said in a statement: “We’ve seen a change in attitude in these communities since we developed the kit; they are now more self-confident that they can keep elephants out of their land without harming the elephants.”
The first two steps involve holding a passing net lantern and honking.
When this is not possible, the so-called "red pepper cloud" is thrown away.
Powdered red pepper mixed with soil is put in a condom with a chestnut flare, only the end of the detonator is closed so that it remains open.
When burned, the condom opens with the sound of an explosion and dusty red pepper is poured into the air.
One breath is enough to send the elephants in the opposite direction.
The last resort is to use a catapult that throws fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker hits hotel in Berlin that removes Israel's phone code on Arab "request" - RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin has sparked a sensation in the media after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not list Israel’s phone code and the employee is proposing “requests” from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, co-writer of the documentary "Shoah" about the genocide, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German publication FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes provided by the hotel at his recent stay.
However, the country was not among the states that could be searched directly from the room.
In 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, how can Israel be eliminated and destroyed?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its call center.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel’s reception to get an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that the response he received "shocked him".
The hotel's secretary said the measure was taken "in an intentional decision by the Kempinski-Hotels administration".
The underlying cause of this movement caused the filmmaker to become much more angry.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, “Most of our guests wanted the Arab and Israel’s code deleted.”
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the incident as a "great embarrassment."
We were horrified and very surprised.
It's a real shame.
It’s even more shameful that this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this.
That doesn't have to be explained.
We expect the hotel to draw the necessary conclusions from this," the official said.
The incident sparked a massive reaction online, people described it as a scandal.
Some have accused the Kempinski Hotel of "succumbing" to the so-called demands of its Arab customers.
Another post stated that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm street, near a synagogue, "You should be ashamed".
According to Der Spiegel, the Hotel quickly dismissed these accusations, saying that the incident was the result of "inattention" and apologizing to Lanzmann.
One of Kempinski's representatives said in a statement that "there has never been a direct order not to be included in Israel's quick search list."
He added that they have added the code.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against Brazilian students
Students gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Thursday to protest against the government's reforms in the public education system, clashed with police.
Police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against protesters.
The problem started when police officers tried to disperse the students, which led to police using plastic bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students attended the demonstration to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin has proposed that less than 100 public schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be dispatched to other schools.
Some of the protesters were seen writing on the walls against interim President Michel Temer.
This last protest took place a few days after protesters took to the streets to support the deposed President Dilma Rousseff, who was dismissed by a vote of the country's senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran rises to 71% - RT Business
According to Levan Dzhagaryan, Russia's ambassador to Iran, the lifting of sanctions and trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
The ambassador said that since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, the interest of Russian companies doing business in the country has increased significantly.
While new companies are preparing to provide access to the market, Russian companies continue to maintain existing ties with Iran.
Of course, increasing trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russia’s imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
This increase in trade has been achieved with machinery, ground vehicles and supplies for weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to come to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them for travel.
For the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia.
“We can say that the Iranian tourist record that visited Russia last year will be broken.”
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, a subject the ambassador hopes to change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved," he said.
FETO cash from <0xC4><0xB0>zmir - Economic News
Interesting details about Abdullah Kavuk, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Kavuklar Group, who was detained for providing financial support to FET<0xC3><0x96>, and Ahmet Küçükbay, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Küçükbay Group, began to be revealed.
FETO's financial sources No. 1 and 2 in <0xC4><0xB0>zmir have been determined that Küçükbay and Kavuk regularly send large amounts of money to Fetullah Gülen, leader of the FETO/PDY terrorist organization.
It was found that the money sent to Gülen for not registering was not deposited through banks and was sent through a member of the organization by courier.
On the other hand, 9 people who were taken into custody as part of the investigation into the FETO coup attempt in Amasya, who were transferred to the court, including Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Fatih Alt<0xC4><0xB1>nay, were arrested and 7 were released on the condition of judicial control.
<0xC2><0xA3>30,000 in the next 10 years
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's call to "reduce interest" has been activated by banks.
It was proposed that banks should be involved in the campaign attack initiated by Real Estate Housing and later attended by GYODER.
The proposal to reduce the housing loan interest rates, which are considered a psychological limit, to less than 1%, was made by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Thirteen banks have raised interest rates on housing loans to less than 1%.
It was the public banks that started the discount sale.
With the latest regulation, based on monthly interest rates ranging from 1.12 percent to 1.29 percent, consumers using 10-year housing loans will pay less interest between 15 and 30 billion TL.
PREFERENCE 5 TO 10 YEARS
So how much advantage will interest rates bring to home buyers?
A person who uses a 10-year loan of 10 thousand liras will gain an advantage of 30,000 liras from a decrease in interest.
The vast majority of home loan users choose a 5-10-year payment plan.
Interest rates are expected to fall further in the coming days.
Interest reduction will also have a positive impact on sales.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6% compared to the previous year, to 1 million 289 thousand.
Sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million this year.
GYODER President Saint Torun: It should be reduced to less than 9% per annum
It's an important step for public banks to go down the interest rate.
They listened to our president’s call and lowered the interest rates.
However, this rate should fall below 9% per annum.
If this discount process continues, we are also considering extending the 0.70% monthly campaign we started for a few months.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Crowdfunding: Our campaign could last for three months
The participation of banks in this initiative to bring vitality to the economy that we have restricted as a month could raise the possibility of extending the duration of this historic campaign for at least three to four months.
However, interest rates must fall below 9% on an annual basis.
With the positive psychology and unprecedented solidarity that this will create only in the housing sector and the real market, it is a pleasure to see that every sector makes sacrifices in the purchase of housing by citizens.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It is a good step to go to the interest rate reduction on our President's call to the banks.
Apart from this, there are a number of steps taken to revive the economy in all sectors.
The NGOs' campaigns, the decision taken by the Central Bank and all the steps taken in this direction for the country...
All banks need to put their hands under the rock.
Come to them, join us in this mobilization, walk with us, along the same path, together, hand in hand to give life to the economy.
1.5 billion TL investment from Sabanc<0xC4><0xB1> in 1.5 years
Sabanc<0xC4><0xB1> Holding increased its net profit in the first 6 months of this year by 11 percent compared to the same period of last year to 1 billion 353 million liras and increased its sales to 17 billion 166 million liras with an increase of 22 percent.
Zafer Kurtul, CEO of Sabanc<0xC4><0xB1> Holding, reported that they invested 1.8 billion TL in the first six months of the year and about 5.5 billion TL since the beginning of 2015.
He said, “We have been through a difficult period in the past as a country.
“After that, it’s time for more work and production for our country,” he said.
A two-year hiatus from Cape Cod
Due to the "Kabata<0xC5><0x9F> Square Arrangement, Transfer Center and Docks Renovation Construction" carried out by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (<0xC4><0xB0>BB), the Kabata<0xC5><0x9F> ferry ports were closed to sea traffic for about two years.
A modern transfer center will be built on the coast of Kabata<0xC5><0x9F> to integrate sea, rail system and road transport.
Traffic will be grounded and uninterrupted pedestrian flow will be provided along the coast.
Tram and funicular systems will continue to operate for a while.
Ring flights will be launched in order to provide citizens with access to Taksim, Eminönü, Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> regions.
The house collapsed, the house collapsed.
A friend of mine, the manager of a public bank, texted me.
It's always the same.
Interest rates are falling, home prices are rising.
Interest rates are rising, home prices are falling.
He says, "Look, it happened again."
He talks about the sensations that come to him because his business is about personal loans.
He says that the contractors who entered the 0.70 percent campaign organized by Real Estate Housing have increased prices in many housing projects.
I was checking to see if there was any truth.
There is a shortage, no more...
In the meantime, I had a conversation with a contractor who attended the construction summit held by our newspaper a week after the coup attempt of the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization on July 15.
The boss of a big company...
When I heard from a contractor whose name I'm not going to name, "You really need to raise prices by 10 percent," I said, "Are you going to be an opportunist?"
Following the coup attempt, the Emlak Housing-led campaign led the builders to launch a large sales campaign with a 0.70 percent and a 120-month term.
I admit, he put his hand under the rock before the banks, took the risk.
But since we are acting in a spirit of unity and solidarity in order not to slow down the pace of Turkey.
Your one-month campaign has also been supported by the banks by lowering interest rates.
Then no one gets a raise.
And warn those who do so among you.
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an accepted <0xC3><0x96>mer Koç and Ali Koç
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received Omar Mehmet Koç, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Koç Holding, and Ali Koç, Deputy Chairman of Koç Holding and Chairman of Ford Otosan Board of Directors.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's acceptance of the presidential complex, which was closed to the press, took 40 minutes.
Call from BDDK: Complain about those banks
Chairman of the Banking Regulatory and Supervisory Authority (BDDK) Mehmet Ali Akben made a statement on President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's warning of "returning credit" to banks.
"If banks turn credit recall into opportunism because of the market conditions and do it with different motives, we will certainly not allow it," Akben said.
We say to those who bring such complaints and information to us, ‘By giving names on the basis of the Bank and company, apply to the BDDK complaint line.’
President Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an warned the banks in a statement yesterday: "I say that a new era will open in front of both investors and our banks when interest rates drop and credit opportunities are expanded."
In addition to refusing to give out loans during this period of our country, the banks that call back loans on false pretexts have set themselves a rank, and I would like to announce this.
When interest rates were 7-8% per annum, banks earned money from these jobs.
More than 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
Ali K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>lda<0xC4><0x9F>, Chairman of the Professional Hotel Managers Association (POYD), stated that Turkey-Russia relations have taken a positive course before the 15 July coup attempt in the exhibition area of EXPO 2016 Antalya, scheduled flights from Russia to Antalya have started and there has been a certain revival in tourism.
The meeting between President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an and Russian President Vladimir Putin excited the tourism sector as well as the trade sectors between the two countries, K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>lda<0xC4><0x9F> said, "I expect very positive developments for all sectors, both in terms of tourism and from agriculture to food, from construction to textiles."
Turkey and Russia are two very close countries, we have traditional relations based on years.
“As sectors, I think that if we make very rapid progress on this path opened by the leaders of the two countries, we can close the distances and move towards the targets as soon as possible,” he said.
K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>lda<0xC4><0x9F>, who said that if there were no coup attempt, the number of Russian tourists coming to Turkey would exceed 1 million, continued:
But we lost a month in what we call the high season, so the goal is to reduce.
I still think that if charter flights start, we will exceed 500,000.
It can also be extended until the end of October or mid-November.
In such a case, additional flights may be placed towards Christmas.
I expect that this positive weather will be very well appreciated by the Russian people.
They also have a passion for Turkey.
With this acceleration, I hope that we will be able to push the 700 thousand.
K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>lda<0xC4><0x9F> expressed hope for 2017 in terms of the Russian market, said that if the relations between the two countries as well as the Russian economy recover, the number of Russian tourists could rise to more than 3 million again next year.
POYD President K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>lda<0xC4><0x9F>, stating that the domestic reservations started small with the lifting of the permission ban on public personnel, "There are returnes on canceled reservations, new reservations have started to be received."
“We have high hopes for the holiday,” he said.
K<0xC4><0xB1>z<0xC4><0xB1>lda<0xC4><0x9F> said that the lifting of the ticket sale ban imposed by Iran to travel agencies after the coup attempt was a very positive development, adding that "it would be very good if we could bring 100-200 thousand people from Iran in 1.2-2 months."
Renew the existing loan?
First of all, talk to the bank where you received the loan and find out how the new interest conditions affect your loan.
Calculate from your bank the cost of using a new loan at a lower interest rate with an early closing fee (up to 1.5-2 percent of the usual fee).
If you are still advantageous when you include all the costs, you can apply for a low-interest loan.
Don't let the lion breathe!
Besiktas, the last champion, aims to enter the new season morally by winning the Super Cup he will play with Galatasaray.
Technical Director <0xC5><0x9E>enol Güne<0xC5><0x9F>, who built all his plans on the win, said in his meeting with his students, "We must play fast and aggressive."
"I expect high pass percentage and 90 minutes of ball control from you," he said.
It was learned that <0xC5><0x9E>enol Güne<0xC5><0x9F>, who did not intend to drive the players who missed the trainings, especially Sosa, was unstable about Adriano and Quaresma.
The experienced trainer tried Necip in the stopper during the week, but if Adriano plays in the left beak, Tosic will play in the stopper.
The Sun, which would make a choice between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also made its students run the ball after a long break.

I AM NOT THE FOOTBALLERS TO TALK

After two or three weeks, I’ll see if I can win the championship.
I'm waiting for an explosion from Tolga.
You will see Tolga with his stance, his physique, this year it will explode, everyone will watch it with admiration.
Galatasaray President emphasized that they had contacted Mehmet Topal during the transfer period, but they would only come into play if he did not agree with his club, and he said: "We did not intend to be loaded so that our opponent would increase the price."
Mehmet Topal is a gentleman, a master athlete.
If he didn’t agree with the club, we’d want to transfer him to Galatasaray.
Riva will end its banking debts
Uzbek stated that they will start construction of the hall next to TT Arena soon, "We wanted to build a hall for 13,000 people."
But our president said, “Build a hall for 15,000 people.”

“As a football family, we have to clean and clean our own garden,” he said.
On the question "Do you think of an organization under the name of the 15 July Democracy Cup?", Gümü<0xC5><0x9F>da<0xC4><0x9F> said, "Especially about the name of the Turkish Cup, there is a general consensus among friends."

President Aziz Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m and the board of directors held a meeting with the club's Financial Affairs Coordinator Tamer Yelkovan.
The economic dimension of the event was discussed at the meeting.
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m, who was sensitive to keeping the "yearly loss" at a level under the agreement with UEFA, was reported to have received financial assistance from Yelkovan.
We contacted Pereira's representatives.
He was notified that his mission would be terminated.
2-2.5 Million Euro Dealers
There are still some unsolved issues on financial issues, so the official announcement will be made today or tomorrow.
Pereira and his team went to practice with the team yesterday because there was no official announcement.
The total cost of this operation was around 4 million euros.
However, it was stated that the F.Baçe will reach an agreement on a figure below this price for the termination.
If F.Baçe pays Pereira in advance, he will finish the job with between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.5 million.
If Pereira refuses, his salary will be paid on a monthly basis.
If he makes a deal with a team, the payment will be deducted.
Yes, Pereira finally left and Fenerbahçe’s supporters signed a major revolution.
In the war with Vitor Pereira, Caner Erkin, Luis Nani was martyred.
Robin van Persie was rescued with minor injuries.
I’m glad that Vitor Pereira is gone, and I think our administration will go and find something worse.
My joy's on my lap.
Pereira is the champion of Fenerbahçe.
You can pack your Vitor Pereira suitcase with 3-5-2 and go.
Since Pereira is gone, she's 18.

FETO leader Gülen's assets were confiscated
Adana Prosecutor General’s Office of Terror-Technical and Organized Crimes Investigation Office prepared an indictment to finance the terrorist organization FET<0xC3><0x96>/PDY by increasing the value of the real estate belonging to persons and organizations associated with FET<0xC3><0x96>/PDY in an extraordinarily large amount with irregularly changed plans. 17 suspects in Adana 2nd Criminal Court
In the trial in which Fetullah Gülen, the No. 1 defendant, was tried for ‘attempting to abolish the constitutional order’, the court board issued an arrest warrant against the fugitives Omar Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu.
However, the court has decided to conduct the illegal proceedings for the four fugitives who have not been caught and who have not come to the hearings so far.
Adana 2nd Heavy Penal Court decided to confiscate all assets of Fetullah Gülen, <0xC3><0x96>mer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in a foreign country in order to ensure that their case was unsuccessful and therefore could not reach him, in accordance with Article 278/1 of the Penal Trial Code (CMC).
With this decision of the court, the property of the fugitive defendants in Turkey, land-sea and air transportation vehicles, all kinds of rights and receivables, valuable documents, shares of the company with which he is a partner, cash registers and bank accounts have been frozen.
Hussein Gülerce: The collapse of Gülen depends on the collapse of three feet
Hussein Gülerce, who interpreted FET<0xC3><0x96>'s coup attempt, made striking statements.
This is what Hussein Gülerce said:
As I thought they would try to strike, I wrote about it in my writings for the last 5-6 months, "They may try, but they can't do it in the chain of command."
I didn’t know two things; the first was that it was widespread and deep in this scale, for example, the gendarmerie commander’s 8-year-old deputy officer and the aides of the President.
Mr. President, the person who struggles the most, who knows how he has paid attention when choosing his aides, but the most important feature of them is unprecedented secrecy.
They're very hypocritical.
“This is not the work that a retired preacher like FET<0xC3><0x96> can do,” one of the most important evidences of this is that it is such a deep conspiracy.
He's getting support from the CIA.
The CIA took this person too early.
Mahmut <0xC3><0x96>vur said in 2014 that in 1971, at Vehbi Koç's house, Fuat <0xC3><0x96>stü met with Fetullah Gülen.
He says that the people who were most interested in these matters at that time were the closest to the relationship between the MIT and the CIA.
The U.S. paid the salary of our armed forces personnel, and after not remembering them, one man came out like this.
When do we learn this in 2014?
After this letter from Mr. Mahmoud, there was no explanation for this.
Or maybe he’s just caught in the crossfire, isn’t he?
I wonder who this is.
He's been to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup, and he came back two days ago.
He has been abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all these together, it is necessary to investigate which of them went to the U.S. on an excuse since March 1999, when all those who have fled to the U.S. went to Fetullah Gülen.
They'll see that they've been to Pennsylvania on an occasion.
But their real contact with the CIA can be determined from here: there have been a lot of people who have been sent to the U.S. safely, especially from people who need to be raised from within the security.
Wikileaks has it in its documents; Gülen is building an association and holding joint meetings with the CIA.
Fifteen years ago, the CIA was working to formally establish those connections.
I said Fuat Avni is an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania two years ago.
The man in the prime minister works for Fuat Avni.
But the bad news is that this information fell to the CIA just as it fell to Pennsylvania.
The fall of Gülen depends on the collapse of three feet; one of which is what we call the base, which is a circle of friends, there are those who are deeply hypnotized, and they say that even this coup attempt is still Erdogan's film.
Three feet, I mean, a sole support.
The theft of questions, the theft, the defeat of slaves, this base support was very shaken.
The other two feet: political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that will break political support is documenting that the tapes of Baikal and MHP executives were shot by FET<0xC3><0x96>.
After July 15, Mr. K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu used "FETO" and opened the eyes of everyone.
He laughs and says, “I don’t do it, I do it all the time.”
He says next to me, “Yahu Hussein Bey, these girls have very different dreams, they send them to me, and I have forbidden them now, because it is not right to perform them with dreams.”
A voice recording had fallen, Barbaros Kocakurt, the person who spoke on that voice recording: “Teacher friends have been dreaming, our Prophet has been tweeting twice.
A police officer was killed in Nusaybin.
According to the information received, the armored vehicle, which was patrolling the Saladin Eyyubi neighborhood, was shot with long-barreled weapons by terrorists.
In the first fire, a police officer was killed and a police officer was injured.
Two terrorists were neutralized in the clash that followed the cops' retaliation.
The injured policeman was taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
Operation continues in the area.
The TV stations did not stop broadcasting.
On the night of July 15, private televisions, which had an important part in preventing the coup attempt, continued to broadcast thanks to a technical staff who heroically resisted coup attempts in Turksat.
This is the heroine of Asim Akkaya...
Akkaya, who stated that they entered the psychology of resistance with the order to cut the broadcast during the reading of the statement in TRT, "I risked everything thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire that was opened from the helicopter."
They put a gun to my head and asked me to cut broadcasts.
I just turned off the local TV.
Then I made them move away from the building, telling them we had to go to the dish antennas.
I spent about 20 minutes in the antenna section.
"I cut some cables here again, but I didn't touch the transmissions," he said.
When the coup d'état failed to cut the broadcast in Turksat, they brought in specialists from Milky Way TV.
These terrorists were arrested by police three minutes ago.
When the strikers returned to the building, about an hour later, they realized that the telephone and TV broadcasts that came to them continued, and Akkaya, who stated that he was facing death at that moment, told them what they had experienced:
I took over the night shift at 8:00 that night.
It was in our hands.
One of my friends was on duty for the e-government and the electrical system.
When we met for tea around 9:00 p.m., helicopters flew over us.
There were several other low-flying aircraft around the helicopter.
We saw the lights.
It was probably unmanned aerial vehicles that could capture images.
They flew in front of the helipads.
I've been there for 11 years, and this is the first time I've seen such close flights.
Then a movement began.
Watching the news, we found out the bridge was closed.
In the meantime, our general manager gave instructions to friends in security who were not working overtime at the time to come to the building.
On our way to the station for information, we learned that the packages of all the broadcasts on TRT had fallen.
TRT broadcasts were interrupted for 5 minutes.
I tried to call the TRT main controller, but I couldn't reach it.
Our control station said that the TRT broadcasts have returned and the declaration has begun to be read.
Our Deputy General Manager Halil Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilç<0xC4><0xB1>men requested that TRT broadcasts be stopped immediately at the order of the General Manager.
Since TRT broadcasts a wide range of 3 channels, we started to work to be able to cut the broadcast.
We have just heard Prime Minister Binali Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m say there is a “disaster.”
Our director's order to cut the TRT has put us in some resistance psychology.
We cut off the TRT, and after a while we heard the helicopter sound.
We went out, the helicopter that landed at the station fired everywhere, and everyone dispersed.
We hid in a building in the back.
We were a total of 12 people.
When we got to the back, the soldiers from the helicopter came in.
Some of our friends were captured by the soldiers.
We came out here to not leave them alone.
At that moment, I saw them capture our deputy general manager and get him on his knees.
The soldiers were talking among themselves.
“Let’s shoot one of them, let’s scare them,” someone said.
Then they put us all in.
Their commanders started yelling, "Who's in charge here, I'm not going to ask again."
When we heard the words, “Let’s shoot someone,” we thought: “We don’t know about the country, but an order came to us, ‘Stop TRT.’”
So there is resistance.
At that moment, I felt like I was giving up my life.
I said, "It's me."
I stood up without knowing what to do at that moment.
All I could think about at the time was that my friends were shot from the helicopter.
I thought 10-15 friends were martyrs in the order, and when I thought 'they're going to kill us sooner or later', I felt a sense of relief.
“You will cut off all broadcasts except TRT,” the commander in chief said.
We've got a system section where we monitor local channels when they're on the satellite.
We're broadcasting 80 of the 200 local channels from that room.
This room came to mind.
There was no national broadcasting among them.
If I cut them off and say they're all cut off, at least until then, support or outside help will come.
Or I said it would go as far as where it went.
We finally agreed we couldn't get out of there.
I said, "Okay, I'll cut it."
I cut off the antenna out of one of the local channel packets.
I cut off the power switch to the monitors we can monitor on national channels.
There was no signal on all the screens.
I said I had to go to the antenna so it could be completely cut.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, and one of the soldiers said, "Stay there."
He put the gun on my forehead.
“You’ll cut them all off except TRT, there won’t be any left, I’ll shoot one of you eventually, that’ll be you.”
And now that I've died, I've said with ease, 'You'll see when they're gone, they'll all be frozen,' and I didn't say anything else.
We walked into the station, stalled and cut off local broadcasts.
We switched to the other antenna.
At that time, I had a system that corresponded to about 20 national channels.
When the local channels were cut off, about 20 monitors were wasted.
“Our Lord helped us, and we did not have any difficulty in responding to them, but He made them understand.
They believed our answers.
They didn't.
That's a relief.
After leaving the antenna, they asked where the transformer was.
“I don’t know, I’m a TV broadcaster,” he asked, “Is there an electrician among you?”
“I said, ‘There’s no electrician after work, if there’s a fault, the team will come.’
There was an electrician at the time.
I thought I didn't cut out the Cypriot broadcasts.
I was thinking of cutting them off to keep the soldiers busy.
They were a little relieved that they thought the broadcasts were cut.
They couldn’t look at the broadcasts.
The group is now waiting.
About an hour later, when they turned on the TV in the waiting room, they saw A News broadcast.
He's in, soldier.
“My commander did not interrupt the news broadcast.
We've been eye-catching with the commander.
He said, “Stand up.”
I'm up.
At that moment, a soldier said, "There are still broadcasts going on."
"There are channels broadcasting in Cyprus," he said.
"They're broadcasting through Cyprus, we can't do anything to them," I said.
He said, “After he wrote to someone, he raised us all up and walked.”
The militants fled from Turksat by minibus.
The soldier who took me to the toilet and gave me water, I saw from the photos, he was executed in the seat of that van.
They fired three shots in the forehead and cheeks.
My friends confirmed that he was the same soldier.
They called this soldier "son" with us.
He was probably a soldier.
They could have executed him to get rid of him.
According to As<0xC4><0xB1>m Akkaya's statements, the first police team came to Turksat from Gölba<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>.
When police officers found out there were helicopters in the area and security guards were scanned, they went back to the county to pick up ammunition.
They came back 40 minutes later.
When the police officers arrived, they could not see anyone in the Turksat external order.
Just 3-4 minutes after the police arrived at the building, the so-called experts sent from the Milky Way TV said, "They called us from inside, we are Turksat staff, we need to enter urgently."
“When the police asked for identification, all four of them hurriedly hugged their phones and reported that they had been ‘captured’,” he said.
The spirit of the mountain after the
In early September, the AK Party will land in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, Van and Mardin with a large delegation, including businessmen, artists, athletes and opinion leaders, to establish “heart bridges” with citizens in the region.
AK Party is preparing to move its "Yenikapi spirit" to Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, which is formed by democratic seizures following the bloody coup attempt of the FETO/PDY junta.
Before the Eid al-Adha, the heads of the provinces of CHP and MHP will be invited to the aid campaign in the Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia regions.
The AK Party, which will deliver the message "The State and the people are with you" to the people of the region, will provide assistance to poor families and those in need.
The Gönül Bridge Project, which was held for the first time in the month of Ramadan, was discussed at the AK Party’s last MYK meeting.
During the meeting, which evaluated the positive results of the project for the affected families, especially young people and children in the region, it was decided to continue the Gönül Bridge at the Sacrifice Feast.
The work began under the chairmanship of the Vice President, President of Civil Society Public Relations Mehmet Muezzino<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
Accordingly, 12 provinces in the East and Southeast will meet in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, Mardin and Van.
These three meetings will be held before the holiday.
Businessmen, artists, athletes and opinion leaders will also participate in the events.
During these meetings, the organization of aids and studies will be discussed.
On the occasion of Eid al-Fitr, the delegations of famous names will deliver the aid to the citizens themselves.
Children and young people will be given holiday allowances, and school needs will be met in this way as schools are opened after the holiday.
Sacrifice will be distributed to those in need.
After July 15, the air of national unity against the coup between AK Party, CHP and MHP will be reflected in this project.
12 CHP and MHP provincial presidents of the provinces included in the project will also be invited to the organizations.
The three parties will co-operate in the relief efforts.
It is considered that the HDP is not invited to the events as in Yenikap<0xC4><0xB1>.
The father-in-law of the fair orphan
FETO's father-in-law and his mother-in-law, who were listed as number one in the July 15 coup attempt, were arrested and sent to court.
Father-in-law Cevat Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m and mother-in-law Hatice Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m were released by the court on the condition of judicial control and foreign exit ban.
When he reached the courtroom, he called his son-in-law to surrender and said, “I am on the side of the state.”
God damn the bastards.
I don’t really know the person I’ve known for 18 years.
I don't have a fair orphan son-in-law.
I want him caught soon.
In this way, he cannot live in Turkey, nor in the world.
Let him trust in Turkish justice.
If he makes a mistake, he'll pay.
It bothers us to run away.
Too bad for the police, too bad for the state.
For 20-25 days, the police did nothing else.
Turkey does not want to return to Syria, Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m said, “We do not need a coup, we need work.”
We don’t want Turkey to go and be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
There is a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
And he said, “What are we doing with this?”
On the other hand, the last time <0xC3><0x96>k<0xC3><0x96>z<0xC4><0xB1>z was seen crossing the TEM Highway Akyaz at 03:00 on July 19th, he disappeared after leaving his 'SIR' license plate in his father's garage in Akyaz<0xC4><0xB1>.
FETO operation at university: 30 detainees
Within the scope of the investigation conducted in Izmir on the university structure of the Fethullahist terrorist organization, the button for the operation was pressed this morning.
In the operation carried out by <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Financial Crimes Division Directorate to <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Katip <0xC3><0x87>elebi University, 30 of the 40 university members whose detention decision was made were detained at their address.
Among the names of those detained in the operation carried out under the instructions of the Izmir General Prosecutor's Office are professors.
The names of the detainees were interrogated at the Financial Crimes Division.
Other names are being searched.
Prosecutor tried to commit suicide
According to the information received, the teams of the District Police Directorate wanted to arrest Viran<0xC5><0x9F>ehir Prosecutor Ahmet Fi<0xC5><0x9F>ne in his office as part of the investigation.
He then claimed that he would kill himself with his gun on his head.
She refused to commit suicide, convinced by her colleagues and her husband, who came to the courthouse.
The detainee was taken to the county police department.
Smoking ban in parks and sports
Bilecik Mayor Selim Ya<0xC4><0x9F>c<0xC4><0xB1> said at the signing ceremony held at the Sheikh Edebali Culture and Congress Center that they added a clause to the police regulation on non-smoking in the parks, sports and playgrounds.
Ya<0xC4><0x9F>c<0xC4><0xB1> reiterated that they had met with all public institutions managers to sign protocols for the future of new generations and wished that the protocol would be good for children and young people.
Provincial Health Director Yasin Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz also stated that the protocol aims to get people to quit smoking and remove young people from bad habits.
Following the speeches, Mayor Ya<0xC4><0x9F>c<0xC4><0xB1>, Sheikh Edebali University Rector Prof. Dr. <0xC4><0xB0>brahim Ta<0xC5><0x9F>, Provincial Director of National Education Faisilet Durmu<0xC5><0x9F>, Provincial Health Director Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, Provincial Public Health Director <0xC3><0x96>mer Balc<0xC4><0xB1>, Deputy Secretary of Public Hospitals Serkan Kadir Keskin and Vice President of Bilecik Branch of Green Crescent.
In Ergenekon, he saw a conspiracy, killed FET<0xC3><0x96>
Ankara's Prosecutor General's Office is investigating the role of FET<0xC3><0x96> in the mysterious death of Special Operations Department Head Behcet Oktay, whose case was closed in 2009 for "suicide".
The former head of the Security Intelligence Department, Ramadan Akyurek, who stayed in the same residence as Oktay and heard Oktay as a suspect of the Hezbollah Terrorist Organization six days before he died, is the main suspect in the investigation.
Some of the ammunition seized during the Ergenekon investigation was allegedly stolen and buried by the FETO security team from the Special Operations Department, which Oktay identified.
The death of Behcet Oktay, who was shot in the head in Ankara on February 25, 2009, was called "suicide".
But there were a lot of question marks in the case.
As a result of the legal struggle of his family and family lawyers and the evidence he presented, two years later, this time the murder investigation was opened.
Oktay, who was left-handed, had the gun in his right hand that was said to have shot him.
They also found fractures in the ribs and bruise marks on his body.
The case for the murder investigation was opened in May 2012.
In the murder case, only Halil Kesici, who was present at the time of his death and had a gunpowder mark on his hand, was tried.
Cutter's trial was finally acquitted.
Nurhan <0xC3><0x96>nder, who was in prison for another crime and said he was involved in Oktay's death by sending a letter to the prosecutor, was sentenced to six months in prison for "crime and misrepresentation of the judicial authorities".
YOU ARE INQUIRED FOR THESE DAVIDS
Meanwhile, Prosecutor Hussein Yalçin, who called the incident "suicide", was retired, while Mustafa Düzgülü, who conducted the murder investigation, was promoted to the Supreme Court.
The Oktay family wants the autopsy prosecutor Nihat Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m to be investigated along with these prosecutors.
Behçet Oktay's sister, Shule Oktay, and her brother, Nezih Oktay, and family lawyers made many requests during the trial.
The family said it was impossible for Halil Kesci to kill the specially trained Oktay alone, and demanded an extension of the investigation.
Prosecutors Hüseyin Yalç<0xC4><0xB1>n and Mustafa <0xC3><0x96>zgün and Behçet demanded that law enforcement officers who wanted to close the Oktay case as a suicide should be identified and tried.
While all the family's demands were denied, it turned out that Oktay was heard six days before his death as a member of the Hezbollah Terrorist Organization under the pseudonym "Abdurrahman Yük".
It was determined that the person who made the hearing was the head of the Security Intelligence Department at the time, Ramadan Akyurek.
Upon this development, the Ankara Prosecutor General's Office, which reconsidered the Behçet Oktay case, began to examine the finger of the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization (FET<0xC3><0x96>) in the murder.
The case against Oktay's illegal detention in Ankara Heavy Penal Court will begin on September 19.
THERE'S A NATURAL FET<0xC3><0x96>
The Oktay family, whom Sabah met in the morning, are hopeful of the current investigation.
Family members say that the FET<0xC3><0x96> finger in the murder was covered during the previous showy investigation and trial.
Sister Shule Oktay said, "This murder actually came to show."
We didn't get it.
My brother said he'd eat me before he was killed.
I said, "Who?"
Then he pointed to me.
I thought he was going to be dismissed.
I never thought about death.
There is, of course, a fetus behind this.
He said, “This is the time when they are in control.
He called the young man’s family and joined them in prayer.
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, after addressing the citizens in the courtyard of the Presidential Communion the previous evening, he also called the family of the democracy martyr <0xC3><0x96>mer Can Aç<0xC4><0xB1>kgöz through AK Party Sinop MP Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Mavi<0xC5><0x9F>.
Father Fahrettin Ak<0xC4><0xB1>ngöz, who stated that the phone came at 01.30 at night while they were praying for his son, "Our President also attended with his prayers."
“I said that our country and its health is important to us,” he said.
'Your health is important to us'
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an addressed the citizens in front of the Presidential Constituent Assembly the previous evening.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an met with some citizens in Külliye after his speech, which ended in the middle of the night.
Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, who walked together by the hand of an old aunt who came to the watch of democracy, had a one-on-one conversation with the citizens, took care of the children and thanked the citizens for their sacrifices.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then, through AK Party Sinop MP Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Mavi<0xC5><0x9F>, called Fahrettin A<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>kgöz, the father of 15 July martyr <0xC3><0x96>mer Can Aç<0xC4><0xB1>kgöz.
The father of 21-year-old TOBB University Law School student Omar Can, who was shot in front of the Presidential Assembly, Fahrettin A<0xC4><0x9F>ngöz, stated that President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was calling at 01.30 at night while praying for his son and martyrs, "When I said that we prayed for my son, Mr. President joined with his prayers."
I said that the health of our country and its people is very important to us.
“We are very pleased that our President has called and prayed on the phone,” he said.
FET<0xC3><0x96>'s pyramid has been destroyed
26 FET<0xC3><0x96> activists were arrested in <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Urla.
Among the detainees, according to the statements of the victims, there is also Kurtulu<0xC5><0x9F> Reip Hep<0xC4><0xB1>alç<0xC4><0xB1>n, who is referred to as the "mutegallibe" , i.e. tyrant within the organization and threatens those who want to terminate the subscription of Zaman newspaper.
20 of FET<0xC3><0x96>'s sister-in-laws were arrested in U<0xC5><0x9F>ak.
In Bursa, 24 people, including former Bursa Police Director Ali Osman Kahya, were taken to court.
DOCTOR RESULTS DEPARTED
In Edirne, the imam responsible for the doctors of the organization Ayd<0xC4><0xB1>n Tunbel was arrested.
14 professors at Denizli Pamukkale University 30, 19 academics at Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University, 2 academics at Karabuk University, FETO Lieutenant Colonel Hilmi Sandal was arrested in Rize.
In Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, 8 judges and prosecutors and 2 deputy governors and 2 governors were detained.
It was learned that one of the judges' detention proceedings took place in the courtroom.
In Batman, Deputy Governor <0xC5><0x9E>ener <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar was suspended.
Two police chiefs from 465 police officers who were detained in Istanbul Police have been arrested.
51 were arrested in Konya, 14 in Kayseri, 14 in Malatya, 10 in Siirt and 10 in Adana.
The traitor who shot people is protecting the PKK.
Turkey, which has been fighting relentlessly to end PKK terror for more than forty years, has begun to emerge on the day when it is unable to destroy the leaders of the organization in this struggle.
FET<0xC3><0x96> militants infiltrated Turkey's critical institutions have worked from all sides to tie Turkey's hands.
At this point, serious doubts and evidence began to emerge that FET<0xC3><0x96> was behind the Hrant Dink Murder, the Uludere incident, the crash of the Russian plane.
THE TREASURE IS SO MUCH MUCH MUCH
During the July 15 coup attempt, the record of FETO Brigadier General Gokhan <0xC5><0x9E>ahin Sönmeze<0xC5><0x9F>, who led the raid and assassination operation on President Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's hotel in Marmaris, turned out to be quite fluffy.
Earlier it was determined that Sönmeze<0xC5><0x9F> had notified terrorists of air operations to the PKK as the planes were taking off.
In the investigations carried out by intelligence units, it was determined that Gökhan Sönmeze<0xC5><0x9F> had a fluffy record.
PROTECTING TERRORISTS
In addition to leaking intelligence to the PKK, it was also noted that Turkish warplanes did not hit the targets set.
The point of intelligence provided by the MIT at the outskirts of Kandil about the leader of the terrorist organization PKK was alleged to have been deflected by Gökhan Sönmeze<0xC5><0x9F> and prevented the shooting of targets.
With the change of coordinates, it was determined that the fighter jets that flew to destroy the PKK's leading squadron hit the places on the side of the targets, and that the leaders of the terrorist organization were saved.
The intelligence investigation revealed that Sönmeze<0xC5><0x9F> played a key role in both deflecting targets and escaping PKK terrorists before the F-16s took off.
37,000 police officers have been released.
Following the repulsion of the FETO members' coup attempt under the leadership of the terrorist leader Fetullah Gülen, a process of restructuring was initiated in the TSK and the Ministry of National Defense.
In particular, when it became clear that the entrance questions to military high schools had been stolen by FETO and that non-member military students had been sent from schools, a thorough cleaning process was started.
With the latest exports, there are about 37,000 officers left from 39,287 officers, while the cleaning for generals and admirals will be carried out for these officers.
For this purpose, promotions will be frozen, especially in ranks ranging from lieutenants to colonels.
A thorough investigation will be completed before the promotion.
The files of 37,000 officers were opened one by one.
With a work of forty wounds, FET<0xC3><0x96> soldiers will be revealed.
Officers who have no connection with FET<0xC3><0x96> will continue their duties.
The fight will continue until the last FET<0xC3><0x96> fighter is cleared from the army, and the promotion of officers will only come after the investigation.
The investigation is carried out jointly by the MIT, Security Intelligence and the State Supervisory Board.
As part of the investigation, whether the officers were civilians or graduated from the war school, their ranks, promotions, where they served and their commanders are being investigated.
In addition, they will be investigated by a study of forty wounds on whether they are members of the FET<0xC3><0x96> even through their schemes.
All measures will be taken to ensure that officers who have no connection with FET<0xC3><0x96> are not negatively affected by the process.
In the event of the slightest doubt, the officer will be immediately suspended and taken to court.
Those who have found FET<0xC3><0x96> connection, those who have information and documents about them will be immediately cut off from the army.
While promotions are frozen during all these processes, the review will be deepened.
There will also be a need to make sure that there are no gaps in the post-export cadres.
Those who were expelled from the TSK with the FET<0xC3><0x96> conspiracy and those who were forced to retire will be able to return to their professions with the same self-righteousness as their colleagues and equivalent cadres after passing the security investigation if they want.
2 THOUSAND 133 SUBJECTS EXPORTED
The Chief of Staff announced the number of personnel of the TSK as 39,287 officers on July 1.
The majority of the 32,289 personnel in the class of officers, consisting of lieutenants, lieutenants, majors, commanders and colonels, were in the ground, air and navy.
On 27 July, however, the first wave was issued, with 726 officers dismissed, 314 in the Air Force and 59 in the Navy.
In the decree of 31 July, 1,304 more officers, 125 of whom were from Kara and 909 from Gendarmerie General Command, were cut off from the TSK.
Pilgrims: Turkey poisoned
MHP's founder and first president, Alparslan Türke<0xC5><0x9F>, retired Superintendent Tahsin Pehlivano<0xC4><0x9F>lu, said that Turke<0xC5><0x9F> was poisoned and killed, and that one of his family was doing this in collaboration with FET<0xC3><0x96>.
Pehlivano<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who was with Turkestan every moment from 1977 until 1997 when he died, said, "I have not told anyone until now, but after watching that soldier's image of Muhsin Yaz<0xC4><0xB1>c<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu slashing pieces from his helicopter and seeing that same soldier was in the coup d'états commissioned to kill our President, I had to talk."
Here’s what Turkey’s security guards say:
We went to Germany in 1997.
We had a check-up three days before we arrived.
The 33-year-old Burdurlu Doctor Fikret, who checked up, said, "You look like an 18-year-old."
He said, "You have nothing."
This doctor died of a heart attack a month later.
We returned to Ankara on April 3.
My prime minister went to Amasya.
They called me on my way back and went to an engagement in the Ankara Hilton.
After leaving the engagement, the Turkish driver said to Alparslan, "Open the back window."
He never opened a window.
When I open the window, I hear a sound.
At first, they had a heart massage at the <0xC3><0x87>ankaya Medical Center, but it was over.
We took him to the medical center together, but it was too late.
I think someone in the family poisoned Amasya.
There was no autopsy in Turkey.
His ex-wife, Seval Türke<0xC5><0x9F>, will have heard about my discomfort and my rhetoric, so he went out and made statements in defense of "Turkey was killed" and so on.
The human being is the one who opens the graves and makes the tombs.
They called it a heart attack.
Turkey's tomb should be re-opened.
Has Alparslan Turks been killed?
Arrested for smuggling gold to Pennsylvania!
The FETO/PDY was seized during the operation in Izmir for the establishment of businessmen under the weight of 1.5 kilograms, during the shipment to Pennsylvania.
During the operation, searches at the workplace revealed that 30 kilograms of gold were left waiting to be kidnapped in Pennsylvania.
Three people were arrested and sent to prison after the gold was prepared to be sent to Pennsylvania, where the businessman Mehmet Eldem was located in Eldem Kuyumculuk.
In addition, the businessmen detained in the operation carried out within the framework of the investigation carried out in Izmir, Mustafa <0xC3><0x96>zkara, Ezel Selected and the Messenger Selected were arrested.
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir Provincial Police Directorate Financial Crimes Department teams organized the operation on July 29 with Mustafa <0xC3><0x96>zkara, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Aegean and Western Mediterranean Industry and Businessmen Federation (<0xC4><0xB0>S<0xC4><0xB0>DEF) and <0xC4><0xB0>stanak Transit Transportation Oil and Tur. Tic. Ltd. (BALPET) Owners were Ezel Elected and Rasul Elected.
While trying to escape to Kyrgyzstan, it was determined that <0xC3><0x96>zkara, the President of <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Adnan Menderes Airport, was the son of Osman Gürbüz <0xC3><0x96>zkara, who was among Fetullah Gülen's first board of trustees, and was one of the most important names in the Aegean Region of FET<0xC3><0x96>.
It was also reported that the five fuel stations owned by other businessmen, Ezel and Rasul <0xC5><0x9E>el<0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>k, who were detained on the grounds that they provided financial resources to FET<0xC3><0x96> were also seized.
They robbed three gas stations in an hour.
The incident happened last night at the Eagle.
The two suspects who arrived at the Eagle in the vehicle they had hijacked first robbed another gas station 300 meters away after a gas station on the side road, then another station on the side road with a gun.
After the robberies, the Eagle police, which was alarmed, quickly identified the suspects and started the capture work.
Police teams are tracking the vehicle that C.S. and U.A. are driving.
The suspects, who were trying to escape from the vehicle they were using in the direction of Eagle Square, also fired at the police.
One of the suspects was caught stalking on Sovereign Boulevard after a pedestrian-only chase.
Based on the information the police received from C.<0xC5><0x9E>., the second suspect was quickly arrested.
The suspects were arrested and sent to prison after their operations at Kartal Asayish Bureau.
The masked robbery, on the other hand, was recorded by cameras.
In the footage shown on the security cameras of the gas station, the suspect first enters the gas station and then enters the market again, wearing masks and guns in the vehicle outside.
There's a struggle between the first indictee and the first incumbent who enters the market.
Following the attack by a market employee, the other person who was with him comes in with a mask and a gun on his head.
After disarming the employees, the suspect pulls out his gun and runs away with 6,200 liras in the safe.
During the top searches of the suspects, about 15,000 liras were seized from 3 stations, an unlicensed weapon and the vehicle they had seized again were seized.
7.2 magnitude earthquake in the Pacific Ocean
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake was recorded 10 kilometers deep in the seabed, 109 kilometers east of the New Caledonian Island.
The tsunami warning after the earthquake, which did not lead to loss of life and property, was canceled soon after.
Vanuatu, located in the "Pacific Fire Circle" earthquake belt, often has earthquakes.
He prayed for the unknowable.
The relatives of <0xC3><0x87>etin Can, 38, who was martyred on the night of July 15 at the Bo<0xC4><0x9F>aziçi Bridge, maintain their strength.
His wife, Fatma Can, told him that she had learned in a conversation about the martyrdom prayer performed in the month of Shawwal, and that she had prayed at home and advised him to perform this prayer.
After the prayer, Fatma Can told that they watched the news on television and learned about the coup attempt:
We packed up and went out.
When we got to the bridge, there were people waiting there.
As soon as we entered the bridge, the tank opened fire on us twice.
We took cover, and when the tank left, we continued to walk.
There was a bus stop on the bridge.
There was a lot of people there.
We stayed there for a while, waiting.
When we couldn’t move forward, we thought what to do.
He wanted us to go to the sidewalk.
On the side lane, I'm guessing he's a sniper, we're a clear target, and he's been shot.
After four hours of prayer, he turned to the Lord and prayed.
He didn't know about the coup.
The wisdom of God.
God is the giver, God is the receiver.
My wife used to say, “If I die, I plant a tree that bears fruit in my grave.”
I made this wish by planting a plum tree on his grave.
Fatma Can, noting that they were grateful to President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an for visiting them, said, “Allah be pleased with him.”
Skull and bone fragments were found in the plumbing excavation!
According to the information obtained, bone fragments were removed from the soil during the work of the construction machinery for laying electrical wiring in <0xC3><0x87>ankaya around 20.00 hours, next to the railway line located at the intersection of Faculty Neighborhood Yeni Ankara Street and Co<0xC5><0x9F>kunlar Street.
The workers and residents of the neighborhood reported the situation to the police.
Police units were dispatched to the scene.
The police, who saw 3 skulls and bone fragments released during the work of the construction machinery, informed the crime scene investigators.
After the work of the crime scene investigators, bone fragments were placed in bags and taken to the forensic medical institution.
Neighborhood residents claimed that an old cemetery had been found where the bones were removed, that slums were built over the cemetery in the 1960s, and that the slums were subsequently demolished.
Investigation of the incident has begun.
The return of Rita's killer could take four months.
The boyfriend of German hairdresser Rita Dar<0xC4><0xB1> Winkler (39), who was found dead in Gölcük 34 days after his disappearance in Istanbul, who was arrested in Germany 4 months later, may take four months to return to Turkey.
Winkler arrived in Turkey on Thursday (March 3rd) to meet her boyfriend Ali Kemal S. (46).
After meeting Ali Kemal S. in <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul Pendik, he disappeared as he was expected to return to Germany on Wednesday morning (March 9th).
As a result of investigations carried out by Istanbul Police on the disappearance of his family, suspicions were concentrated on Winkler's married boyfriend, Ali Kemal S.
On April 13, the Muge Anl<0xC4><0xB1> and Sweet Hard Program received a report that Ali Kemal S. had been excavated at work in Gölcük, which belonged to his brother Hüseyin S.
A search was carried out at work on the notice.
Winkler's body was found buried on the floor of his workplace.
His brother, Hussein S. (42), who was assessed to have helped Ali Kemal S. in the murder and made contradictory statements at the police station, was arrested.
The suspect, Ali Kemal S., had disappeared in Germany after Winkler's body was found.
Ali Kemal S., who was wanted by Interpol in 190 countries, was arrested walking down the street and did not resist the police.
The German Prosecutor General has not yet determined where the suspect is hiding, and the extradition process to Turkey could take up to four months.
It turned out that on the night of July 15, the FET<0xC3><0x96> coup d'étatists fired at the mosque to silence the saloon read from the mosque next to Akinci Base.
SABAH reached the statement made by the imam of the mosque during the complaint "in the name of the saints" with the images of the attack on the nearest mosque, TAI TUSA<0xC5><0x9E> Mosque.
According to the information received, the strikers began firing directly at the speaker from a distance of about 50 meters shortly after they began to read the sala in the mosque.
One of the bullets hit the side of the speaker and four toasted.
When the pulsers failed to hit the speaker, it was read to the end of the saloon given from the central system.
According to the crime scene minutes, the thugs who broke the door of the mosque with the intention of killing the imam walked inside with their boots.
Mosque Imam Mustafa <0xC5><0x9E>eker said: “I am not injured, I do not personally complain, but I want these criminals who can shoot even at the mosque and martyr the people of Kazan to be punished in the most severe way.”
Young People Killed by Drugs at Festival
Two out of five people who were hospitalized during the Youth Festival in Istanbul Sar<0xC4><0xB1>yer last week died.
According to the information received, 5 of the participants of a youth festival held in Bahçeköy on August 6 were sick and hospitalized.
Brigade Ergin (19) and Gökhan Alata<0xC5><0x9F> (19) were treated and died.
The treatment of three people is ongoing.
Police have arrested five suspects who allegedly sold drugs to young people attending the festival.
Three of the five suspects who were referred to the court after their actions in the police department were arrested, and two others were released without arrest.
Research into the cause of death of young people continues.
In the Burhaniye district of Bal<0xC4><0xB1>kesir, two of the six young people who camped on the beach and used drugs were ill.
B.D. and G.C., who were taken to the hospital, died.
The other four young people were taken to the police department to receive their testimony after their treatment.
A bomb explodes in front of his wife’s house
The 41-year-old M.Y., who lives in Bursa, detonated a hand-made grenade that his wife, who left the house about 8-9 months ago, made in front of her rented house with her own efforts and filled it with balls and nails, increasing the impact power.
While citizens experienced fear and panic due to the explosion last night, the ball and nail pieces in the assembly were scattered around, causing the windows of many houses to break.
Anti-terrorism teams began work to capture the M.Y., who fled after the incident and was said to be unemployed.
Neighborhood residents said the woman left the house about a month ago due to pressure from her husband and settled in a shelter.
Explosion in prison in Philippines kills 10 people
Senior inspector Xavier Solda, a spokesperson for the Penitentiary Administration and Penitentiary Bureau, said 10 Chinese prisoners had been killed in an unidentified explosion at the Paranaque Prison in Manila.
"Initial investigations have confirmed that there was an explosion inside," Left said, citing a guard who was seriously injured in the explosion.
"The investigation into the cause of the explosion is ongoing," he said.
Left said reports of prisoners wanting to meet with the jailer were being examined when they learned that they would be sent to another building before the incident, while inspectors were investigating whether the explosion was part of an escape attempt.
Police officer Jose Carumba told local media that the guard fired at the prisoners after hearing a gunshot, resulting in the detonation of a nearby grenade.
Curumba noted that authorities are investigating how the inmates who shot the guard put the gun into the prison.
Category: Explosions in Thailand
Three people were killed in explosions in four cities in southern Thailand.
Officials said three people were killed in the explosions in Trang, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket, and 35 others were injured, including tourists.
Police spokesman Piyapan Phingmuang said in a press conference that the bombings were not linked to terrorism.
"Thailand has no regional or religious problems with anyone," Phingmuang said.
"We think this is an act of internal sabotage," he said.
Junta leader Prayut <0xC3><0x87>an-oça told reporters he did not want to comment on who was behind the explosions.
"We must focus on ensuring peace, security and confidence," Oça said.
A bombing near the Erawan Temple in Rajprasong, Bangkok, on August 17, last year killed 20 people and injured 120.
"Sleeping Cruel" to be executed by poison injection
Lonnie David Franklin, 63, who has been arrested in the United States for at least 10 murders over the years, has been sentenced to death.
Franklin, a former cleaner, was targeting prostitutes and drug addicts in his murders.
Judge Kathleen Kennedy, who tried Franklin, said: “I have never seen such a monstrous and cruel criminal as you.”
Franklin is said to be one of the bloodiest killers in California's history.
Franklin, who was convicted of intentional killing of 10 people and attempted murder of one person, will be executed with a poison injection.
Prevention against FET<0xC3><0x96> in Macedonia
Macedonian State Minister Furkan <0xC3><0x87>ako said that FET<0xC3><0x96>'s extensions in their countries are taking steps to be legally identified and to start the necessary investigations.
Minister <0xC3><0x87>ako recalled that the organization has activities in Macedonia as well as in the media and business world, "All of this is known in the public eye."
The Turks here no longer give their children to FET<0xC3><0x96> schools.
We call on our people not to send their children here anymore.
"This building, which previously benefited from the hospitality and hospitality of the people, is well known by the public," he said.
The sky will be the scene of meteor showers.
Assoc. Prof. Dr. Hasan Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu, T<0xC3><0x9C>B<0xC4><0xB0>TAK National Observatory Researcher and Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences at <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul University, told AA reporter that Perseid will reach the highest level on the night of Friday, August 12th to Saturday, August 13th.
Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu said that thousands of parts were formed from the comet "Swift - tuttle" by the influence of the sun rays and gravity and the Perseid meteor shower, which will turn into a natural visual feast.
Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu stated that Perseid meteorite was first discovered in 1862 and has been seen again in the world since the 1990s.
Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu stated that Perseid meteor shower can be watched in July and August, "We should watch such a visual feast from space, we should be interested."
After all, it's a natural visual feast.
“It will help us get to know the universe better,” he said.
They'll shine red when it's cold, white when it's hot
As the sky was falling, some of the rocks fell to the earth in the size of lentils, and he said:
Perseid temperatures can reach up to 2,000 centigrades.
Due to warming and friction in the atmosphere, Perseids produce light in the natural environment, red when it is cold and white when it is warm.
Science can be contributed by writing how many meteors have been seen on the website of the International Asteroid Organization.
This data is of information value as it is collected from all over the world.
Can be watched all night
Recalling that the meteor shower is moving at about 60 kilometers per second, Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu said that this visual feast in the sky can be watched all night from places with little light in the northeast direction.
Eseno<0xC4><0x9F>lu reported that more than 100 meteor showers occur annually, and after the Perseid meteor shower, Geminid meteor shower was a natural event worth watching on December 4-17.
Less educated, former footballer Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an
If this balance is disturbed, it was the winning alliance between the populist Islamists led by the under-educated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an and Fetullah Gülen, a large-scale religious entrepreneur, and his highly-educated followers who founded more than a thousand schools, dozens of universities and educational institutes from Texas to Tashkent.
The above is a translation of a sentence from an article in Foreign Policy last week.
These and similar articles often appear in the Western press, where Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, a university graduate, is under-educated and former football player; Gulen, an elementary school graduate, is described as an entrepreneur whose horizon is wide, and Gulen’s followers are openly praised.
After that, on the other hand, in their articles "Why is anti-American and/or anti-Western in Turkey on the rise?" they try to explain with sentences that start with "Because Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an ...."
It is possible to imagine that the analysts who see the anti-Western situation in Turkey as a standout situation during Erdogan’s period are unaware of Turkey’s history.
In fact, according to statistics, the first decade of the Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an era could be read as a period in which anti-Western sentiment in Turkey decreased or remained average.
During this decade, good relations with the European Union and the United States were syncretized.
It's important to note that Erdogan's insistence on 'one-minute' to criticize Israel, that he should insist on 'one-minute', that he should insist on 'exclusively', that he should be able to 'explain to Turkey', that he should be able to 'explain to Turkey' and that he should be able to speak to Turkey and leave Turkey alone in the refugee crisis, that he should be in charge of 'excused to Turkey', that he should not be incumben on Turkey, that 'excused to Turkey', that he should be in 'excused to Turkey', that', that he should be in 'excused on Turkey, that, that, that he should be in the time', that some time, that he should be, that some time, that he should be in the European', that he should be, that he should be held, that he should be in the European Parliament, that he should be in the war, that he should be, that he should be, that he should be, that he should be, that he should be, that he should be, that he should be, that he should be, that he should be in the time, that he should be in the time, that he should be in the European Parliament, that he should not be, that he should be in the European Parliament, that he should not be in the time, Mr.
Let's say we have forgotten that while we lost 247 people as a result of the bloody coup, there was no support for our democracy from our so-called allies, the EU countries and the United States, until the coup proved to be a failure, that Kerry's first relevant speech was that they expected to build 'peace and stability in Turkey', and that there was no emphasis on democracy and the elected government.
But how can it be forgotten that despite the fact that 11 Charlie Hebdo employees were killed in Paris, many leaders from around the world, including Turkey, took part in the protests, but a month has passed since the coup attempt that killed 247 people who resisted the tanks for democracy, no president of any Western country who was an "allied" to Turkey?
What about the presidents who come several times a year or send high-level representatives to send lower-level representatives for the refugee issue?
How will we evaluate the fact that all EU and U.S. ambassadors are not visiting the bombed Turkish Grand National Assembly because the window of the Hürriyet newspaper was broken?
If it is remembered that in the first two weeks after the coup in Egypt, the EU sent high-ranking representatives to shake hands with the coup leader Sisi and praised the coup d'état by saying that Kerry's visit after the coup is "democracy is being rebuilt", is it very abnormal for Western countries who refuse to support Turkey in the resistance to democracy to express their concerns about Turkey's democracy at every opportunity?
Even allowing Gülen to live freely in the United States, which 95% of the population considers responsible for the coup, is enough to annoy the Turkish people right now.
If the background I mentioned above is added to this, I think it is clear that the rising anti-Western/American anti-Semitism is something that cannot be explained by Erdogan alone.
Moreover, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an has not even said that he still thinks that the US influence in the coup ...
The crate was never a tie.
Is it possible for the Gezi intelligent people who despise their own people, who say, "The Constituent Assembly is the law", who insult voters who don't think like themselves as "the ignorant who scratch their belly", to be able to play the same wire after the night of July 15?
After seeing how these people retained the state and democracy, did they look for an answer to the question, "Where did we go wrong?"
But are there so many questions that need to be answered?
The officers, who had served in various levels until yesterday and were given the right to use the weapons of the state, suddenly agreed to enter the status of "Traitor" and sought asylum from foreign states.
We need to see what kind of mental distortion we are living in, and how obsession with people leads people to behaviors that would be described as perversions.
When it comes to the attempted coup d'état of irrigated brains...
For those who participated in this action, was there a view other than comparing the cities of Turkey to the cities of Syria?
Why would an officer bomb the parliament of his country?
We should not have fallen into the error of expecting reasonable behavior from brains irrigated with the curses of FET<0xC3><0x96>.
Other responsibilities, but let’s face it, it’s not just the FET<0xC3><0x96> that is responsible for everything.
The cadres who present politics as a profession of fighting, hatred and hatred have also made the necessary contributions to the tragedies experienced.
Those who do not present themselves as “Light” have convinced the masses that all kinds of illegitimate behavior and even vulgarity are natural.
We have seen how those who hate their own people even open fire on these people when they are given weapons in their hands.
The way of democracy, the way we know
I say a very simple thing: on the evening of July 15th, the Turkish people gave 250 martyrs to the FET<0xC3><0x96> <0xC3><0x9C>çi Tufeyli, harami, Sergerdeh within the military, and built more democracy than liberation.
But there are three periods behind July 15, 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and beyond.
There are three changes that have been made in these three periods: economic, social, and political.
Social change has prepared two major phenomena: the migration from the countryside to the metropolis and the transfer of these migrants to the center after being held around the cities for a very long time.
I said on Wednesday that this move was via the subway.
I also emphasized that metro is the most important element of social change.
The second major change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The contribution of the road and bridge to modernization is easier to understand.
The way comes, the economic and social structure changes.
We have changed so much of our political structure.
I have identified this history with the bridges thrown over the Bosphorus in Istanbul since long ago.
Demirel built the Bosphorus Bridge.
This was the peak of the peasant movement after 1950 in the 1960s.
<0xC3><0x96>zal continued the progress in the same direction with the second bridge, which we now change its name to 15 July Martyrs Bridge.
Even their routes show the relationship between the environment and the center.
It is also a sign of what kind of social change is being pursued.
The purpose of Demirel and <0xC3><0x96>zal was to melt large masses in the center.
They embraced the ideology of the center.
For many years, the AK Party did not build the third bridge.
Because he was driving at full speed.
Incoming people were placed in satellite cities.
A somewhat closed system was created in those areas.
The local governments of the AK Party gave people food, work, social status, and they voted for the AK Party.
Thus, the masses were not asked to dissolve in the center, but to acquire their political consciousness in the environment, and then to come to the center as 'their own'.
This formation was related to the headscarf discussions that took place before the AK Party (1992-2002).
These discussions forced the masses to accept the necessity for conservative, conservative and provincial people to stand side by side, not to integrate with the center.
After 2002, the AK Party acted in the way I stated, politicizing the masses, adding them to politics, matured them.
Notice now that the construction of the Third Bridge coincides with the democratic struggle of July 15.
Thus, history and sociology are intertwined.
Let me add another dimension to this: the AK Party’s move, which I mentioned, is not limited to Istanbul bridges.
Something even more interesting is happening: the AK Party is now integrating the surrounding cities with the central cities.
This is done through two bridges.
The Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, <0xC3><0x87>anakkale 1915 Bridge.
Add paths to it.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Thrace from another route.
Do you know what this means, that Izmir will be a different city from now on?
Let’s say that the AK Party will take Izmir from the outside, which it can’t get from the inside.
Now Bursa, now <0xC3><0x87>anakkale, now Thrace cities will be transformed into other human and social geographies.
That's it!
The martyrs of July 15 are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie's sport in Fenerbahçe
Fenerbahçe continued the preparations for the Grasshoppers match with his training in the morning.
The training, which began at 10 a.m. under manager Vitor Pereira at Can Bartu Facilities, lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of core training in the hall, the players who went to the field did 5 to 2 ball catching and pass exercises with running and warming movements.
The training was completed with double goal matches in the narrow field.
Fenerbahçe will continue its preparations with training this evening.
The person who complained to the holy lightning smiled...
There are new developments related to Operation Shike against Fenerbahçe.
Reporter Hüseyin Gülerce, who participated in a program broadcast on CNN Turk and explained that this operation was carried out by FETO, said, "A name from the sports world has taught Fethullah Gülen his words about Aziz Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m himself."
“One day on the plane, lightning said to this person, ‘What are you doing next to Fethullah Gülen?’
When he heard this, he smiled and smiled at the Holy Spirit.
Why did the Holy Spirit come upon him?
If the president of the club, which is Turkey’s most supporter, is in this mindset, he thinks he can hurt himself.
"The Shike case was intended to liquidate Saint Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m," he said.
Following these words, a statement came from Faik I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k, one of the important lawyers of the Shike case.
I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k appeared in the Opposite View program published in Habertürk and revealed the person who complained to Fethullah Gülen, the FET<0xC3><0x96> leader of Aziz Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m.
Here are the words of Faik Light:
The Holy Prophet (saws) says something about the Holy Prophet (saws) and the Holy Prophet (saws).
On the way from Azerbaijan, on a private plane.
Mr. Aziz is a witty man, and when he criticizes someone, he also says it with subversive sentences.
Those suffocating sentences might bleed a little.
Some of these sentences may react.
These sentences are being raised somewhere.
Towels, hymnettes, such businessmen going there as if they were going to Hajj, Umre, it is not such a tolerable job.
What they say they do, they criticize very harshly.
That's not the only problem, of course.
In the meantime, try a football team.
The direct connections of some footballers and managers from Galatasaray Club and Hakan Kuzuk...
MR. HUNNICUTT: The subject matter is different.
Trabzonspor President Muharrem Usta extended his hand of friendship to Fenerbahçe.
"We are on the side of this country with 79 million people," he said, adding that the issue of Turkey is a matter of all clubs.
We need to take a firm stance.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with FET<0xC3><0x96>, if injustice has been done, then I will stand behind Fenerbahçe.
“But the issue between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is different,” he said.
Sacrifice Prices Revealed
Karabulut said: "As a unit, we have determined the price of the kilogram of the live sacrifice calf to be 18 liras."
“We determined the price of the camel as well as the live kilogram of 17 liras and the live kilogram of the cow which we call second class as 15 liras,” he said.
Karabulut, who pointed out that the animals that will not be victims in the last year were also put on sale, told about what citizens should pay attention when making sacrifices:
Particular attention should be paid to the earrings in animals.
It is also important that the animal is healthy.
For this, they can check the vaccines on the animal’s passport while our citizens are sacrificing.
In appearance, the victim must be alive and alive, and he must have thrown off his feathers.
You shouldn't have any saliva or snot on your face.
In recent years, we have also seen non-victim animals being sold and sold.
The animal must be 2 years old.
We can see this by looking at the animal’s teeth.
The teeth of a 2-year-old animal that we call a "cap" have emerged.
However, the younger animals do not have these teeth.
The animal may look big in appearance, but the lid teeth may not have come out.
It is also immediately noticeable because the cap teeth are already larger than the others.
Rize Airport to be made at sea
The second airport to be built with sea fill in Turkey will be Rize Airport.
Rize Airport will be built on 26 to 32 meters from the coast on an area of 266 hectares between the market district Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilköy Village and the Girl Tower.
Due to the high depth in Rize airport construction, about 3 times more filling material will be used than used at Ordu - Giresun Airport.
Within the scope of the project, the apron will be built with a track length of 3,000 meters and 45 meters wide where 36 aircraft can land and take off per hour.
Rize Airport, which will serve passenger and cargo aircraft in general, is also expected to serve the composition class D, turbulence class heavy, aircraft weighing more than 150,000 kilograms.
The Rize Airport project, which will be tendered by the General Directorate of Infrastructure Investments of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Communications of Transportation on September 8, will be carried out in the first place for sea fill, runway, apron, taxiway, perimeter road, safety wire mesh, mendirek, PAT sites and environmental lighting works.
These jobs will cost 600 million liras.
After the infrastructure works, 150 million liras will be spent on superstructure works covering the terminal buildings.
The construction of Rize Airport will be completed in 2 years and 9 months.
8 cents for the engine.
Fuel distribution companies have raised an average of 8 cents per liter of their engine, valid from midnight tonight.
According to the information received from the Oil Products Employers Union (PUIS), starting from August 13, 2016, the price of the engine will increase by an average of 8 cents per liter.
Accordingly, the price of its engine, which is an average of 3.68 liras per liter in Ankara, will increase to 3.76 liras.
The price of the engine will go from 3.63 liras to 3.71 liras in Istanbul and from 3.66 liras to 3.74 liras in Izmir.
Prices determined by distribution companies may vary slightly according to companies and cities due to competition and freedom.
Fuel distribution companies increased the price of their engine by four cents on Friday.
Here are the football players in Gulen’s conversation.
It turned out that Galatasaray and national footballers, who had once been stigmatized by Turkish football, were involved in the conversation of Fetullah Gülen, FET<0xC3><0x96> leader in 1996.
In the image that was taken in 1996, Hakan <0xC3><0x9C>nsal, Mert Korkmaz, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, <0xC4><0xB0>smail Demiriz, U<0xC4><0x9F>ur Tütuneker and Yusuf Tepekule are clearly visible among the footballers who listened to Fetullah Gülen's conversation.
In the conversation in question, Gülen, referring to Galatasaray, said, “We scored 4 goals and we won.”
Said Alpsoy, known as former football imam of FET<0xC3><0x96>, also told SABAH newspaper that "the premium was distributed to the team when Turkey became the third in the world in 2002."
Emre, Okan, Hakan <0xC5><0x9E>ukur, Hakan <0xC3><0x9C>nsal and Arif collected money from these premiums.
The money collected was $250,000 or $500,000.
He took this money to Pennsylvania.
“Laughter was later praised by Arif,” he explained.
The National Football Association has joined Smiley's campaign.
Emile Dereli said goodbye to Rio
In the 2016 Rio Olympics athletics division, Emel Dereli, who represented Turkey in the women's throws, did not qualify.
At the Olympic Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the women's bullet-shooting competition ended.
The last European third, Emel Dereli, scored about 17.01 meters in the first, about 16.86 meters in the second, and an invalid shot in the third attempt.
The national athlete, who placed 11th and 24th in the series, said goodbye to the Olympics, unable to stay in the final.
They became both actors and sports directors.
Galatasaray Daikin, one of the Volleyball Sultans League teams, extended the contract of captain Nihan Güneygil and signed with the athlete as both player and sporting manager.
In a statement from the yellow-red club, the 34-year-old was signed as both a player and a sporting manager and said, "We sincerely wish Captain Nihan Güneygil, who has a character as important as his career, as well as a successful volleyball career, success in his new mission."
Nihan, who lived his first first league experience with Bursaspor, then 75th year, Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>, Vak<0xC4><0xB1>fBank Güne<0xC5><0x9F> Sigorta and Fenerbahçe jerseys, respectively.

What a great story about Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, an official of the Amsterdam <0x26> Partners law firm that investigates legally the illegal activities of the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization (FET<0xC3><0x96>), wrote an article to the US magazine Forbes and shared information about how the FET<0xC3><0x96> was organized.
Amsterdam said Fetullah Gulen, the leader of the FET<0xC3><0x96>, was leading the organization from his mansion in Pennsylvania, adding that "it would be clear that the organization possesses a highly advanced organizational capability under the ground, if we take a close look at how Gülen operates about 150 charter schools in the United States."
Amsterdam said seven months ago it was commissioned by Turkey to investigate Gülen-connected companies and schools, stressing that what it has found so far is “shocking”.
Amsterdam, in its article, included the following views:
According to the informants, the Gülen organization has a strict hierarchy where instructions are communicated.
These instructions are usually communicated at face-to-face meetings with Gülen and Poconos.
There is a group of seven people on the hill (a group of suggestions).
This group passes the instructions to the advisory committee.
The instructions go from here to regional imams, country imams, regional imams within the country, provincial imams, regional imams within the provinces, neighborhood imams, student houses (light houses) and students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels according to their positions and support within the organization.
Amsterdam, which has the largest network of contract schools in the United States, said the organization has 55,000 jobs worldwide and millions of dollars in taxes paid by American taxpayers each year.
Amsterdam wrote that much of the money was directed among its members and transferred to "selected" subcontractors.
Amsterdam explained this process with the following examples:
California-based Magnolia schools were arrested after Gülen was fined $700,000 in annual service contracts to a company affiliated with and shared the same office.
Another example is the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam said the school paid the owner an additional $3.1 million, and audits found that the school and the management of the property company were made up of the same people linked to Gülen.
Noting that similar situations were found in the Harmony schools with 46 branches, which occupy the largest place in the Gülen network, Amsterdam said that smaller companies connected to FET<0xC3><0x96> were paid with items such as software licenses and curriculum purchases.
"These examples show that about $28 million of American taxpayers are being abused," said Amsterdam, underlining that the FET<0xC3><0x96> was made to enrich each other.
"And that's what we've found so far," he said.
Pointing out that nothing has been done to prevent such incidents so far, Amsterdam recalled that the situation has worsened in the past period and that the Texas Department of Education has begun to investigate irregularities on all these issues.
Amsterdam emphasized that schools seem to function normally, with many employees not knowing what kind of corruption is.
"But in fact, these schools work like a snow machine for Gülen," Amsterdam said.
"Laughter then uses huge amounts of money for political donations to hide its illegal activities," he said.
According to a former American teacher who worked at these schools, some employees at Gülen schools held separate meetings and transferred a portion of their salaries to the organization, Amsterdam said, "Gulen members in the Turkish Armed Forces are believed to be working in a similar way."
Coup-provocators have been strengthening their positions over the years.
“However, while the army was apparently functioning normally, a parallel force was gathering power behind the scenes,” he wrote.
Amsterdam concludes its article as follows:
U.S. policymakers have questions about the events of July 15-16 and beyond, and this is expected.
But as the two allies deal with their situation at the diplomatic level, individual statesmen need to awaken to the fact that U.S. law has been seriously violated in Gülen’s operations.

And the prophet Zechariah said to him,
Asked about the alleged capture of Zakaria <0xC3><0x96>z and Ad<0xC4><0xB1>l <0xC3><0x96>k<0xC3><0x96>z<0xC4><0xB1>z in Georgia, <0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu said, “This information is not true at the moment.”
But there are different reports.
All of this is being evaluated.
We are in close contact with the Georgian authorities.
"Every detail, information, information is meticulously evaluated," he said.
<0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu asked if there was any doubt that they might be in Georgia. "Zekaria <0xC3><0x96>z had fled to Georgia before."
It was detected on cameras at the customs gate.
He knows he's been to Europe.
We study and track every information that comes to us, not only for these two, but also for the other fugitives.
Wherever they run, we will follow them,” he said.
Asked about his meeting with Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif, <0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu said, "Two issues were considered."
There are many issues between Turkey and Iran.
Political, commercial, transport, energy, counterterrorism is our common struggle.
There are also regional issues.
Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and the Gulf Region.
Turkey and Iran can play an important role in solving the problems in the geography we live in.
We agree on a lot of things.
We agree on many issues such as Syria’s territorial integrity, border integrity, and the clearing of ISIS and other terrorist organizations in Syria, as well as the existence of an inclusive government.
We had different ideas about Assad.
But we're gonna keep talking about it like we always do.
We agree on the ceasefire, the continuation of Geneva negotiations.
A consensus on a lot of things doesn't make sense unless it's essentially a conclusion.
He said, “The important thing is to get results.”
<0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu asked when Turkish aircraft would participate in operations in Syria, "Our delegation went to Moscow on this issue."
“The purpose of establishing these mechanisms is to determine what steps should be taken here, especially in the fight against Daesh, and to ensure that any incidents are taken in a coordinated manner so as not to cause an accident,” he said.
<0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu said, “Iran and Turkey are two brother countries.”
The arbitrations should not decide, we can make an agreement between ourselves on this matter.
I also had a bit of a headache.
We should make these deals before we go to arbitration.
“We had demands on gas reduction, prices,” he said.
<0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu asked about Gülen's return to the United States on the date of his departure, "A delegation from the United States will arrive on the 22nd."
Meetings will be held on August 23-24.
Our Justice Department is preparing the case.

Two injured children were transported to the Kahta State Hospital by ambulance.
Hussein O., one of the wounded, is fighting for his life in intensive care.
He carried the kids he hit in the trunk so they wouldn't get dirty.
Mustafa O. narrated the accident, “We were going to visit with friends.”
We got our stuff.
We were hit by a car near the transformer near the Karadut village Uzeyir Prophet’s visit.
My leg was broken by the impact.
The driver first took my friend and threw him in the trunk.
Then he took me and put me in the trunk of the car next to my friend.
When I put it in the trunk, my hand was stuck between the trunk door.
So I yelled.
The chauffeur who heard my voice threw the trunk door again.
I'll fix my hand.
The baggage door closed again and took us to the village of Narince.
“They took us to the hospital with the ambulances,” he said.

Mustafa O., the grandfather of the wounded child. "I was at the Kahta when the accident happened."

They brought my niece first.
Fifteen minutes later, they brought my granddaughter.
Gerger Police Station Commander has arrived.
He asked if you were a complainer.
I have accidents everywhere.
I said I'm not complaining.
Then I went and looked at the car that hit my niece and granddaughter.
There's a lot of blood in the trunk.
Then we found out that after he hit the kids, he put the two injured people in the trunk of the car and brought them to the hospital.
He's putting my nephew in the trunk with my granddaughter downstairs.
And they say I didn't put it in the trunk.
The back seat of the car is clean.
He said, "That can't be happening."
One of the villagers, Mehmet Kaya, said, "The driver who hit the children brought the wounded here."
The children, the wounded, were pulled out of the trunk of the car.
“Even the animal did what should not be done,” he said.
The victim’s uncle, Osman O., said, “What kind of person is the citizen who shot these children?”
It could be an accident, a person could die in an accident.
But it's brutal to pick up the wounded and drive them to the hospital in the trunk of the car.
We're his followers to the end of it.
One of these kids is clawed to death.
The other is in severe condition.
He's bringing in the wounded in the trunk of the car from Narince to Kahta.
Goddamn it.
Don't let such a brutal incident happen again.
Our lungs are burning.
We're gonna be plaintiffs, and we're not gonna let this go.

Around the island are palm trees, mangroves, fruit trees, other edible plants, herbs.
The island, which is connected to the coast with a 30-meter cord, generates its own electricity, water and internet with the help of this cord.
"I'm a vegetarian and I grow a lot of edible vegetables on the island," Sowa said.
I have to go to a nearby grocery store to get more food.
“There’s also an eight-person release I made from plastic bottles,” he said.

Thankfully, despite the searches, they were not found.
The police took action when it was reported that Selmet <0xC5><0x9E>ükür was in Friday prayers at Salko Mosque on Adapazar<0xC4><0xB1> Sakarya Street.
They were waiting for the Friday prayer to be performed.
After the prayer was over, Selma raised her hands when she saw the policemen.
Selmet <0xC5><0x9E>ükür, who had been ordered to be arrested, was taken to the police car and taken to the Police Department.
Gökhan <0xC5><0x9E>ükür followed the team vehicle with which his father was taken and went to the Security Directorate.

Escaped Police Chief Arrested in Zaho
Ahmet Duran Bitmez, the 3rd-grade Police Director of Batman Provincial Police Department, was suspended as part of an investigation into the FET<0xC3><0x96> coup attempt.
It is also determined that the arrest warrant was issued by the Endmez fugitive.
According to a study conducted by the Provincial Police Department teams, it was determined that Bitmez had fled to Zaho, Iraq.
He was caught in a joint operation carried out by the security forces of the two countries.
He was brought to Turkey and taken into custody in Batman.
After the trial, the defendant was brought to the court.
Security forces are suspected of Bitmez fleeing north of Iraq to join terrorist group PKK camps.
Watch out for these children’s habits.
Dentistry Faculty Assoc. Dr. Bilgin Giray said that children relax with this reflex by making sucking a requirement since they cannot chew at an early age.
Assoc. Dr. Giray, who listed the reasons for the appearance of finger sucking habits in children, said, "Finger sucking is an event that occurs from birth to 3-4 years of age."
Most babies suck their thumbs.
The child who sucks his finger to satisfy the need for sucking in his infancy after the age of 1-1.5 years sucks his finger to relieve the yearning for the breast and relaxation.
He said, “When he gets bored and distracted, when he’s asleep, when he’s nervous, and when he leaves the mother, he’s able to suck his finger.”
Assoc. Dr. Bilgin Giray, who emphasized the inadequacy of mother-child relationship and lack of confidence in the child at an advanced age, described the effects of this behavior on dental health in the following words:
The behavior of finger suction has a negative effect on the formation of the child’s tooth structure.
As a result of the pressures generated during the suction, the upper teeth are pushed forward and the lower teeth are pushed back.
This leads to the positioning of the lower jaw behind, disturbing the balance of the palate and dental structure.
The physiological reflection of this is that speech impairment and its closure appear to be aesthetically bad.
Assoc. Dr. Giray pointed out that a much more complex treatment process can be experienced at the age of 6-7 years when permanent teeth begin to emerge if there is no early solution. "We can protect our children from closing and joint problems before the development of the jaw is completed."
"That's why today's children need to keep their mouth structure under control, like eye and hearing controls," he said.
New pale in the treatment of near vision: Trifocal Lenses
After cataract treatment, patients do not naturally want to wear glasses.
Multi-focused lenses have been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients.
With the trifocal lenses that have been used recently, the success of the treatment in this area has taken a step further.
Trifocal lenses differ from other lenses in the ability to provide clear vision not only at distances defined as distances, but also at distances defined as distances.
Treatment of remote, close or intermittent visual impairments
In visual impairments, the distance represents a point that we use very often in our daily lives.
For example, the dashboard of cars, the portable computers we hold in our lap, or the distance we define as 60-70 cm arm length are the distances.
Thanks to the trifocal lenses adjusting the distances, our patients do not need to wear glasses in any way, whether near or far.
Another advantage of trifocal lenses is that it reduces nighttime complaints.
Ophthalmology Specialist Assoc. Dr. Volkan Hürmeric "The trifocal lens treatment applied for each distance vision treatment is no different from the normal cataract treatment."
Our patients with trifocal treatment are able to regain eye health with a procedure of 7 to 10 minutes.
And the next day, our patients can return to their normal lives.
It is an operation that improves the quality of life, especially for people who drive, use computers, love to read and live a more active life.
You can also contact an ophthalmologist to find out if this procedure is suitable for you, which can be applied to every patient who has reached the age of 18.
Varicose veins are not used in cardiac surgery!
Varicose veins are a fairly frequent disease in recent years.
The heir, whose genetic proximity is the primary factor; long working hours, long standing jobs, and long sitting causes an increase in varicose veins complaints.
Are veins used in heart surgery?
I have an heir, what to do if I have a heart attack in the future? questions are also often asked by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
There are two types of vascular systems in the leg:
1.The leg has a deep vein system called the main pathway that carries dirty blood to the lungs and collects the main dirty blood of the leg.
They are called the deep femoral vein and the superficial femoral vein.
Problems in these veins are more rare, in their diseases the vein cannot be closed, and drug treatments are applied to keep these veins open.
There is a superficial vein system in the leg that carries dirty blood to the lungs and joins with the deep vein system in the groin.
This system consists of two large and two small safen veins called veins.
In all four of these vessels, insufficiency and varicose veins can develop.
The veins that can be used in heart surgery are superficial veins called large safen veins.
The absence of these veins is not harmful to the body and therefore can be used in heart surgery.
However, in order for these veins to be used in heart surgery, the veins must be healthy.
The heart is a very important organ.
The process of surgical removal of varicose veins or burning them with a laser in place reduces the workload of the deep veins and makes the leg healthier.
A misconception among the people is that varicose veins can be used as a substitute.
Varicose veins are never and never used in heart surgery!
There are other veins that can be used in heart surgery.
Replacement vascular systems that can be used in heart surgery are located under the chest cage, around the stomach and in the arm.
Therefore, it is unnecessary to wait for the varicose vein to be used for the heart and worry about it.

Significant message from Uzbek before Super Cup
Dursun <0xC3><0x96>zbek, President of Galatasaray Sports Club, issued a statement ahead of the Super Cup Final between Galatasaray and Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>.
Here are the words that Dursun Uzbek drew attention to unity and unity in Turkish football:
Galatasaray, a two-rooted and two-favorite club of Turkish sports, will face Besiktas for the Super Cup at Konya Metropolitan Torku Arena on Saturday evening, August 13.
This is neither the first nor the last match of our two prestigious clubs in a century of competition.
But it's a very vital encounter in terms of timing.
As we all know, the night of July 15th, our country went through a great loss.
The coup attempt of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization/Parallel State Building (FET<0xC3><0x96>/PDY) which is aiming at our democracy has been overcome by the unity and solidarity of all sectors of society.
That night We paid a heavy price as a people.
We gave martyrs.
We have a lot of gas.
This painful price reminds us once again of the virtue of democracy, the necessity and importance of peace in this land, not of fighting.
That night, representatives of the Turkish sport also protested the coup with one voice and one heart; they all stood by democracy.
In these critical times, we need the unifying feature of the sport more than ever.
I wish that this match, which coincides with the 2nd anniversary of the death of our dear rival President Süleyman Seba and just before the new football season named after the legendary captain of our club, Turgay <0xC5><0x9E>eren, will be the starting match of love and peace in Turkish sport.
I hope that the winner will be our country and the Turkish sport, regardless of the score at the end of the match, which will be shared by Galatasaray and Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> fans in front of the tribunes.

Scot Callum Skinner flies home while Britain shuts down
While the Great Britain Trio retained their title from London in 2012, Scottish Callum Skinner won the men's race on the Rio racetrack last night.
The 23-year-old racer from Glasgow took on the pioneering role adopted by Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and this young man made the legend proud as he returned home triumphantly in his acclaimed New Zealand outfit.
At the event four years ago, where Hoy took five of his six Olympic golds, Britain had a shocking victory.
And despite Hoy's retirement, they reiterated this by finishing sixth at the Race World Championships in London in March.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert starting player Jamie Staff.
They did it right when Hindes showed up.
Today's retirement also created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
He had seen the potential Scot had already realized, and the British coach had not given up on Skinner.
Four years ago, Hindes, Kenny and Skinner, who were champions with Hoy, broke the Olympic record in the qualifying round, but New Zealand set it again in the first round.
And the British trio fought for gold.
Although Hindes was a little behind in his own lap, Kenny brought the team forward, and Skinner stood by it.
A big part of the transformation that allowed Hindes to keep pace with Kenny, and especially Skinner, using a larger tool that would slow him down was the change in strategy.
Today, as the BBC's expert commentator, watched them from their place, and when they climbed on the podium, Skinner caught the eye of Kenny and Hindes.
"This is an honorable comparison," said 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow.
I'm just here to do my best and make my name known.
In the final, we broke the Olympic record and beat the world champions.
That was really incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a bad start after a victory with Kenny and Hoy in London 2012.
He later reacted to this interpretation, and there was no way to demand from Britain's rivals.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
“With all the flags of Great Britain on the stand, it was like we were in London,” Hindes said.
We're a team that was formed just three months ago.
“We’ve lost so many world races, so it’s really incredible to have won the Olympics again.
This is just an event, a medal, for a nation that has won seven of the 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of the progress we have made over the last five months, we have five more days to pass successfully on the racetrack.
Kenny's attitude shows that today's dream of winning three gold medals in a single Olympic is not impossible.
This would mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and was born on March 23 (which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, a British sports past sacred date), would receive six gold medals and one silver medal.
That's the same level as Hoy.
From now on, Kenny will be in the sprint race; the race will start today and last for three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton said: “I’m just enjoying it for now.
Team activities are always the best activities.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, you feel lonely.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be given a knight's title."
While this is just the event of today’s medal, there is a lot of good news for Britain.
Ser Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-man, four-kilometer team race.
They finished the runway in 3:51,943 minutes.
The gold medalist in London 2012 set the world record at 3:51,659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be determined in today’s second part, and Wiggins will certainly draw all the attention.
Yesterday, prior to the qualifying round, he had a disagreement with officials while the authorities were calling him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie have reached the world record for 4:13,260 years.
The Great Britain Team relies on a strong cycling team to handle the reins in the middle of the Olympic Games and win many medals.
Following the great dominance in Beijing and London, expectations in Rio have been greatly reduced.
In the background, there have been many bad developments, including manager Shane Sutton’s resignation in April due to charges of sexism and bullying, and the retirement of key figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But on the first night after the races on the track, it shows that Britain's epic reputation for finishing in perfect time can be proven again this time.
The future of Portland powerhouse is questionable with the cancellation of the energy contract
The future of the Portland aluminum heat furnace in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers fell into uncertainty after one of the plant owners announced the termination of a supply contract, which would lead to the cancellation of all supply contracts by the energy company providing energy to the facility.
This move came after the Victorian government’s decision earlier this year to not exceed subsidies to keep the facility running.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland facility could be at risk.
Any closure can cause up to 2,000 jobs to be at risk, directly or indirectly.
And since the lizard furnace consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity, additional chain effects can also occur.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry shut down the power plant, which led to the shutdown of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s Portland resort is losing money and is at risk of shutting down.
These developments initially emerged after several years of speculation about the strengthening of the Australian dollar and the future of the facility based on the facility’s consumption fee.
AGL, which supplies energy from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley to the large aluminum boiler, said it expects the other three owners to take action to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the facility is owned by Alcoa and Alumina joint ventures, with CITIC in China and Marubeni Corp in Japan holding smaller shares.
“AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, which means the demand for physical electricity for the ignition furnace will continue,” he said.
AGL stated that the contracts are "risk-balance contracts" that must enter into force from November 2016.
Since the contracts have a 12-month termination period, they will be completed in 2017.
“For this reason, AGL will continue to expect contracts to contribute to the 2017 fiscal year as well,” the energy company said.
The impact that AGL may have on potential earnings in the fiscal year 2018 and beyond is currently limited to adopting a strong futures contract stance for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said the value of their contracts in their accounts had already fallen to $187 million due to the "feshin expectation".
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the quarry or supply electricity to the quarry."
The U.S. company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, which was supposed to enter into force in November this year, but has not yet announced why it has not withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are both alert to the possibility of closing the Portland grenade in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to economic woes in the industry.
Stephen Mikkels, AGL’s operations chief, who responded to analysts earlier this week, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts of energy each year.
If both of these facilities are withdrawn from the market, it will cause a significant decline in demand in the [electric] market.
And as a manufacturer, this is not a good development for us.”
Not only is she the star of the Kardashian TV show; Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
Model and executive mother Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, Kendall Jenner (20), is on the cover of U.S. Vogue's highly anticipated September issue.
Kendall, a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who appeared in Milan, Paris and New York Fashion Weeks, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
Kendall wrote, “I cried when I looked at this cover in a room full of people I loved.”
Following the release of the cover, a strange (or simply unique to Keeping Up with the Kardashians) scripted reality video was released in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the bar’s troublemaker Rob and Caitlyn and everyone’s favorite show-world uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) was featured; in the video, the family who forgot their sisters’ cover was actually making a final classic.
While this is the cliché storyline of almost every "birthday" episode of all children's television shows (Seacrest says with a cartoon rabbit sincerity at 8 a.m. "Did you think we forgot about you?") Kris should have somehow included the other girls in this promotion.
With this development in Vogue’s September issue, we are certainly entering a new Kardashian era.
Kendall's older sister, Kim, may have surpassed her in appearing on the Vogue cover (she shared the cover with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover itself is a success.
Vogue's September issue was the best-selling number of the year.
With its thickness that resembles a coffee table book rather than a fashion magazine, this issue has attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista found that 615 of last year’s 832-page volume contained advertising content).
The announcement of the cover star is also a closely watched process; over the past two years, the magazine’s pictures have been leaked before the official announcement.
Among the women previously featured on the cover are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has given more "celebrities who model" than "famous models."
Oscar-winning Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the cover in 2013, and the following year the honor was bestowed on Lady Gaga.
But even if Ms. Jenner, described by the magazine as the "glowing model" of her generation, was included in the previous category, her surroundings could be said to be quite good.
These celebrities are not relatives of celebrities or reality show stars or today’s youth who know how to make good Snapchat videos (although Jenner is all of them).
These are all women whose talent is legitimate, who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, had one of the best moments of her career with Lemonade’s debut.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Due to the history of the reality show, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the sluts of time".
When news broke that Jenner was going to be on the cover of Vogue, the idea came to light again.
But focusing on dissatisfaction seems inappropriate.

She's literally a supermodel.
She's going to Marc Jacobs' show.
It's Estée Lauder buying you a fondue.
He, along with his sisters, is selling you his own paintings in related payment-walled apps.
He's selling Cindy Crawford's daughter's photos to LOVE magazine.
And in his free time, he appears on reality TV only to see his brother Kourtney and his children.
Social legal support centers turn down 160,000 people every year
As the sector prepares for the impact of further funding cuts on already strained operations, more than 160,000 people from the nation's most vulnerable are being turned away from social legal support centers.
In Queensland, three out of five people (mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, and the like) are turned down while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services that have exhausted their possibilities are preparing for further cuts.
By June next year, these legal support centers will be deprived of more than 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Centers for Social Legal Support, reported in the latest Census Report of the National Association of Social Legal Support Centers that thousands of people are being turned down every year.
Mr. Farrell said the situation would be much worse if the federal government's decision was not reversed.
"Queensland's social legal support centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are unable to access the vital services they need," he said.
People in violent relationships, families in the process of secession, and workers who have been unfairly laid off... All of these face legal issues and, according to this report, do not get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means thousands of unprotected Queensland residents are forced to deal with more complex legal issues without help.
We call on Secretary of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately withdraw these funding cuts so that people can get the support they need when facing a legal challenge.
Last year, the government fulfilled its promise to raise legal support funding to the national average.
Now we have to look at social legal support centers and the communities they serve and the investment the Palaszczuk government will make in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team sued after staff allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign team has been sued for allegedly not taking any action after the North Carolina operations director was told he had pulled a gun on a staffer while traveling in a jeep in February.
The case was announced Wednesday in a lawsuit filed in the state court by former software trainer Vincent Bordini of the state campaign team.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally, but later realized that "this will not happen".
As Bordini pointed out in his complaint, the Director, Earl Philip, "put out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and held the barrel toward Vincent's kneecap".
According to the complaint, Bordini learned that at least four others had the same experience as Phillip after complaining to their local and regional campaign team leaders.
Bordini said in a complaint that "weapons don't need to be fired to cause damage."
The case was opened two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused outrage to the crowd in North Carolina, saying that "people of the Second Constitution Amendment" (which appears to be gun owners and gun supporters) could take action if her rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and elected her own judges.
Trump’s campaign team said the media evaluated those words outside the context and that he did not support violence.
Bordini, with his complaint, requests compensation from the campaign team for surveillance negligence and Phillip for assault, beatings and spiritual damage.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not respond quickly to the message asking her to comment.
Trying to reach Phillip was unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news subsidiary in Charlotte, reported that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, did not receive a quick response.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.

Inspired by Bodrum, they made 'Sample Village' in Sivas
Cankoy, Governorship and charitable businessman of the Golova District of SIVAS were formed as an 'exemplary village' in cooperation.
In the village, where the roads were paved and paved on the sidewalks, all the houses were painted in blue and white colors, as an example of Mu<0xC4><0x9F>la's Bodrum district.
Golova Governorate prepared an exemplary village project to improve the image and quality of life of the villages connected to the district.
In this context, 66-digit Cankoy was chosen as the sample village 12 kilometers away from the district center.
Infrastructure and superstructure services were increased, the roads of the village were paved and the sidewalks covered with parquet stones.
Village houses with different shades of color were painted with the support of Selahattin Ayan, a businessman who owned Pelit Pastry.
The whole village looked like buildings painted in white and blue.
BODRUM EXAMPLE
Gölova Mayor Erkan Isa Erat, who gave information about the study, said that they were preparing this project to sign a study that would be a role model for other villages, "It was part of our project that the village looked more modern and all the houses were one color."
When we started this project, we were looking for an example.
When we went to Bodrum, the pictures of the houses with white painted and blue windows caught our attention.
We wanted to take Bodrum as an example because of the cleanliness of the white and its positive effect on people.
By doing our work, we painted all the houses in Cankoy in white and blue colors.
This work was done with state and charitable cooperation.
The project cost about 200,000 liras.
With the study, our Cankoy in Sivas became like a small basement.
We want to continue this kind of work with our budget and with the support of our businessmen.
Cankoy Mukhtar Abdullah Majit, 66, said that with the support of the Governorate, the village has received a whole new image.
Majid said that being an exemplary village pleased them and the people of the village, and thanked everyone who worked.

The audit of the disputed asset fund is again in the commission
Turkey's Asset Fund, which is expected to become one of the world's largest funds, has been silently removed from the law over objections.
Due to lack of control mechanisms, it was decided to renegotiate the fund, but it was again discussed at the commission without any changes.
Utku <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>ro<0xC5><0x9F>er, CHP MP and Member of the Planning and Budget Commission, who evaluated the Turkish Assets Fund law proposal brought by AKP to sozcu.com.tr, said, "This structure will consist of public assets, workers, mandatory pension cuts to be taken from employees, unemployment funds collected for the unemployed, we are strictly against exclusion from the constitutional audit mechanisms."
The Turkish Wealth Fund bill, prepared by the government to provide long-term resources for investments and projects, was removed from the law on Tuesday with the opposition's view that it should also be discussed.
However, the AKP today re-opened the proposal to the Plan and Budget Commission in the same way.
Utku <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>rözer, a CHP member of the Turkish Parliamentary Plan and Budget Commission, told SOZCU.com.tr about the concerns and concerns of the CHP regarding the Assets Fund law proposal.
"When the establishment of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission within the draft of the bag law, our former Finance Minister Zekeriya Limel, who was the head of the CHP delegation, expressed our concerns and concerns and proposed that this bag be removed from the law and also discussed in detail," <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>rozer said.
The government, which accepted this view, also withdrew the bill.
The bill came to the committee again yesterday.
"The government seems to insist that this should be removed from Parliament within a week," he said.
"Our biggest concern in this bill is irregularities," said <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>roözer, who said that there should be an agreement on the issue of the Assets Fund law.
"The assets belonging to the public, the labourer's compulsory pension cuts to be taken from the employees, the incomes from the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, the incomes from privatization are unregulatedly transferred to a structure that is outside the control of the Parliament and the Court of Accounts and has no responsibility," he said.
Russia, China and the Gulf countries, where such funds are established, have excess oil revenues and trade, and the funds are funded in this way, <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>roözer said, “But we have a savings gap.”
So the fund will consist of public resources, the money of the people.
A total of 100 billion in the unemployment fund, 100 billion from the forced individual pension fund to the employees, and 50 billion without privatization are planned.
“So this fund, which will be entirely made up of public money, must be under public control and this money should not be spent irresponsibly,” he said.
Emphasizing that it is unacceptable to exclude a fund from the control of the Assembly, in which state resources are collected and state assets are shown as collateral in borrowing, <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>rozer expressed his concerns and concerns about the Asset Fund law proposal as follows:
Businesses and transactions relating to the collection, expenditure and borrowing of such a large public asset cannot be avoided only under the supervision of independent auditing companies.
There must also be a public inspection and a transparent structure.
In the bill, there are no provisions on the Wealth Fund's supervision and transparency by constitutional institutions.
There is no limit to how much resources will be transferred.
No one is going to ask how this money is used.
The purpose of the fund is to justify the financing of large projects.
There is no need to set up an unsupervised fund outside of the budget for this.
Why not put it into the budget?
And then, naturally, the question arises: “Why are Sa<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F>ta<0xC5><0x9F> and the Assembly avoiding control?”
Noting that they are not opposed to the transfer of the money accumulated in the Asset Fund to investments, but they are opposed to the fact that it is being done by non-transparent, accountable mechanisms, he continued: "It is possible to discuss whether such a fund is needed."
But if the Government insists on this, then we must ensure that the international standards applicable to other countries where such investment funds are established are also applicable in Turkey.
It must be structured in a way where the mechanism of control and responsibility is introduced.
It must be established in such a way that there will be no doubts on it, and the citizen will be held accountable for his own money used until the last penny.
"We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticisms in Parliament, especially after the July 15 coup attempt."
In this bill, we hope that the AKP will listen to our constructive criticisms.
We oppose the unruly use of national assets, the transfer of them, the irresponsibility of those who use them, and the lack of public control.
“The Fund for Desired Assets can only be useful if these concerns are addressed,” he said.
It was learned that efforts have been made to achieve a consensus between the AKP and the opposition on the proposed law.
“The trust we have in Turkey is an indicator of our investments.”
Speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, Ali Koç, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Automotive, said: "The investment of TL 30 billion we have made in the last 5 years is an indication of our confidence in the future of our country."
Koç Holding Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors and Ford Automotive Chairman of the Board of Directors Ali Koç and the director of many foreign-capital firms met at the meeting on "Trust in Turkey, Producers in Turkey" organized by Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
Speaking at the meeting, Ali Koç said, “With our partners, we are not only saying our faith and trust in our country, but we are filling it with our investments and actions.”
The investment of 30 billion TL we have made in the last 5 years is an indication of our confidence in the future of our country.
Turkey needs to attract more foreign investment; a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy of international standards, a qualified workforce and an ecosystem that promotes R<0x26>D, innovation, entrepreneurship and added value.
Over the past few years, our government has offered our industrialists the most comprehensive incentives in the history of the Republic.
"I believe that with these incentives and holistic strategies, we will be able to launch a new 'Investment Move' that we need," he said.
Hüseyin Gelis, Chairman and CEO of Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey, said: “No more events are not just a problem of one country, we know this as global players.”
We came to Turkey with a long-term look.
If we are united and united, our problems will surely be solved.
We were able to bring what was not possible in Turkey 160 years ago to this land.
We will continue to be present in these areas in Turkey.
“Of course, we will build factories, but we need to have clear horizons in this area,” he said.
Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for them, Shell Turkey President Ahmet Erdem said, "Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for Shell."
We sincerely believe in Turkey’s potential and future.
We have invested in many areas, especially energy, and we continue to do so.
We would like to thank our President, Prime Minister and Ministers for their efforts to support international investors.
Reliable work is being done for international investors.
“This is the way to increase the competitiveness of our country,” he said.
Dr. Altan Demirdere, Sandoz/Novartis President of Turkey and the Middle East Region, said: "Our Global CEO would come to Turkey on August 10."
The trip was postponed.
That's what we objected to.
Because the CEO's arrival was very important.
They made requests for a bulletproof car, protection.
When he got here, everything was normal.
He left the guards and the car and returned to his country happily.
Investing in a country is like marriage.
First of all, if everything goes well, you get engaged and get married with a long-term plan.
We are also married to Turkey and have no intention of divorce.
He's back from the brink!
Prime Minister Binali Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m spoke to business people by teleconference at the consultation meeting held by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry on "Trust in Turkey, Producers in Turkey" held in Swiss Hotel.
Prime Minister Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m stated that the sector that will provide Turkey's comparative superiority is the industrial sector, "We should not miss the transition process to Industry 4.0 in the industry as well."
“If we are the locomotive of our country and we care about achieving the 2023 targets, we need to think about the industrial revolution along with the IT and technology revolution and achieve it,” he said.
On the night of July 15, Turkey was on the brink of a great abyss, Prime Minister Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m added, "Those who want the future of our country, those who are trying to destroy its democracy, those bastards who are not afraid to bomb our Gazi Assembly, if they were successful, we were talking about another Turkey today."
We were going to talk about a Turkey between the third world countries, which had been taken over by the coup, the national will had been abolished and the world had fallen from the league of developing countries.
"Thank God, we have overcome this problem with the strength of our nation, our Commander-in-Chief, our President, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the determination of our government," he said.
The Prime Minister said: “We will quickly get out of the impact of this incident and look ahead.”
It’s never and never right to live with a constant blow.
We have very ambitious goals ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake the Turkish economy.
Those who were waiting for chaos and crisis were once again wrong.
Today, our democracy and our economy are healthy.
Our banking sector, our financial sector, continues to function in a healthy way.
In 2015, the foreign trade deficit appears to have fallen by 25 percent.
The rate of current deficit to national income was 5.8 percent in 2014, which fell to 4.5 percent in 2015.
We are aiming for 4 at the end of this year.
We'll never change our stance on public finances.
Turkey’s 2016 budget also exceeded the national income of 130 countries.
We have reduced the rate of the budget deficit above 11% to 1.3% in 2015, and we are trying to maintain those rates.
We are better in public debt than the EU, than many countries in the world.
Our banking finance sector continues to operate on a solid basis.
"Our Central Bank did not need to give foreign currency to the market despite July 15, and there is no reduction in our reserves, we have a gross reserve of over $121 billion," he said.
Prime Minister Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m said that they will provide all kinds of ease for the development of the economy, increase of production and the creation of new employment areas, "We are also making comprehensive arrangements for you to recover from your burdens on the past."
We have implemented and continue to implement a number of regulations, until we get from the stock forgiveness to the excess of the cash and the re-investment of the unpaid tax debts with an ease.
“You continue to produce for the country, continue to rely on your country, and your government will continue to lift the barriers before you one by one.”

Turkey does not break away from the West, does not give up the European Union
Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek: Turkey does not break away from the West and does not give up the European Union
Deputy PM Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek, Minister of Science Industry and Technology Faruk <0xC3><0x96>zlu, Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci attended the meeting on "Trust in Turkey, Producers in Turkey" organized by Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
Speaking at the meeting, Minister of Science and Industry Faruk <0xC3><0x96>zlü said, "I think there have been many positive results from the developments that took place on and after the night of July 15."
The most important of these is, without a doubt, the spirit of unity and unity that the whole of Turkey feels deeply at the moment.
The July 15 process showed how strong Turkey’s economy has dynamics and how society has internalized democracy.
"It is clear that for a society that has achieved this level in the economy and in democracy and in democracy, the next process will go better, easier and faster," he said.
“Turkey needs to be saved from this scourge.”
Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci, who said that it was difficult to tell the world about the 15 July coup attempt from Faruk <0xC3><0x96>zlu, said that the government has declared mobilization in this regard.
Zeybekci also referred to the interest rate cuts launched by banks recently, "If 63.4% of the profits of the first five hundred of my real sector go to interest, we should give up all our work and concentrate on this business."
The President is coming back and saying this.
With the real sector, the banking system, the government, the politics, the unity and unity shown by politics after the Turkish civil democracy revolution on July 15th, Turkey must get rid of this trouble.
We welcome the recent developments in this regard.
"I hope that in the coming period, we will realize its sustainability and continuity by supporting this monthly competition, which started as zero percent point nine and eight, initiated by the banks with the encouragement of our President," he said.
"Green Passport, we will order our exporter"
"In the coming period, we will win the world, we will be scooped," said Nihat Zeybekci, "We will not leave a country that has not been visited in the world under the leadership of our President and Prime Minister, we will not leave a door that has not been stolen."
We won't leave anyone we haven't contacted about increasing our trade.
“We will never, ever ignore this; we will not be the birds in the hand as we pursue the bird in the branch,” he said.
Zeybekci also stated that exporters will be given green passports in the future, adding that "One of the most recent decisions, which came out of its law, we have now completed its regulation in the Ministry of Economy; We will give our exporters the privileged green passport, which represents this country, to our exporters about 17 to 20 thousand as the first numbers," he said.
“Those found in the Darby Entry need to be cleaned up by the state.”
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek, referring to the 15 July coup attempt and the state of emergency declared after it, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek described the coup attempt as a "nightmare" and said, "But it is behind, we have to look ahead now."
"Of course, those who are involved in this uprising and those who are involved in this coup attempt need to be cleared from the state, and this process is in progress; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to avoid confronting such coup attempts again."
As a climate for these administrative reforms, the State of Emergency has been declared and so far serious structural reforms have been carried out.
“When we did all this, of course, we acted within the democratic principles and the state of law, and we will continue to do so,” he said.
Expressing that life has returned to normal in many areas, <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek stressed that there is not the slightest reason for companies and individuals not involved in the financing of terrorism to worry.
"I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy have been solidified, because when you look at the origins of the problems of the recent past, you will surely see that this network of betrayal is involved.
“Therefore, clearing this terrorist organization from the state, closing this period in Turkey will strengthen Turkey’s democracy,” he said.
Expressing that the foundations of the economy are generally sound and they are returning to normal structural reform agendas in no time, <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek said, "Turkey has returned to its original agenda, there is progress in structural reforms."
Structural reforms are already inevitable, because populism and protectionism are on the rise in the world.
"Turkey can only prepare for the future by reforming," he said.
Lastly, <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek emphasized that Turkey will not break away from the West and said, “Turkey may sometimes disagree with our Western allies and friends, but Turkey does not break away from the West and does not give up on the European Union.”

Britain should channel its Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will offer renovation and prosperity not only in our local communities and in London, but also across the country.
I think this will make Heathrow as attractive as it was in London 2012, where we have made incredible efforts for all nations and regions to benefit from the Games.
The Olympics provided great advantages for Stratford and East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies close to Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new internships for our local communities alone, 40,000 new jobs, and we will not leave unemployed youth around the airport.
As before London 2012, there will be those who think the struggle to expand Heathrow is too challenging.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and that we would be a disgrace to the world.
Those who doubted were wrong in 2012, and it will be seen that they were wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all questions.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
Expansion opens the opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs and <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in economic growth, leaving many skills and jobs available both around the airport and across the UK.
At Heathrow, we have a great team from T5 (which was named the world’s best airport terminal for five consecutive years) to T2, putting in place a timely and budget-friendly <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment for the world’s two busiest tracks.
We are now ready to offer a third runway backed by private investment worth <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the United Kingdom, and I have no doubt that Heathrow expansion will be the same.
It is time to secure our commercial future by channeling this Olympic spirit to the expansion of Heathrow, and to create many skills and jobs that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow and Former Secretary of the Treasury
Adblock Plus is like a cat-and-mouse game on Facebook ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to block ad-blocking software resemble a cat-and-mouse game, according to one of the companies that makes the software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blockers on its desktop site, Adblock Plus released a blog post saying users could update their filters to block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the code around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to detect which part of the page is ads.
But Adblock now says it’s decoding new code.
In a blog post, a spokesperson for Adblock, Ben Williams, wrote that “a struggle for a back and forth between the community of blocking open-source ads and those who are trying to prevent them has been ongoing since the moment ad blocking was invented” and that Facebook could soon be able to produce its own solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company is involved in this struggle shows how much ad blockers are causing concern for the industry.
According to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, about 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers, four times the number of people using this type of software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84% of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
According to a spokesperson, mobile ad blockers are not effective on Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, so the company is chasing ad blockers on the desktop.
Since Facebook considers this type of move to be worth investing, desktop ads should still be able to generate enough revenue.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced it would update its “ad preferences” tool so that people can better control the ads that are offered to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were alarming, blocking some of the non-advertising content on the site.
A Facebook spokesperson said in an email: “This doesn’t offer people a good experience and we plan to deal with this problem.”
Ad blockers are atrocious tools, so we’re focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to give people control.
A woman runs into a Swiss highway; it looks like suicide
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
Police are searching for witnesses who witnessed the woman being hit by several cars on the highway earlier Thursday in what appeared to be a suicide.
The incident occurred on A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Vaud police said in a statement that the woman had been lying on the ground "desperately" in the dark of the night and several vehicles had crashed into her.
A 49-year-old Swedish woman, who was clearly intent on killing herself, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He lost his life at the scene.
Police said they had been interviewed by several of the drivers involved, but some could not be identified, and asked them and everyone involved to contact them.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve that "a criminal prosecution has been opened as a "reasonable" step in such cases."
However, it is not yet known if the drivers involved will face any charges.
Is it possible to avoid collision?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases (both involving a person walking on the highway in the dark), the newspaper ruled that it was normal for drivers not to expect a pedestrian on the highway to cross the street at midnight.
Last year, in August 2014, on A1, a police officer was found not guilty of causing death by negligence after he crashed into a man lying on the road near Paynerne.
The 22-year-old victim was said to have been drunk and passed out on the way.
The court stated that the police officer, who was responding to an emergency call, reasonably used the vehicle and the presence of a man on the road was “absolutely exceptional and unpredictable.”
Those who have information about this incident near Morges on Thursday should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for living
According to the predictions of the new NASA climate model, there were once favorable conditions for life on Venus.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its warm, water-free surface and CO2-filled atmosphere, was once home to conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have in the past explained the low rotational speed of Venus with a thick layer of atmosphere.
However, the latest estimates suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and may still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of the old Venus.
While there are more dry regions of its planet than Earth, it may have once had enough water and protection against rapid evaporation with geographic variability.
The ancient Venus also benefited from a 30% dimer sun.
GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a news release: “In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus ensured that the day side was facing the sun for almost two months at a time.”
This led to the rains, which warmed the surface, forming thick cloud layers that acted like an umbrella that protected the surface from sun-induced heat.
As a result, average climate temperatures were only a few degrees colder than Earth today.
The model allowed for Venus to create a story similar to the evolution previously proposed by planetary scientists as a hypothesis.
Although it once had living conditions, Venus was exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.
Their oceans evaporated, and water vapor was destroyed by ultraviolet rays.
Hydrogen has run out, and there is only a thick atmosphere full of carbon dioxide that has the lethal greenhouse gas effect — Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in their Geophysical Research Articles.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche antenna
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as Colorado Avalanche coach and vice president of hockey operations, saying the team had no say in the decision-making process.
Colorado’s vice-president/general director Joe Sakic confirmed the development and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as chief coach and vice president of hockey operations at Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
Throughout the summer, I’ve been thinking about how I can improve and take it to a higher level by giving this team the depth it needs.
To achieve this, the vision of coach and VP hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the vision of the organization.
He should also have a say in decisions affecting the team’s performance.
At present, these conditions have not yet been met.
Sakic joined Roy on May 23, 2013, thanking Roy for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakik said.
We thank him for everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach in his first season with Avalanche in 2013–14.
The club scored 112 points and the team finished first in the league, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the post-season games every two years.
Avalanche surpassed the 39-39-4 goal in 2015-16, earning five points less than needed for the second wildcard field at the Western Conference.
The goalkeeper on the Honor List, Roy, won four Stanley Cups, two for the Montreal Canadiens and two for the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers Suspend Strike
The North Sea oil workers’ strike has been suspended due to wages, and the chief negotiators have begun discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against the oil field services company Wood Group is being staged on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"With Wood Group, we as Unite and RMT unions have decided to restart the process for the settlement of the current dispute," the statement said.
In the next few weeks, from the beginning of next week, we will hold a series of meetings that will take all day to adopt a new perspective on the issues.
Workers unions said this was their first protest against wage cuts, which could reach up to 30 percent.
This year, the Wood Group cut payments to its contractors in the North Sea by nearly 9% due to negative pressures on the market.
Following the company’s wage reduction process, a 10% discount was applied to its coastal contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts would provide the company with the space it needs to go through a troubled period in the market.
Shell has laid off thousands of jobs and announced plans to cut oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries while streamlining operations during the merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low crude oil prices, an economic situation arising from Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson will meet with workers' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes in the North Sea.
As he said, the North Sea is vital to the regional economy.
"We need an effective economy for the majority, not for the minority in the North Sea and across the country," he said in a statement.
Despite an average of around $7 billion in investment over the past five years, it is expected that in 2016, less than $1.4 billion will be invested in new projects in the North Sea.
Kepler measured the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades constellation
With its final mission, the Kepler space telescope helped astronomers create the most complete catalogue of the rotational speeds of stars in the constellation of Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the constellation rotate at variable speeds and what their rotation periods have to do with planet formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release: “When we compare our results with star clusters, we hope to be able to learn more about a star’s mass, age, and even the relationship between the past of the solar system.”
The Pleiades constellation is 445 light-years away from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation formed 125 million years ago, reaching a new level of maturity.
They rotate at the fastest speed possible in their lifetime.
At peak rotation speeds, stars at this ripening stage form large amounts of stellar wind.
As these winds move through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a refractive effect on the stars.
As a star grows older, its speed begins to decline.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational speeds suggests that larger stars rotate faster than smaller stars.
Rebull compared the stars to dancers, saying that the big ones rotate on one leg more slowly than the small ones.
"In the country's 'ballet', we see that those who turn slowly are much heavier and those who turn fast are very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades constellation is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparison of star characteristics and rotational speeds.
"The country's constellation provides theoretical models for star rotations in both directions, young and old," Rebull said.
We want to know more about how, when, and why the speeds of the stars drop, and why they leave their 'dance shoes' in a corner.
Rebull and colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the <0xC3><0x9C>lker constellation's rotational velocities in three new articles to be published in the Journal of Astronomy in a short period of time.
