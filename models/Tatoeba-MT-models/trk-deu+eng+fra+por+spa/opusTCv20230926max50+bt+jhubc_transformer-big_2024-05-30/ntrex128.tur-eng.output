Welsh Councillors Afraid to “Look Like a Puppet”
His proposal to replace his titles as Member of the Welsh Parliament (MWP) has raised concerns among some members of parliament.
This concern arose from the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of Congress in the political spectrum are concerned that the name may be ridiculous.
A Labour MP said he was concerned that the party's name rhymes with "Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: "twp" in Welsh means crazy, and "pwp" means poop.
A Plaid party congressman suggested an alternative, stating that people in the party were generally "not satisfied".
One of the members of the Gal Conservative Party said that his party was "open-minded" about the name change, while he said he had a small word game from the MWP to the Muppet.
In this context, the "w" in Welsh is pronounced like the "u" in Yorkshire English.
"The final decision on how to define what the members of parliament will be called will, of course, be the members themselves," the Parliamentary Commission, which currently drafts a bill to introduce name changes, said.
With the Welsh Government Act of 2017, the Welsh Assembly was granted the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published results of public opinion on proposals that have received great support to make the parliament's name the Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the titles of members of parliament, the Commission favored the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), while the MWP title was the most supported option in public opinion.
Members of parliament have clearly proposed different options, but a consensus could be a headache for House President Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on amendments in the coming weeks.
The law on innovations will include some changes in the way the assembly works, including the banning of members from the assembly and the order of the committee system.
Members will make their final decision on what name to take when discussing the law.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
This popular vote was created to end decades of dispute with Greece, a neighbouring country in the region called Macedonia.
Athens has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the EU and NATO, while insisting that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a claim on its territory.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the popular vote on the name change, said he would not consider the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is a price to pay for membership in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Bells Are Quiet Like Churches in the Harlem Issue
Adams said, “The old people I’m talking to say there’s a bar and a church in every corner.”
"They're both gone now."
Adams said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people are socializing in different ways,” he said.
"Bars are no longer neighborhood halls where people go regularly."
As for the churches, Adams worries that the money earned by selling the goods will not last as long as the leaders expected, and that they will "go back to where they started sooner or later".
He added that the apartments of the people living in the neighborhood would replace the churches, which would not help the remaining temples.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments from these apartments will be white, so it will accelerate the closure of all churches together, because most people who move into these apartments are unlikely to be members of these churches," he said.
Both churches were built in Harlem in 1870 by the Metropolitan Community and a decade later by the white communities before becoming the black metropolis called St. Martin's.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A black congregation in the surrounding area took ownership of the building.
Reverend John Howard Johnson led a boycott on 125th Street, a main street used for shopping in Harlem, against stores that resisted hiring and promotion of blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's followers ordered a set of bells as they planned to rebuild the building.
Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, Father David Johnson, proudly described the bell set as "the bells of poor people".
The expert who rang the bells in July gave the team another name: "a cultural treasure" and "an unprincipled historical vehicle."
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this team was the first in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bell team at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin didn't bring anyone to replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complex story, with some of the church’s non-communist leaders playing a role, some of whom were found by the episcopal district, and some by architects and contractors.
The church's governing body, consisting of non-religious leaders, sent a message to the bishops in July, fearing that the council would "put down the costs" on the architects and contractors sent by the bishops, although they had no part in keeping them.
Some in the congregation complained of lack of transparency in the church.
In California, shark injures 13-year-old boy who dives to catch lobster
Authorities say a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was diving in California to catch a lobster on Saturday, the day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. off Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he heard the boy screaming for help half an hour after he started diving with his friends on Saturday morning, and that he had been on a boat with a group to get the boy out of the water.
Hammel at first thought that the boy was shouting with the excitement of finding lobster, but later realized that he was shouting, "He'd bite me! He'd bite me!"
He did.
When Hammel went to the boy, he told him what he had seen: “The entire bridge was open.”
"I told everyone 'There are sharks in the water' to get out of the water," he added.
The boy was transported by plane to the Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was determined to be critical.
The species of shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told the media a few weeks ago that a shark had been spotted in the area, but that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
For research and security reasons, authorities blocked access to the beaches in the area, from the coast of Ponto in Casablad to the coast of Swami in Ecinitas, for 48 hours.
Giles noted that there are about 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s includes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with its department store-style beauty parlors and expert staff.
As UK’s fashion and household goods sales continue to grow as they fall, as part of a strong entry into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, larger cosmetics stores in 11 stores across the country will be tested and moved to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in cosmetics comes from supermarkets looking for ways to fill shelves previously reserved for televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said the number of cosmetics, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, will reach 3,000 for the first time.
Brands from L’Oreal to Maybelline and Burt’s Bees, like those found in stores like Boots, will find more space.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup line, so that most of its products are vegan products that are increasingly in demand by young customers.
Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, will also be available at two Sainsbury’s stores, one in Croydon, South London, last week, and the other in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
With online shopping and the tendency to shop for food daily from small local stores, supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury’s General Manager Mike Coupe said the supermarket chain will increasingly look like department stores to compete with the Aldi and Lidl discounted outlets that offer more non-food services.
Since Sainsbury’s bought both chains two years ago, Argos has put up stands in hundreds of stores and includes some Habitat stands. It says it supports market sales and increases profits.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetic and pharmaceutical department was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tried to open a joint store with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over sharing the revenues of the pharmacies in their supermarkets.
A new strategy emerged after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is said to play a role in the plan by adding luxury skin care brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We’ve changed the look and feel of our cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available to give advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet every need, and our attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are a cosmetics vendor pushing the old shopping style.”
Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal "irritated" Peter Jones
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, left the show "irritated" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from the <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to spend on the home and accessories brand, True.
The two’s work was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning has announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left the lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on Dragons' Den' star Peter Jones' new profitable contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, when Marlow admitted Tuesday at a tense meeting at the heart of Buckinghamshire's business empire that his new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million deal meant he no longer had enough time to devote to homewear and accessories brands, Jones "was outraged."
The company was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was said to have doubled Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he had left True, Jones set off on his jet to go to one of the holiday homes outside of England.
One source said: "Truely was the first among Holly's priorities.
He would have a long-term future to support him for the next two decades.
Holly's decision to withdraw completely shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was too close to launch.
Marlow HQ has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of one of the UK’s top box office stars, this morning’s show host, could cost the company millions of pounds due to serious investments in various products, from pillows to candles, from clothing to homewear, and the potential for delays.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded True with Capp in 2016. Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M<0x26>S’s brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin, the host of I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business affairs."
We fell in love when we had a tough conversation.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for commenting that some would find "non-presidential" and that he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, pretending to be a "news host", replied:
"I've given up nothing."
After Trump described his first call for a meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament, Kim said he was interested in a second meeting.
But the nuclear disarmament talks were interrupted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a "reaction" from the US to North Korea's previous disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing its sanctions aimed at sustaining pressure.
Trump showed a much more optimistic attitude in his rally speech.
"We're great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said improving his relationship with Kim had positive results, such as finishing rocket tests, releasing the hostages, and returning the rest of the American troops to their homes.
He also advocated his unusual approach to talking to Kim about her relationship.
Trump pointed to the crowd in front of him and said, “It’s easy to behave like the president, but there will be 200 people standing here instead of 10,000 trying to get into this narrow space.”
Tsunami and earthquake hit island in Indonesia, hundreds of people died
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was said that there was no need for foreign NGOs.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok is displaced, no national disaster has been reported as a prerequisite for facilitating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not seek international help, which is why the situation is difficult," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children has formed a team to go to Palu, it is not yet clear whether the foreign team will be able to work on the field.
Sutopo, a spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
Given that Indonesia is constantly subject to earthquakes, the country is unfortunately not prepared enough for the wrath of nature.
While Tsunami shelters are being built in Aceh, there are no such studies on other coasts.
Although a warning has been issued in Palu, the absence of tsunami warning sirens is likely to have resulted in loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, it is difficult to travel between many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquakes is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days for it to reach the area affected by the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made developing Indonesia’s eroded infrastructure the most important part of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But funding the deficiencies has made it difficult for Joko's administration, as there will be a re-election next year.
Joko also faces pressure from sectarian conflicts in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative belief.
The clashes of Christian and Muslim gangs using knives, arrows and arcs and other primitive weapons on the streets resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 people and the displacement of tens of thousands of people from their homes.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge scored a draw against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved his team from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge took a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when his team was 1-0 behind, 30 yards away from Chelsea's goal.
After taking the ball gently to his left, he shot towards the far pole.
The shot flew over the penalty area on its way to the top right of the castle.
The ball finally hit the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and entered the nets.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com, "I was just trying to get the ball and find a position. Players like Shaq always go as far as they can. So I tried to earn as much time as I could."
"I saw Kante coming, and I touched him once, and without much thought, I took the shot."
Chelsea scored in the 25th minute with Belgian star Eden Hazard, finishing 1-0 in the first half.
The Blues' striker gave Mateo Kovacic a heel pass in the game before running from the midfield to the Liverpool semi-field.
Kovacic made a quick give in the midfield.
Then he gave Hazard a fine mid-past and brought him to the penalty spot.
Hazard's defense passed and with his left foot he took a shot at Liverpool player Alisson Becker and threw the ball into the back nets.
Liverpool will play against Naples in a Champions League group match at San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in London in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday.
Indonesia's death toll in tsunami rises to 832
Indonesia's emergency response agency said earlier Sunday that the country's death toll from the earthquake and tsunami rose to 832.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's representative, said at a press conference that many people were reported to have been trapped under the rubble of the building in the earthquake that hit the country at 7.5 degrees on Friday, causing the earthquake to form waves 20 feet high.
With a population of more than 380,000, the city of Palu was flooded with rubble of destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation was opened this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with knife wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked people in the area who had heard or seen anything about the incident.
Investigator Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I’m standing near John Street in Birkenhead and calling on anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
“I’m also calling on taxi drivers, especially those who may have caught something with car road cameras, to contact us, as they may have very important information for our investigation.”
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman who was found was a native of Birkenhead and that she was in a private property.
This afternoon, some friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene this morning and asked questions about the whereabouts of the victim.
Investigations are ongoing as police say they are in the process of informing the nearest relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to break into his apartment, but police said no one was allowed inside or outside the building.
When he found out what was going on, the driver was speechless.
Residents were told it would take hours to be allowed back into their homes.
It was heard that one police officer told another man that the whole area was now considered a crime scene.
An elderly woman appeared at the scene.
She kept repeating, "What's going on is so terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were inside the cord, and one was outside the cord.
Several police officers were standing in the cord, spying on the apartment buildings.
Anyone with information is asked to write to <0x40>MerPolCC privately or call 101 or contact unnamed at 0800 555 111, the private and secret crime stop line, which is quoted from 247 of the September 30 diary.
The Cromwell statue in front of parliament was the last target monument in the debate on "rewriting history"
The driving of the statue will be a divine justice for Cromwell's fanatical puritan followers, destroying many cultural, religious artifacts in England as Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the current debate over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the Oliver Cromwell figure in front of the Westminster Palace would be the target.
Neither Cromwell had done the iconoclasm of the English civil wars, nor did these wars take place at his command.
Perhaps a false Cromwell will be sacrificed in place of his ancestor, Thomas, from the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century view. In addition, Cromwell is a figure that is part of history writing, which many people still consider worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “For many Cromwell, perhaps much more than today in the nineteenth century, is seen in his case as an advocate of the monarchy against external repression.
Whether this is an accurate statement or not is a topic of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known figure who represents a side in this conflict.
His achievements as the Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating.”
Pig Kills Chinese Farmer Who Killed Him
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China.
According to the South China Morning Post on Sunday, the man, who was identified only by his last name "Yuan", was found covered in blood with a broken artery near the pig stable at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai province, China, a pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig stable.
According to reports, the man and his cousin left Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and noticed that the door to a nearby pig stable was open.
His cousin said there was a big male pig in the pigsty with a mouth full of blood.
The forensic examination report confirmed that a giant pig weighing 550 pounds beat the farmer to death.
According to the Guiyang Main News, his cousin, whose last name is "Wu", said: "My cousin's legs were covered in blood, crushed."
Security footage shows Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's pig.
While police were gathering evidence at the scene, one of the bazaar managers told Ana Haber that the pig had been kept closed to prevent him from attacking someone.
Yuan's family and officials at the market are said to have been in talks to compensate for Yuan's death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig trapped a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife scared him away.
A Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012. A Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can be a "trigger".
The farmer said, “The pigs are just joking.
They're curious clamps... they're not after you.
You just have to respect them enough.”
What remains of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rainfall to the southwest of the United States
According to weather forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains that will lead to floods across northern Mexico and northwestern the United States.
As of 05:00, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with a wind speed of 85 miles per hour. By Eastern time, it was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, on Sunday.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure strip forms along the Pacific Ocean and begins moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. Rosa will begin to push deep tropical humidity northward, toward the southwest of the United States, as she approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm.
On Monday, Rosa will leave rain in parts of Mexico to reach 10 inches.
Then, the tropical humidity, which will interact with the upcoming low pressure strip, will generate large amounts of rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Regionally, rainfall from 1 to 4 inches in the desert, in addition to sudden flooding, debris flows, will likely lead to landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will bring precipitation rates closer to the size of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain regions, especially parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern regions, especially in much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to reach 2 to 4 inches in size.
Sudden flooding is possible due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, with conditions deteriorating rapidly.
In a tropical rain warning, it is extremely inconvenient to risk going to the desert on foot.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, while boronites can bring dust that is blown away by strong winds locally.
The upcoming low-pressure strip will leave some heavy rainfall locally on the southern California coastline.
It is possible that rainfalls above half an inch may occur in total, which can lead to lubricating roads with small streams of rubble.
This will be the region’s first rainy season.
Some tropical torrential rains, scattered between the end of Monday and before the rains spread across wider areas on Tuesdays, will begin to approach Arizona by the end of Sunday, early Monday.
Heavy rains will continue through the Four Corners area on Tuesday.
In October, a number of temperature oscillations across the U.S. can be seen due to the fact that tropical belts remain quite warm as the poles cool down.
Sometimes this can lead to sudden temperature changes over small distances.
There's a great example of sudden temperature changes happening across the mid-U.S. on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees Celsius between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska. What's more, there's the same difference between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the late summer temperature will try to rise and spread again.
In many parts of the Middle and Eastern U.S., with October, the 80-degree latitude belt is expected to feel a temperature starting from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City can see 80 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher than normal.
Our long-term climate forecast gives high odds for temperatures above average in the first half of October for the east of the United States.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s trial
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee, and the woman who allegedly accused him of sexual harassment in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, were watched by more than 20 million people from six different television networks.
Meanwhile, his stance on politics continued with publishers’ regular Friday’s return to the last-minute schedule: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct the FBI’s investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure Kavanaugh was trying to get his clothes off while he was drunk at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure that there was nothing in his excited statement.
According to Nielsen, it was possible for more than 20.4 million people to watch the trial on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of viewers based on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers of other networks showing the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, was not immediately reached.
Moreover, Nielsen often has trouble calculating the number of people watching something in the office.
In other words, this number of spectators was similar in size to an elimination match in American football or the audience of the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose idea servers heavily support Kavanaugh's appointment, has surpassed all of its owners by an average of 5.69 million spectators during the day's trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC finished second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS saw 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, CNN 2.52 million.
After the trial, high interest continued.
In Friday's drama, Flake swims in the center.
After the moderate Republican office announced it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Kavanaugh caught CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning when he was booed by protesters as he tried to take the Justice Committee's hearing by elevator.
Standing in front of his head for a few minutes while he was severely scolded, he was broadcast live on CNN.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you."
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
In the form of Kavanaugh, he was told, "You have power when all these women are weak."
Flake said his office had made a statement before the elevator closed, and the committee had more to say at the hearing.
All of the cable networks and broadcasting networks were on the air hours later, when the Justice Committee directed Kavanaugh's appointment to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the crimes against the island for a week, as the minority Democrats demanded.
Flake was partially convinced by his conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then a few senators.
Flake's election had an impact because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the number of votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "politicizing" Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of making Britain's future "political material" to harm national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview right next to May's interview on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced May's move against the so-called "dancing game" for Brexit, saying May's proposal, which was to collect one another's taxes on Britain and the EU, was "complete nonsense."
Wayde Sims shot: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in death of player playing at LSU (Louisiana State University)
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims, who played at LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for second-degree murder.
Authorities have released video footage of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to CBS's WAFB, the police who took the glasses from the scene said they found Simpson's DNA on the glasses.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde fatally.
The lawyer said the perpetrator's redemption was set at $350,000.
The Office of the East Baton Rouge Parish Interrogator released a preliminary statement Friday, saying the cause of death was a head-to-head shooting.
The department has granted the right to the Louisiana State Police fleeing arrest arm, the state police murder lab, the Southern University, and the people of the area, who helped with the investigation that ended the arrest.
LSU sports manager Joe Alleva thanked the regional law enforcement for their "efforts to seek justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
His father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU, a 6-foot 6-inch striker, grew up in Baton Rouge.
Last season, he averaged 2.6 rebounds with 5.6 points per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "in ruins" and "in shock" with Wayde's death.
Wade said, "That is what you have always been concerned about."
Volcano sprays ashes on Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater began to move. Within 24 hours, 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded.
The station was followed by a large number of shakings and thunder.
Images on social media showed that ash layers in thin layers in locations adjacent to the city, such as Mexico City’s Xochimilco, covered the windshields of the cars.
Geophysicists have also detected an increase in activity in the volcano 45 miles south of the capital since the earthquake that shook central Mexico at 7.1 magnitude in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Cops clash with separatist Catalans before independence game’s anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday. The arrests came after pro-independence protesters clashed with the agile force. In addition, thousands of opposition protesters took part in demonstrations to celebrate the first anniversary of the polarizing game for Catalonia's departure.
They were held back by a group of masked separatist agile forces, who threw eggs and powder paints at the police, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be filled with tourists.
At the end of the day, the fight broke out as the police used their baton to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups sang songs against unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain" in the form of "No Forgetting, No Amnesty."
Local media reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
The tension remained high in the pro-independence region a year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by the separatist Catalans.
Voters chose to remain independent for an overwhelming majority, but the turnout remained low, with those opposed to the secession boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent people from going to polling stations with violent clashes across the region.
Pro-independence groups set up tents on Friday to block a night of support for the national police.
The show started but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain its independence.
Narcis: “Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying because they were happy to be able to vote, but now we’re stuck.”
Although they were able to achieve a small but vital victory last December, many of their best leaders either were in forced exile or were in custody for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence, the Catalan separatist parties had difficulty maintaining momentum this year.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on her phone against police support, said the debate was portrayed by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," said Joan Puig.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pretrial detention since the end of last year, announced he would compete in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for elections in Europe is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values, the pressure we see from the Spanish government," Oriol said.
Londonderry: Some men arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent around 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the doors and the building.
At some point, the car could have been shot with a spring rifle.
With Menga's shot, Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0.
Dolly Menga's first goal win for Livingston
Livingston, who rose to the top of the league, shocked the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The difference was Dolly Menga's shot, while Gary Holt's team rose to second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team still hasn't won a displacement win in the Premiership this season and will face Hearts next Sunday, eight points behind.
Before this match, the Rangers will host Rapid Wien in the Europa League match on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, made the league invincibility series in six games, and head coach Holt hasn’t faced a defeat since he took over from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses positions against the atrocious guest team
Holt's team had all sorts of problems with the Rangers in the open game, and he could have been ahead long before he scored.
Scott Robinson made the attack, but his effort wasn't enough to score, and then Alan Lithgow, who slid in to meet Craig Halkett's headshot, went out in a different way.
The host team allowed the Rangers to play in front, knowing that they would make it difficult for the guest team to score in the standing balls.
That’s how the big game came about.
The Rangers gave the opposing team a free kick, and in Livingston's organization, Declan Gallagher and Robinson scored against Menga, while Menga scored by touching the ball in the middle of the penalty area.
Up until that point, the Rangers were the side that had more of the ball, but it was difficult to pass the homeowner's defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems,
This game model continued until the second half, despite Alfredo Morelos forcing Kelly into a rescue.
Scott Pittman was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet, while Lithgow threw the ball out on another Livingston standing ball.
Two penalty claims, Halkett's intervention in substitute player Glenn Middleton, and one-handed play, were rejected by the referee, while all of the midfielders that fell to Livingston's penal court were suspended.
"Extraordinary" Match from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
An outstanding performance and result for Livingston.
Every player on the team was excellent and as a result of their performance, they continued to exceed expectations.
His style of play and squad hasn’t changed much since his return to the top of the league, but Holt, who has fired the team since his arrival, deserves the biggest praise.
Holt had too many heroes.
Captain Halkett led a tremendously organized defense, while Menga disturbed Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall during the match.
The Rangers lacked a source of inspiration.
Under Gerrard, they were far behind in their good performance from time to time.
They failed in the last ball. They were able to pass the opponent defense only once, and this could be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the league.
Welcome to Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, both good and bad in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, there were smiling faces and a blue sky.
The meeting took place on the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
The two countries had differences of opinion on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then went to Cologne and opened a new huge mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police provided security grounds to prevent an enthusiastic crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters were present in the vicinity to see the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, mostly Kurds, have also voiced their voices, condemning Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposite protests show how a visitor who is considered a hero by some Turks living in Germany and a dictator by others has led to a split.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in car collision
A cyclist lost his life in a car collision in London.
The accident occurred at 10:15 a.m., British Summer Time, at the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped and the paramedics intervened, but the person died at the scene.
The accident happened on Saturday, a few months after another cyclist was hit and killed in Childers Street, about a mile from the site.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were trying to identify the man and inform his family.
The road was blocked, bus routes were changed and drivers were advised to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Chaos
The prison administration said six prison officers were injured in a high-security male prison.
The confusion appeared and continues in Long Lartin at Her Majesty's Prison (HMP) in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, British Summer Time.
Expert "Tornado" officials have been brought in to deal with the confusion in which eight prisoners were involved and one wing was stopped.
Officers with minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Prisoners with special training have been assigned to solve the ongoing case at HMP Long Lartin.
The wounds of six staff members were treated.
We cannot tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are determined to send those responsible to the police and stay behind bars longer.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, the prison warden was treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October of last year, rebel forces were called up to the prison to resolve a serious disturbance where officers were attacked with billiards balls.
Flood Hazard in Salt Lake City due to Hurricane Rosa in Phoenix, Las Vegas (May Be Useful for Dry Zones)
It's rare that a tropical depression hit Arizona, but that's exactly what caused the energy left over from Hurricane Rosa earlier in the week to cross the Southwestern Desert and pose flooding risks.
The National Weather Forecast Agency issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday for the area spanning West Arizona and South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain at the end of Monday and take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Forecasting Authority in Phoenix tweeted: “Since 1950, only ten tropical hurricanes, tropical storms or depression have formed around 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models estimate rainfall of 2 to 4 inches along the Arizona Mogollon Border, with amounts up to 6 inches.
Other parts of the Southwest Desert, including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, can receive 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, while in secluded areas, this volume can reach 4 inches.
As drought dominates the region, the rains that Rosa brings in areas that are not at risk of flooding can be a blessing.
While flooding is a serious problem, some of these rainfalls can be beneficial as the Southwest is currently experiencing drought conditions.
"According to the U.S. Drought Observatory, slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the problem of extreme drought, at least the second highest category," Weather.com reported.
First, the road to Hurricane Rosa runs through Mexico's Baja California peninsula to make contact with the land for the first time.
With a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, Rosa, Punta Eugenia, is located 385 miles south of Mexico and is heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is slowing down as it encounters colder waters in the Pacific.
Therefore, it is expected to reach Mexican territory on Monday afternoon or evening in the tropical storm force.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a significant flood risk.
According to Weather.com, “a total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected between Baja California and Northwestern Sonora, and it is possible to reach 10 inches.”
Rosa will then follow northern Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression in the early hours of Tuesday morning, then enter Arizona and southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its ruins is that Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and caused a very heavy rainfall in the Southeast Desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening flooding, mudflows in the deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The young boy was found wounded in Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area on Saturday around 4 a.m., British Summer Time.
He was hospitalized and his condition was "stabilized."
According to Avon and Somerset Police, four men, one 17 years old, two 18 years old and the other 20 years old, were arrested at midnight in the Redstock area.
Authorities have turned to anyone who could have had a video of the incident on their cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh is "victim of humiliation and anger"
Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, “a vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and extreme tactics.”
During Kavanaugh’s nomination, Trump said the Democratic Party was “victimized by vileness and anger.”
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and enthusiastically rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's claim that she had sexually assaulted him years ago when they were both young.
Ford also testified in court on his claim.
The president told his supporters in West Virginia on Saturday: "The American people saw Kavanaug's light, quality, and courage that day.
“A vote that endorses Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that endorses one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with valuable achievements in public service.”
While the president spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, he indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's candidacy.
“We have five weeks left before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m really running.”
"That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats had undertaken the "resistance and blockage" mission.
A senior Republican vice president told CNN that the first important vote on the procedure for Kavanaugh's candidacy in the Senate is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the balance sheet is rising
Officials say at least 384 people were killed in the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's island of Sulawesi on Saturday, and a large number of people fell into the huge waves that hit the beaches.
On Friday, as the city of Palu was getting dark, hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach when the waves reached six meters (18 feet) high hit the coast, and the waves destroyed everything in front of them as they drove a large number of people to death.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake followed by a tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster relief agency BNPB, said at an informative meeting in Jakarta: "When the threat of yesterday's tsunami hit, people were continuing their activities on the beach, they didn't flee immediately and they became victims of the incident."
"It wasn't just a tsunami; it dragged cars, trees, houses along with it and hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at 800 km/h (497 mph) offshore before reaching the coastline.
He said some people climbed trees and survived to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed numerous buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the storms continued in the coastal city.
Earthquakes were felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Authority (BPPT) said the energy generated by Friday's massive shaking was about 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It was said that the geography of the city, located at the end of a narrow and long bay, may have enlarged the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "wide-ranging" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He added that the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under rubble of destroyed buildings, with 540 people injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, along the coastal region called Donggala, located closer to the earthquake's epicenter, the number of injured and the size of the damage could be higher.
Nugroho said communication in Donggala was "completely paralyzed and no information was received".
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were reaching the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy even in its present state, but the situation can get much worse," he said.
Although authorities said the waves had arrived within the warning period, the agency received widespread criticism on Saturday for not reporting Palu had been hit by the tsunami.
Amateur camera footage shared on social media can be heard from a man on the top floor of a building shouting wildly to warn people on the street below about the upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the beach, putting buildings and vehicles in front of it.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the camera footage.
The earthquake and tsunami made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts, resulting in a major power outage that disrupted communications around Palu.
The military has begun sending cargo planes carrying aid from Jakarta and other cities, but those evacuated are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
In Indonesia, the tsunami balance sheet exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Doseba’s statement, World Vision’s team in Donggala safely reached the city of Palu while crossing the demolition scenery on the road, and employees are staying in linoleum tents set up in the garden of their offices.
“They told me they saw many destroyed houses,” Doseba said.
It's so bad.
Even if relief groups make relentless efforts to initiate disaster relief work, there are some complaints that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise have been prevented from going to Palu.
According to regulations in Indonesia, money, supplies and human assistance from abroad can begin to flow only if a disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
This announcement has not yet been made.
"This is still a disaster at the regional level," Indonesian Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani said.
“We may be open to international help after the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night in Palu, following Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, families and relatives of missing people still hope that there may be miracles that disrupt the unpleasant stories of natural disasters of their loved ones.
A small child was pulled out of the sewers on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue teams pulled out a woman trapped under a pile of rocks that had been caused by the flood for two days, along with her mother's body.
Indonesian paragliding national team coach Gendon Subandono was training two of his missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
According to Mr. Mandagi's information, the remains of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a veteran in the paragliding field, I'm pulling my own emotional load," he said.
Gendon explained how during the hours when the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to Palu contestants attending the beach festival.
However, the messages remained a grey check mark instead of a double blue check mark.
"I think that means the messages can't be transmitted," he said.
Thieves received $26,750 during the ATM filling process at Newport on the Levee
According to the Newport Police Department, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who filled an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said the driver was unloading the ATM at the entertainment facility and preparing to charge more money.
While the attendant was busy, another man "running after the brink employee" stole a bag full of money to be loaded into the ATM.
Witnesses said more than one suspect had fled the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved.
Those who have information about their identities need to contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday: “The person who is officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, had been using the nickname Ye for a while, and gave it the name for its eighth album, which was released in June.
The change was made before the release of Saturday Night Live, which is expected to introduce its new album Yandhi.
According to the producer, she will be the replacement for Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "emotional reasons."
West said that this word was not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it also meant something to him in religious terms.
When West spoke to Big Boy about the title of his album earlier this year, he said, “I think ‘yes’ is the most used word in the Bible, and it means ‘you’ in the Bible.”
"So I am you, I am us, we are the event.
From Kanye, which means the only one, our good, our bad, our confusion, it has turned into Ye, a reflection of all of us.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs had several nicknames, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred Love and Brother Love.
Previously working with West, JAY-Z also uses its name with or without tilt and with capital letters or small letters.
Mexican Amlo pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of its bloody retaliatory action against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use military force to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military units opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people in South America during a time when left-wing student movements were taking root.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing students with monthly aid and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attracted young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its artificial intelligence funds
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who previously worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this area as China is increasing its effectiveness in AI.
After announcements of artificial intelligence from various U.S. public institutions, comments came that the U.S. in general did not even have an official artificial intelligence strategy.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence, doubling the AI research budget would be a good start," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding would double the likelihood that the next big AI success would take place in the United States.
His book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, one of the most important AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University that defeated the first-ranked American Othello (Reversi) player, and later became a director at Microsoft Research and chaired Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee commemorated the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Authority’s Robot Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be held to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said it usually takes a lot of hard work to get government support in the United States.
“Academic leaders are not China, they are companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited intellectuals from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. study of artificial intelligence.
“I think people who have completed a PhD in artificial intelligence should be automatically given a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the China Advisory Board published the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
Lee said the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to employees in academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other public organizations distribute to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of their academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of the Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced that it has invested $2 billion in an AI Next venture.
NSF is currently investing $100 million a year in AI research.
On the other hand, there has been no movement for months on U.S. legislation that calls for the creation of a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote on whether to change the country's name in referendum
The Macedonian people voted in Sunday's referendum whether to change their name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia" as a move to resolve the years-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked European Union and NATO membership applications.
Greece, a region called Macedonia, argues that the name of its northern neighbor means a claim on Greek territory and vetoes NATO and EU membership.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist dissidents claim that the new amendment will damage the ethnic identity of Macedonian Slavs, who make up the majority of the population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the 50 percent participation needed to hold the referendum would be reached.
The question on the ballot of the referendum is: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, the price is worth paying at the cost of admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO.
"I'm here today for the future of the country so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, which means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would comply with the vote result to finalize the decision.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state election commission said no irregularities were reported until 1 p.m.
However, compared to the 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters voted, participation remained only 16%.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is Europe," said 62-year-old elector Gjose Tanevski in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and his son Dushko voted in the Macedonian referendum to change the country's name to pave the way for NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and lifting the chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: "We support NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads up high, not through the service door."
“We are a poor country, but we have honor.
“If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to other options, such as China and Russia, and join Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe a large majority will vote positively because more than 80 percent of our citizens are pro-EU and pro-NATO," Zaev said.
He said the result of "yes" would be "to ensure our future."
A poll by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Studies on Monday suggested that 30 to 43 percent of voters (under required participation) would participate in the referendum.
In another survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV channel, 57 percent of respondents said they plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said yes.
For the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum will be the first serious blow to its policy by the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes all Brighton defense to goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling disbanded Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win over Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero was able to score the goal in the 65th minute in a funny way.
The Argentine goalkeeper took a pass in the midfield at the start of the series.
After running through the three Brighton defenders, he reached the open field.
Then he surrounded Aguero in four green uniforms.
First he went over a defender and then left a few more on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he found Sterling by sending a pass to his left.
The English striker gave the ball back to Aguero by making his first touch in the penalty area, while Aguero took a shot on the right side of the goalkeeper, Mathew Ryan of Brighton, with his right foot.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero is struggling with some of the problems on his feet."
“We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that point."
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero met the ball at Brighton Field in that game.
He threw a good ball at Leroy Sane from the left wing.
Sane made a few touches before directing Sterling to the distant pole.
The Sky Blues striker sent the ball to the nets before slipping out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 a.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday.
Scherzer plans to break the game against the Rockies
With the Nationals saying goodbye to the qualifiers, there's not much left to force a new beginning.
But always competitive, Scherzer hopes to sweep the pitch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday if there is still a play-off chance for the Rockies, who have more than one win in the West NL than the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies secured at least their right to participate in a 5–2 win against the Nationals, but are still trying to win the first league championship.
“Even if we don’t have any goals, we can do our best here in Denver, knowing that the crowded atmosphere and the rival team will play at the highest level I will face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a launcher for Sunday, but it was reported that they could allow Scherzer to shoot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, will have a warm-up training on Thursday and will shoot in his usual spot on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed player has an 18-7 average with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts during 220 2/3 strokes this season.
Trump held a rally in West Virginia
While the president spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, he indirectly referred to the situation that Supreme Court candidate Kavanaugh is experiencing.
“Everything we do is in danger in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lives.
It's very, very big. I'm not running, but I'm actually running, which is why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
Trump continued: “You see this horrible radical Democratic group, you see what’s happening right now.
They are determined to take back power by every means necessary, you see their cruelty, their abomination.
They don't care who they're hurting to take power and control, who they're going to step on, and that's why they want power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
He said Democrats have embraced the “resistance and blockage” mission.
“You’ve seen this for the last four days,” he called the Democrats “irrible and ruthless, disgusting and liar.”
When the Senate named Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking judge of the Judiciary Committee, high-profile obituaries rose from the crowd.
"Do you remember what he answered?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. Body language was terrible, the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a free thinking platform.
Those who speak their minds are not tolerant.
I wasn’t too surprised when Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I'm the last one among Labour MPs who's been told we're not well received for saying our opinions.
My parliamentary friend Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she took a decisive stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Issues such as a responsible economic policy, national security, the importance of Europe, and similar issues where Jeremy had disagreements with previous leaders.
On Friday’s Nottingham East Labor meeting, the statement read: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today, it is not like the style of many meetings, and even if there were before, the promise of a “more kind” policy has long been forgotten.
It became increasingly clear that there was no tolerance for differing views in the Labour Party and that every idea was being judged based on whether or not it would be accepted by the party leadership.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and my friends, whom I thought I had similar political views before, asked me to make a U-turn on issues like national security or the EU common market, and to take a stand that I would never accept.
Every time I speak in public (it really doesn’t matter what I say), I come across a line of insults calling for extraction on social media, condemning the policies of the center and saying I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one.
I know that I’m more fortunate than some of my friends because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I respect and admire the professionalism and determination of these friends who meet every day a flood of sexist or racist insults and never withdraw themselves.
One of the saddest aspects of this political period is how insult levels are normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn last week suggested that Labour should nurture a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer that free-thinking platform, and with every “insecurity” proposal or change of electoral rules, the party is shrinking.
Over the past two years, I’ve gotten a lot of advice that I don’t mix meat and dairy, don’t say too much, and then “everything’s going to be okay.”
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a student mobilized by the Thatcher government’s negligence that led to my extensive school class failing, I have worked as a local councillor or minister to provide better public services to those in need.
I have never hidden my policies, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has ever been confused about my political stance and the areas in which I disagree with the current administration.
All I’m going to say to those who support Friday’s resolution is that as the country is barely moving towards a Brexit that will harm our home economies, businesses and public services, I can’t understand the desire to spend so much time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour administration.
But the message I really want to send is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, who are and are not members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no sorting threat or political interest will stop me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

AYR 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible AYR takes first place
The two last-minute attempts may have slightly altered the final result, but Ayr was definitely the one who deserved the victory in this fun Tennant’s Premiership match of the day.
They are currently at the top of the league and are the only team in the ten teams to be undefeated.
In the end, thanks to their excellent defense as much as they make better use of the chances they have coming, the host team and coach Peter Murchie are right to be satisfied.
"We've tested our games so far and we're still undefeated, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Ayr, they made better use of their chances than we did.
Grant Anderson's trial, which was translated by Frazier Climo at the 14th minute, put Ayr ahead, but the Warriors' game was released with the yellow card that Scottish captain Rory Hughes saw, so Melrose made the figures speak, and Jason Baggot caught an untranslated trial.
Climo led Ayr 17-5 to the break by scoring a penalty and turning a solo try while he was in the break after a penalty.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's trial, translated by Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
There was then a long pause during Ruaridh Knott's severe disability and removal from the field with a stretcher, and when the match resumed, Ayr made the difference with a Stafford McDowall trial that was translated by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, saw a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of an untranslated Bruce Colvine trial at the end of a hard repression.
However, the home team came back after Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card in the ballless field, and MacPherson's touch from the penalty line riveted his victory.
Kyle Rowe picked up the ball after David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth attempt. Then Climo, once again, almost shot the conversion from the starting line.
Still Game star appears to be stepping into a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is preparing to enter the food industry. It turns out that the player is the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor portrays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series he co-wrote and starred with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the final season of the series.[citation needed] Apparently, Kiernan has begun to plan how he will continue his life after Craiglang ends.
According to official records, the actor appears to be the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player declined to comment on the issue, but a source from the Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan planned to venture into Glasgow's "growing restaurant industry."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without seaside hopes court will reopen a path to reach the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz, equipped with emblems.
An ocean blue flag is waving in public buildings.
All the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "Our right to the sea.
It is our duty to receive this right to heal.”
The memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody struggle for resources in the 19th century continues to live in the memory of the Bolivian people who have no seaside. The desire to sail into the Pacific Ocean once again has not gone away.
These days, Bolivia's hopes have perhaps risen more than ever in recent years. The country is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICC), which will be delivered on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said: "Bolivia is full of energy, spirit of unity and solidarity and, of course, with a positive outlook on the outcome."
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the UAD's decision on large screens. Bolivia had applied to the UAD, stating that after decades of irregular negotiations, Chile was obliged to negotiate on granting Bolivia an independent piece of land for sea transportation. The Bolivian people were hopeful that the court in The Hague would accept Bolivia's request.
Bolivia's domestic charismatic leader, Evo Morales, also relied on the decision to be made on Monday. Morales faces a contentious challenge for next year's re-election.
At the end of August, Morales promised, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
But some analysts say the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it decides in favor, there will be no significant change.
The United Nations in the Netherlands does not have the authority to grant Chile's territory to Bolivia, and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
According to Chilean international legal expert Paz Zárate, the UAD's decision to make a decision just six months after the final defences were made shows that the case is not "complex."
Moreover, the talks over the past four years may have been more to the detriment than to support Bolivia’s motives.
"The issue of access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
According to Zárate, Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted Chileans' last sense of goodwill on the issue.
Bolivia and Chile will return to the table at some point, but it will be very difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the former president and Bolivia's representative in The Hague, denied claims that the court received the verdict at an unusual pace.
Veltzé said Monday would offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in its relations with Chile" and "a chance to benefit both sides and put an end to 139-year disputes".
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue for his political interests.
According to Morales, "Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean."
"This decision is an opportunity to show that we need to resolve past issues."
North Korea will not give up nuclear weapons until it trusts the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said he will never give up nuclear weapons unless he can trust Washington.
Ri delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at the summit between the leaders of the two countries in Singapore.
Ri's statements came three months after talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hinted that he was on the verge of resumption of stalemate nuclear diplomacy talks.
Ri described the idea that ongoing sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration to end the Korean War would make North Korea kneel “only a dream.”
Until Pyongyang takes major disarmament steps, Washington is cautious about signing the declaration.
Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread suspicion that Pyongyang is serious about giving up nuclear weapons, which he sees as the only way to ensure security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The latest collections of giant hats that you will soon see in stores’ showcases have been revealed at Paris Fashion Week
If you want to add bigger hats to your collection or block out the sun completely, it’s easy to find the right hats for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled an incredible range of accessories for the Spring/Summer 2019 collection on the podium. This collection has also captivated the names that set the style trends at Paris Fashion Week.
Unusual hats have swept Instagram this summer, and designers of these hats have put their dazzling designs on the podium.
One of Valentino’s prominent designs was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge that covered the entire head of the model, decorated with feather-like details.
Other large accessories include watermelons decorated with gemstones, a wizard’s hat, or even a pineapple, but of course, these accessories are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne presented another collection of strange masks, which was very appropriate for the spirit of the upcoming Halloween.
Most of the colored masks were covered with seams, and the masks were more like Hannibal Lecter than the haute couture designs.
One of the designs resembled a complete scuba diving equipment with snorkeling and sea glasses, while the other reminded me of a molten ice cream cone.
If you follow the trends in fashion, you’re lucky.
Style experts say these gigantic hats will soon be available in storefronts.
The big hats quickly became trendy with the collection "La Bomba". We have seen straw hats with very wide edges, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
This brand behind the useless hat fashion that has spread on social media has added a big design to the show: The wicker beach bag she carries appears on a swimsuit almost as big as her own.
The featured design of the La Riviera 2019 Spring/Summer collection, presented by Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week, was a dark orange raffia bag decorated with raffia tassels and complete with a white leather bag handle.
Regarding these designs, celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to take their place in storefronts next summer. The designer has made such an impact that it will be very difficult to reject the demand for large size accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are of great importance to the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have an academic success story. In 2018, this success was sustained by outstanding test results supported by sports, arts, music and other civil society studies.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland and represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools work to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their later education and higher education, their chosen career, and to become world citizens.
As educational institutions that can prepare a specific curriculum for students and apply it, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and necessary course in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “When you talk to someone in a language they understand,
If you speak the language of your heart, you speak the language of your heart.”
If we want to build relationships with people from other countries and build mutual trust, this is a strong reminder that we should not rely solely on English.
Based on this year’s final exam results, we can see that language lessons in independent schools are at the top of the score sheets with the highest passing grades.
This year, 68% of students taking foreign language courses completed their courses with a high score of A.
According to data collected from 74 member schools of SCIS, 72 percent of students taking Chinese courses, 72 percent of German courses, 69 percent of French courses and 63 percent of Spanish courses passed A.
This data shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign language lessons as basic skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Language courses, which are elective courses, are now equivalent to FeTeMM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) courses in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A study conducted in 2014 by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of the reasons employers suffer when hiring new employees for vacancies are related to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming more and more imperative in preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills have become key skills in a globalized world as more employers require language proficiency for possible job opportunities.
If the person knows a second language, regardless of the career he chooses, he will have a real advantage in the future because he has this ability to use it for the rest of his life.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, 75% of the more than 4,000 people living in the UK don’t know enough foreign languages to chat, and in no foreign language except French (15%), the ratio of speakers doesn’t reach a two-digit number.
Therefore, investing in language learning today is of great importance for children of the future.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially the languages of emerging economies, will increase children’s chances of finding a suitable and reasonable job in the future.
The languages taught in schools in Scotland are different.
While certain schools offer more traditional modern language options, some schools also teach languages that are thought to be important for the UK in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter what field your child is interested in, they may choose one of the various foreign language options taught by specialist teachers in independent schools.
Scottish independent schools aim to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children for the future and equip them with the skills needed for success.
It is an undeniable fact that foreign languages continue to be vital for the future of the country in today’s global business environment. This should also be reflected in real educational life.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and success to Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools
LeBron will wear the Lakers jersey for the first time in San Diego on Sunday
The wait for LeBron James to enter the Los Angeles Lakers’ first game will come to an end soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will be on the field in the pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
Walton said on the official website of the Lakers that "this time will be less than one minute, less than 48 minutes."
According to Lakers reporter Mike Trudell, James will likely remain on the field for a limited time.
Following this week’s training, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
"I don't need pre-season games to prepare at this stage of my career," James said.
Trump's West Virginia Clock, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts his intensive rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five rallies that Trump will hold next week. The program also includes break points that will welcome Trump as friendly as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump's vote of approval for the vacant U.S. Supreme Court's nominee has been suspended. Trump aims to get popular support in the next interim elections for the Republican Party, which faces the risk of losing its preeminence in Congress in the November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for this evening, on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m., Eastern (USA and Canada).
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia rally live on his YouTube channel below.
Trump will most likely refer to the session this week regarding Brett Kavanaugh, whom he nominated for Supreme Court membership. The allegations of sexual assault and the suspension of the Senate vote expected to be held for up to a week during the FBI investigation caused the session to be tense.
But the main purpose of this intense rallies program is to help the Republican Party gain momentum, which is at risk of being defeated in the November elections.
President Trump's campaign spokesperson said the goal of the five rallies next week was "to mobilize volunteers and supporters to protect and expand the Republican Party's supremacy in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
A spokesperson for the Trump campaign told Reuters: “Congress control is so important to the president’s agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible during the busy campaign.”
According to West Virginia Metro News, the rally, scheduled to be held tonight at Wheeling Wesbanco Arena, "can attract supporters in Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be featured in the Pittsburgh media."
Trump will have visited the state twice in the past month with a rally on Saturday. The US president won the 2016 election in West Virginia by more than forty percent.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Party’s behind-the-scenes candidate for the West Virginia Senate.
Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said: "It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and support Morrisey in the polls.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team remains determined to keep their hopes alive as they approach singles matches on Sunday
The foursomes, which took place on Saturday afternoon after three unilateral matches, gave the Ryder Cup vitality.
The constant transition of momentum from one team to another throughout the competition is a completely fictitious sporting concept, but athletes believe it heartily, especially in such matches.
So who do the players think has the momentum right now?
"They started six points ahead, and that difference is now down to four, so I can tell you we're gaining a little momentum," Spieth said.
Of course, the European team, which was four points ahead and could win another twelve points in the match, finished the day advantageously.
According to Spieth, Americans feel like they’re taking the wind behind them, and many factors, especially the fact that Spieth and Justin Thomas, who play together all day, are in shape and both score three out of four holes, encourage Americans.
Spieth was an example for everyone, with excellent performance from the starting point to the finishing point.
During Spieth's round, the screams of victory from the larynx became more and more powerful. After losing points in both holes with Thomas, Spieth performed his idolizing stroke, which was of great importance to bring the score to a draw.
The match-winning 15th hole in the U.S. team brought a similar shout of joy, which showed that Spieth believed that the U.S. team was continuing the fight.
“You have to push yourself and only think about your own performance,” Spieth said.
All players need to think about it now.
There are 18 holes left to make a difference.
The only duo to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days was the undisputedly top two players of the Ryder Cup, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe’s different but cute duo scored points in all four of the four holes and made no mistakes.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't have a bogey shot on Saturday afternoon, and they also avoided a bogey shot on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and Friday morning at the last nine back grandmothers.
This performance and the enthusiasm of their energies to the crowd, and the power they get from the crowd in return, support the idea that they will win on Sunday. As the day ends at Le Golf National, Fleetwood or Molinari will probably be the most popular players to make a potential European victory certain.
Preferably, both are expected to bring this victory at the same time in different holes.
But it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball matches, and Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogey strikes in the first nine pits left the Spanish and Swedish player on a bad score that they could not get rid of until the end of the match.
But on Sunday, no one can help change the bad score.
Being able to watch fourball and four-game matches closely is a truly fascinating experience. It’s a fascinating experience to see the interaction between couples, the advice they give or keep from each other, and the strategy can change instantly.
So far, Europe has performed better as a team and entered the final day by a significant margin. However, these four matches showed that the U.S. team in particular did not lose its resolve to fight and would remove doubts on the U.S. side.
Europe is 10-6 ahead of the last day of the Ryder Cup
The European team, who finished their fourball and foursome games 10–6 ahead of the US team on Saturday, enters the final day of the Ryder Cup with a huge advantage.
The thrilling duo, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, won two victories against Tiger Woods to draw their score so far at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, aiming to win the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, won against the American team that failed to score in the morning fourball match and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. won two matches in the doubles tournament, showing more resistance, but failed to make the difference.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles game to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie player to win 4 consecutive points, while Molinari, named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, and he is the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in team games, they’re perfectly prepared to beat pale Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a much more effective 5<0x26>4.
Drifting himself through two matches on Saturday, Woods has shown occasional bursts of excellence, but so far has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four-game tournaments, with a seven-game defeat series.
Rested for four morning ball games, Justin Rose merged with his partner Henrik Stenson against World No. 1 and third Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively, and suffered a 2<0x26>1 defeat.
Yet Europe, on a pleasant and awe-inspiring day in the south of Paris, did not manage to do things the way it wanted.
Three major winners, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set a benchmark for Americans on Saturday with two points.
After winning a tough 2<0x26>1 in a quadrilateral ball against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, Poulter and Rory defeated McIlroy in a quadrilateral game where they lost the first two holes.
Only two times in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team is four points behind the singles, but as a trophy holder, Furyk's team must win a draw to hold the trophy.
However, after being second best for two days, a counter-offensive on Sunday seems to be far beyond its forces.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament without confidence is "in no way"
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the country's ongoing embargoes have deepened its distrust of the United States and under these circumstances the country cannot unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the world organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing site, and promising not to produce nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“Despite this, we do not see any reward from the United States,” he added.
“Without any confidence in the United States, we will not be able to believe in our own national security, and under these circumstances there will be no way that we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterates his familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "stageless" approach to which North Korea will be rewarded for its gradual steps, his statements seem important, as he did not unilaterally hand over the lifting of nuclear weapons, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri cited joint statements by Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un at a summit in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work on "de-nuclearization of the Korean peninsula" between the U.S. president and a North Korean leader for the first time.
North Korea is looking for ways to officially end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to loosen tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States first insists on 'nuclear disarmament' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goals in a compelling way. It even opposes 'reporting the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is the empty imagination of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions reinforce our insecurities.”
Ri made no hints about a second summit plan between U.S. President Trump and Kim, which was highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If South Korea and not the United States were dealing with this nuclear disarmament issue, the issue of disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be such a blind node."
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was quite different from last year’s speech by “Mr. Demon President” Trump at the UN General Assembly last year, when he said it was inevitable for North Korea’s rockets to target the US mainland after calling Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to "completely annihilate" North Korea last year, praised Kim in the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps on disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions should continue until North Korea is cleared of nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years, or five months.”
China and Russia have claimed that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council’s sanctions must continue vigorously and without any failures until a complete, definitive and verified nuclear disarmament is carried out.”
The Security Council unanimously increased North Korea's sanctions since 2006 in an effort to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri during the UN General Assembly, then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Hours after leaving Pyongyang in July, North Korea condemned him for "mafia claims".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “reciprocal measures.”
Moon said the “reciprocal measures” Kim was looking for were Trump’s security guarantees in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year leads all of its students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of ‘all-nighters’ working through caffeine.
One academic found that when it comes to taking care of themselves, the students of the world’s number one university are unaware of even the most basic information.
The course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S., was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep therapy at Harvard Medical School and expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
The lesson was inspired by a speech he made about the impact of sleep deprivation on his ability to learn.
“At the end of the conversation, a female student came to me and said, ‘Why is all this being said to me now, when I’m in my final year?’
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me.”
The course, which opens for the first time this year, explains the basics of how good sleep habits help students achieve academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general manager of health services at the university, said the university decided to open the course after realizing that students were seriously sleepless during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section contains a picture of a dorm room where students listen to coffee cups, curtains, instructors, and books by clicking on the effects of coffee and light, as well as how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as what is being told about the importance of regular sleep.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their own daily routine.
“We know that it won’t change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe that if you have the right to learn how smoking affects your health, you have the right to learn the same,” Czeisler added.
Adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students, i.e. sleep deprivation, is a growing problem, the culture of being proud to “work all night” still exists.
Getting enough sleep and ensuring that sleep is of good quality should be a "secret weapon" for students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety. Even to avoid gaining excess weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in starvation mode, causing students to feel constantly hungry, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, received a course from Professor Czeisler in his first year at school last year, and helped Professor Czeisler design the course.
She said the course opened her eyes and inspired her to create awareness across the campus.
In the next step, she hopes to ask her graduate students to complete a similar course before joining competitive institutions.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for the time they wake up, as well as the time they sleep. He also warns them about the harmful effects of "blue light", which disrupts the daily rhythm emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga beats Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's kick led Steven Gerrard's scattered team to a 1-0 loss at Livingston, while the Rangers suffered another displacement upset.
The Ibrox team was trying to get their first away win since the 4–1 St Johnstone win in February, but Gary Holt's team put Gerrard in his second defeat in 18 games as a manager, eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
He scored seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the low-moral Rangers 11 never seemed to come to himself.
Now the Rangers are in sixth place, while Livingston is third behind the Hibernian by just one goal.
Also, it seems that more problems are on the way for the Rangers after the foreign substance that was clearly thrown off the remote side hit by referee Calum Spence and the wound on the referee's head is treated.
Gerrard replaced eight players on his team, removing Ayr from the Betfred Cup semi-finals of the eleven.
Holt, on the other hand, did not make any changes to Livingston 11, which scored a point against Hearts last week, and he could be happy that his solid team didn’t take any chances against his opponent.
Although the Rangers dominated the ball, Livingston did more with the ball they had.
Menga's first short pass should have scored Scott Pittman in the second minute he sent him to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed that big chance by a big margin.
A deep Keaghan Jacobs free kick later found Captain Craig Halkett, but his team-mate defense Alan Lithgow shot the ball out of the back pole.
Although the Rangers took control, in the last thirty minutes there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game.
When he collided with Steven Lawless during the last fifteen minutes of the game, Alfredo Morelos certainly believed he had earned a penalty, but referee Steven Thomson ignored Colombian objections.
The Rangers managed to send only two of their shots to the base in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly Lassana had no trouble getting Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejaria's calm shot.
Although Livingston's first 34 minutes of play have spoiled the game, no one can deny that they won the game with their hard work.
Again, the Rangers couldn't deal with Jacobs' deep-standing ball.
When Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who would send it to Menga for an easy finish, Scott Arfield did not make any move.
Gerrard took Coulibaly in place of Ryan Kent in the interim, and the change immediately showed its effect when the wing-player sent the ball to Morelos, but the effective goalkeeper Kelly jumped out of the fort and blocked the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to thoroughly draw his guests into the game, which they enjoyed playing with the long balls that Lithgow and Halkett sent in succession.
Holt's team could have raised the difference in the final stages of the game, but McGregor stood up to block Jacobs before Lithgow took a broad head shot from the corner.
The Rangers substitute, Glenn Middleton, wanted a penalty for his team again after colliding with Jacobs towards the end of the match, but referee Thomson ignored the request again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years before the present day, and it continues to count... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger eventually developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that would bring the device known as the Geiger Counter.
Since then, Geiger Counter, one of the indispensable elements of science, has become an indispensable part of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: "What in God's name is this?"
"This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms dispersed by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: “Really, they’re definitely exploding now!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the discovery that bears his name continues to live on.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" malicious cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" and kill malicious cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malicious cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from patients and modifying them in the lab.
These cells can "see" and re-inject the protein that is common in many cancer cells
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with varying levels of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize malicious cells saw uterine cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking the immune cell from patients and transforming it in the laboratory to allow them to "see" the protein called HER2, which is found in many cancer cells, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancers," including breast, uterine, lung and large intestinal cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to "teaching" how to take immune cells from patients to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of some kind of leukemia.
Kanye West Participated in Trump Supporters Debates After Wearing a MAGA Hat on SNL.
It didn't go well for him.
Kanye West was booed in the studio after he gave inconsistent speeches during Saturday Night Live to U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would sit in the presidential office in 2020.
After performing her third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great hat, she raved about the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
“I spoke to a white man many times and they said to me, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
But if I had any concerns about racism, I would have left America a long time ago.”
SNL started the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon and mocking the Hollywood star's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee against Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
Though unpublished, images of West's speeches were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West by uploading the video.
West also complained to the audience that he was having a hard time behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
"They bullied me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go on stage with that hat."
They bullied me!
And then they say I’m in a sinking place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see some sunken ground?" and, "I'm going to put on my superman cape, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try the love."
According to Variety, West's comments were booed by the audience at least twice, and SNL cast players seemed embarrassed, with a person from the surroundings telling the press: "The whole studio is buried in the dead silence."
West was called up at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with his I Love it song, disguised as a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from TPUSA president Candace Turner, a conservative group, in a tweet: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STOPPING UP.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is "whoever but she is, and that's absolutely great."
“But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing, or by supporting his art) who I think embraces and distributes the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
And so are we,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "the entity officially known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, changed his name to Snoop Lion. Of course, the deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and became an artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his fighting Jon Snow character in HBO's fantasy medieval series Game of Thrones, which features violent scenes.
But the 31-year-old actor made harsh criticism of the macho heroic cliché. The celebrity actor noted that highlighting such roles on the screen often leads young men to feel that they have to be tough in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture appendix, Kit said he thought "something went wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, who is 31 years old and co-star in the series Game of Thrones, said he was "deeply thinking" about going over the issue.
"I'm thinking deeply about this personally right now. What did we do wrong with masking?
From the point of view of this problem that we are currently experiencing, what are we teaching men wrong when they are growing up?”
Kit believes television may be a part of strengthening toxic masculinity due to over-masculinity characters.
Then he said, “What is it that you have been taught?”
What is being taught to young men on television and on the street that these young men feel compelled to possess certain traits of masculinity?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is: How can we change this?
“It’s clear that things are not going well for young men.”
In an interview, Kit said he would no longer play in episodes or sequels that tell the story of the series characters after Game of Thrones ended next summer, and that he was "bored of battlefields and horses".
Kit will play in Sam Shepard's play The Wild West, which re-enacted in November. The game tells the story of a filmmaker and his burglar brother.
The actor recently revealed that the most beautiful thing that Game of Thrones brought to him was his meeting with his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife in this series, which in a way, presented me my future family and my next life," Kit said.
Rose was the lover of the character Jon Snow played by Kit in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, the virus has affected more than 820,000 people in the country.
More than 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Unlike previous cases, most of the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly as a result of infected blood transfusions in some parts of China.
However, Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said the number of people infected with HIV through blood transfusions had dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people each year.
The HIV virus transmitted through sexual contact is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has continued.
It is estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sexual relations with men marry women because of the country’s conservative values.
The disease is often transmitted due to insufficient attention to protection during these same-sex relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide general access to HIV drugs as part of its disease-fighting efforts.
Maxine Waters, criticizing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories", denied that one of her employees had leaked data from Republican Party senators.
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees shared personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the senators' Wikipedia pages.
Democrat Los Angeles MP Waters said the allegations were backed by "extreme-right" political commentators and websites.
On Twitter, Waters said, “Lies, lies, and lower lies.”
The information shared includes the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
This information about members of Congress was posted on the Internet by an anonymous person during a Senate group session on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday.
The leak occurred after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Web sites with conservative views, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address of the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office, and one of Waters' employees posted the information.
Waters said, “These false claims are completely false and a direct lie.”
“My employee, whose identity, personal information and security are compromised by these false and unfounded claims, is in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
These false claims are completely false and untrue.”
Waters's statement sparked some online reactions, including White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote in his statement.
"It shows that the Watters do not have the necessary restraint to become a Congressman.
When someone is accused of a crime they did not commit, they should not be angry.
He should not tolerate criticism.
The accused should not question the intent of the accused.
It needs to be calm and comfortable.”
With these words, Fleischer compared the reaction of Judge Kavanaugh to Waters, who was criticized by the Democrats for appearing too angry at the session on Thursday.
Republican Omar Navarro, who ran for Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter:
"If it's true, the earth moves."
Waters said in a statement that his office had "informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement about these false allegations".
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and accountable to the law for these dangerous actions that could harm all of my employees," Waters said in a statement.
Johnny English Back at Work: Rowan Atkinson's inadequate agent parody
Now it has become a tradition to associate all new English-made films with Brexit. We can also continue this tradition for the Johnny English action comedy parody, which began with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to the screen in 2011 with Johnny English's Return.
Will our country’s new export opportunity be the irony of our own self-hijacking film about how awful we are?
At least, the incompetent Johnny English character, who is notable for his bursting eyes and moving gestures, was able to renew his license to screw things up once again. In fact, even the Johnny English name suggests that the character is an inclusive comedy item developed for film lovers who do not speak English.
Despite his strangely confident and friendly charm, Johnny English is an absurdly secret agent inspired by Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and the character who accompanied Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In fact, it was inspired by a mysterious international traveler portrayed by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, who eventually created chaos in every job he did.
You can find some funny scenes in this new Johnny English movie.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter with his medieval battle armor and hit the helmet of the helicopter propeller and made a noise.
Atkinson's physical comedy skills are eye-catching, but I found the element of humor in the film very weak and oddly unnecessary. Especially considering that "serious" films like 007 and Mission Impossible also incorporate comedy material in their scripts in a confident manner, the film's humor is likely to be overrated.
His sense of humor in the film seems to be more directed at children than at adults, and I think the strange misfortunes that have happened to Johnny English are not as creative and thought-provoking as Atkinson's character in the silent film comedy Bean.
In this film, the subject of the series is that Great Britain is in grave danger.
A cybercriminal infiltrates Britain's top-secret agent network, revealing the identities of all the agents working on the field in the UK, and terrifying the agent on the night shift. Unfortunately, Kevin Eldon, who portrays the acting of the vigilante agent, can only be seen in this small role in the film.
For a self-confident prime minister whose political popularity has reached a point of complete exhaustion, this is the last straw: Emma Thompson has done her best to portray the character that resembles Theresa May, but the script doesn’t offer enough text to work on and improve it.
The prime minister’s intelligence advisers say the prime minister has been given the identities of all active agents and must appoint a retired agent to do so.
This retired agent is the incompetent Johnny English. After retirement, Johnny English teaches at a school where rich students attend, but also teaches how to be an undercover agent off-the-book: there were some funny jokes in these scenes where English founded a School of Rock-type spy academy.
English is immediately taken to Whitehall Palace for an emergency briefing and reunites with Bough, a former deplorable deputy portrayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is married to a submarine officer, and Vicki Pepperdine, who plays Bough's wife, is a little wasted in this role.
The duo, known for their horrific messing things up in Her Majesty's Secret Service, embark on an adventure again and meet the beautiful female fatale character Ophelia Bulletova, portrayed by Olga Kurylenko.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister is under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve the UK’s cyber problem: the evil character Jason Volta is portrayed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their adventure full of absurd fun: they disguise themselves as waiters and set fire to a luxurious French restaurant; they cause chaos as they try to sneak into Volta's luxury yacht. English causes complete chaos when they try to use their Virtual Reality glasses to find out the plan of Volta's home.
All these events are linked to a point at the end of the script, but no matter how cute and humorous the film is, it has a sense of humor in television programs for children in general.
The jokes are pretty mediocre.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Could the British film industry not really give Rowan Atkinson a role worthy of his talent?
Labour denies it has developed a plan for British workers to start work four days a week and receive five-day wages.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to develop a radical plan that includes working four days a week without any cuts in employee salaries.
Rumor has it that the party is urging its company bosses to extend the weekend by one more day to benefit workers from the savings achieved through artificial intelligence.
According to the plan, employees will have three days off the week, but will continue to receive the same pay.
Sources said the idea was "appropriate" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to direct the country to beneficial policies for workers.
The British Labor Unions Congress also supports the offer to work four days a week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected by the end of the year.
This is not a plan that can happen overnight, but the idea of working four days a week is a wish that is in line with the party’s policy of rebalancing the economy in favor of the workers and its overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first party to put forward this idea. The Greens promised to work four days a week in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this request is currently not fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The plan to work four days a week is not part of the party’s policies and is not currently being evaluated by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell detailed his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labor Party conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "unidentified managers" and "rentors" in public services firms.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies will not be able to recover all of their shares in the company, as the Labour government can make "cuts" if it is concluded that there is corruption.
McDonnell also confirmed plans for workers to take part in the company's board of directors. Shadow Chancellor also plans to create Comprehensive Property Funds for private sector firms to transfer 10 percent of their equity to employees. Ten percent means a maximum annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation will change their mind about Kavanaugh
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh led to a delay of at least one week in the final vote for the judge's candidacy for the Supreme Court. This investigation raises the question of whether Republican senators would withdraw their support due to the findings that may appear in the FBI report.
In a "60 Minutes" interview published Sunday, reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible to come up with a finding that could change their mind in the FBI investigation.
Kennedy seemed more open to changing his mind than his South Carolina counterpart.
In an interview, Kennedy said, “Of course.
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh on my way to the hearing.
After this claim was made, I called him and said, ‘Did you do that?’
Kavanaugh was brave, determined and clear," he said.
On the other hand, Graham seems less likely to change the game.
"I have made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and there has to be a very serious charge to change my mind," Graham said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what it is," Graham said, addressing Christine Blasey Ford, who presented the claim. "But I know one thing: Brett absolutely rejected this claim," he said.
“Nobody whom Ford has named can confirm this claim.
It's been 36 years since the incident.
I don’t think there’s anything new to change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
New York will host the Global Citizen Festival this Saturday. This festival is an annual music event featuring extremely impressive stars. The mission of the event is just as ambitious as the artists on stage: ending poverty around the world.
Tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park for this year’s seventh Global Citizen Festival, where they will both watch the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, and raise awareness about the event’s mission to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. The Global Poverty Project is an international pressure group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
Those who want to attend the concert have to perform certain tasks or "actions" to earn a free ticket to the event, if they do not want to pay for the VIP ticket. These include volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, calling specific people, or performing other meaningful tasks that will help raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
How successful was the Global Citizen Festival, which lasted 12 years to achieve its goal?
Does giving people free concert tickets really convince people to ask for action? Or is there a situation called clicktivism that makes people feel that they are really making a difference by signing a petition or tweeting on the internet?
The Global Citizen movement reported that its supporters have taken part in 19 million "actions" since 2011, with many different goals being met.
According to the Global Citizen group, these actions have contributed to world leaders’ announcement of commitments and declarations reaching a total budget of more than US$37 billion, and these commitments and declarations are aimed at impacting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The group said that in early 2018, as a result of the supporters’ actions, 390 commitments and declarations were announced, and at least 10 billion US dollars had already been paid or collected.
The Global Citizen group estimates that secured funds have so far directly affected the lives of about 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key organizations undertaking the commitments are the UK-based association "The Power of Nutrition". The association is a collaboration partnership of investors and project practitioners aimed at "helping children grow by realizing their full potential". The association has helped the United States to end its 4,700-plus tweets of Global Citizen supporters. The problem in Rwanda is malnutrition after receiving 35 tweets.
Tracey Ullman, the Power of Nutrition ambassador, told the audience at a live concert in April 2018: “With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and supporters of Global Citizens, we can address the social injustice of undernutrition.”
After more than 5,000 calls for action by the British government to improve mother and child nutrition, the government announced it would provide funding for the The Power of Nutrition project and reach 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions, the Global Citizen group said in a statement.
In response to the question “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?” on the website of the Global Citizen Festival.
He said: "It's going to be a long and difficult journey, and sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But like all civil rights movements and anti-discrimination movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
The event, which will be presented in New York this year by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman, will feature artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
Interior Minister Says U.S. Navy Could Use a "Block" to Block Russian Energy Exports
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said he would use the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy resources from reaching world markets, including the Middle East, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia’s intervention in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets, but Russia is conducting its operations in Syria on the call of the legitimate government.
"I think the purpose of [the Russians] intervening in the Middle East is to make energy deals, like in Eastern Europe and in the south of Europe," Zinke said.
He also suggested that there are various ways and means to combat this.
"As the United States, we have the power to keep sea routes open thanks to our Navy and, if necessary, we can block them so that Russian energy does not reach the markets," Zinke said.
Ryan Zinke addressed the participants at an event in the U.S., where the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance group, which describes itself as the “voice of the energy consumer,” was organized.
During his speech, Zinke compared Washington’s approach to relations with Russia and Iran, saying the two countries were in almost the same situation.
"One of the economic options on our table regarding Iran and Russia is to put pressure on them and take their place in terms of energy," Zinke said, describing Russia as a country "successful in one area" with its fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements were made on the mission launched by the Trump administration to replace Russian natural gas, a much cheaper alternative for European consumers, and increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe.
In the context of this mission, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are working to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. According to Trump, this project has made Berlin "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project is just an economic project. This project will double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that there are only economic reasons behind Washington’s fierce opposition to the project, and this is an example of unfair competition.
At a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak said: "I believe we agree that energy cannot be used as a means of pressure and that consumers should be free to choose the supplier they want."
The U.S. attitude drew Germany's reaction, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
In a call to the United States, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), one of Germany's leading industrial enterprises, demanded no interference in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kempf, President of the German Federation of Industry, said: “I am deeply disturbed that third-party companies are interfering in our energy supply.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren Says She Will Think "Detailed" About Candidate in 2020 Presidential Race
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would consider running for president "in full" after the midterm elections.
Holyoke confirmed that Warren, who attended a city council meeting in Massachusetts, would consider running for president.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government system, and for that, a woman has to go to the top," Warren said.
"After November 6, I will think about running for president," Warren said.
Commenting on President Donald Trump at the city council meeting, Warren said Trump was "driving the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has voiced criticism of Trump and Trump over the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Monday, the senator said, “Of course, the FBI needs to investigate before they vote.”
On the other hand, according to a poll released Thursday, most of Warren’s own supporters don’t want to run for president in 2020.
A poll conducted by the Suffolk University Center for Political Studies/Boston Globe found that fifty-eight percent of the "possible" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not be a candidate.
Thirty-two percent voted for the nomination.
The poll showed a higher number of people supporting Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with thirty-eight percent supporting Patrick's candidacy, and forty-eight percent against his candidacy.
Other well-known Democratic candidates named as candidates for the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden will officially announce his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
Track Palin Arrested Monday Night for Violence Against Women
At a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Sarah Palin told the audience: “After what my son experienced when he returned to his homeland, I have a better understanding of the other families who have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and the wounds our soldiers have brought with them.”
Palin argued that the arrest of his son reflects "an obvious fact that has been ignored". Regarding Palin, his son and other veterans, "They return from the war slightly altered and emotionally hardened. They come here wondering if their fellow soldiers, pilots and other members of the army will be respected for the sacrifices they have made for this country," Palin commented.
Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Station, said he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, after Track Palin allegedly used violence against women, tried to interfere in the reporting of violence, and held a gun while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia support new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the new U.S. policy, refusing to grant asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the District of Columbia in Washington on Friday presented an expert report to the court to support a refugee who objected to the new policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff was not disclosed in the Grace versus Sessions case, which was opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge federal policy.
Grace said her partner and her "violent gang-related sons" were violent to her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum request on July 20.
Grace's been arrested in Texas.
Lawyers defending Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, the homeland of the majority of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing widespread gang and domestic violence issues.
Along with the new U.S. asylum policy, the 2014 Immigration Appeal Board decision, which allowed those fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum, was overturned.
Columbia District Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday that the new policy "ignores state and federal and international laws".
"The federal law states that all asylum requests must be decided according to the specific circumstances and circumstances of the request, and such a ban violates this principle," the expert said.
Lawyers also argued that the new policy would harm the U.S. economy if immigrants were not given the right to enter, and that immigrants are more likely to be entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce."
U.S. Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions in June demanded that judges in immigration cases do not grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
"People who are subjected to persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, social group or political views to which they belong, and therefore leave their country, can apply for asylum," Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
"Asylum policy is certainly not intended to alleviate all the problems that people face every day around the world. Even if these problems are serious problems, the situation is the same."
In Palu, where the death toll has doubled, relief teams race against time to find survivors.
The situation is getting worse for the survivors.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who was trying to comfort her hot baby at an evacuation center in the city of Palu, where hope is gone, said: “I feel very tense.
There's an ambulance carrying the bodies every minute.
We have a shortage of clean water.”
Residents of the city were seen returning to their destroyed homes, trying to collect their water-damaged belongings and to save everything they found.
Hundreds of people were injured in the disaster, hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were flooded with injured.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, with fractures in the back and shoulder, were treated in the yard of Palu Military Hospital, where the wounded were treated in front of the hospital due to the continuance of strong aftershocks.
Haris was in the room on the fifth floor of a hotel with his wife and daughter, where he shared his feelings during the severe earthquake.
In an interview with the Associated Press, Haris said: “We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I'm trapped under a wall of debris." Haris and his family had come to the city to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of bullying using "propaganda ads"
The official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper praising the mutual advantages of U.S.-China trade. A week after that, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading its propaganda using American media.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to a paid advertisement published by China Daily last Wednesday in the Iowa state's best-selling newspaper Des Moines Register. Trump began his remarks by accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections. China denies any claims of interference.
US officials told Reuters that Trump's accusations of trying to interfere in the US election show a new stage in the campaign, which was launched and expanded by Washington to pressure China.
It is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, but due to the deepening trade war between Beijing and Washington, both countries are imposing high tariffs on each other for imports.
According to U.S. experts, in the early stages of the trade war, China’s retaliatory tariffs were aimed at influencing exporters in states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of the province of Iowa, who exported agricultural products to China, said Beijing was hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
In a column for the Sunday edition of Des Moines Register, Branstad said China "doubled its bullying by publishing propaganda ads in free American media".
In a statement, Branstad said: "The Chinese government is using the principle of freedom of expression and the free press traditions to which America is strictly bound by by by publishing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register to spread its propaganda."
"On the other hand, when you go to a newsstand on the streets of Beijing, you can see that there are few newspapers that publish opposition views, and you can't find any publications that accurately reflect the Chinese's different views on the country's difficult economic course, because the media is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
Branstad said in a statement that "one of China's leading newspapers refused to publish his article", but did not name the newspaper.
Analysts Say Republicans Suspend Female Voters Before Midterm Elections
Leading Republican names have backed and defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in multiple allegations of sexual assault, while analysts have warned that Republicans will react in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
People had strong feelings about it, and most Republicans made statements that they wanted to continue voting.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell Institute, said in an article published Sunday in Hill that “such statements cannot be undone.”
Reeher doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona’s representative) insisting on an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to win the hearts of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will remember what happened in November and in the future," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser to the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
The Republican Party members, who make up the majority of the Judiciary Committee, chose to continue the candidacy process for Kavanaugh despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, according to Mic, activists chanted "November is approaching!" in the Senate corridors.
Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, said: “Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be unorthodox.”
"People say that enthusiasm and motivation are already high; that's true.
But if they don't like the president in contested electoral districts, the motivation for female voters in suburbs who don't usually vote, and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, can be even greater."
Ford's public statement of allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, which he described in detail, has yet to take place, analysts suggesting that if Republican members insist on approval, they may face a reaction.
"This issue has become insurmountable for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, told NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is a member of the Supreme Court; it's about how Republican members handle the issue and how they treat Ford," Guy Cecil, director of the group Priorities USA, who helped the Democratic Party in the election, told a news channel.
On the other hand, Americans seem to be divided on who to believe after Ford’s and Kavanaugh’s statements, and the number of those who side with Ford is gradually increasing.
According to YouGov’s new survey, 41% of respondents said they believed strongly or partially in Ford’s statement, while 35% said they believed strongly or partially in Kavanaugh’s statement.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents felt that Kavanaugh was definitely or probably lying at the time of his testimony, while the proportion of people who used the same statement for Ford remained limited to just 30 percent.
The Guardian reported that after Flake's request, the FBI began investigating Ford's allegations and at least one other of the other plaintiffs, including Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that he was sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh, who was under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that Supreme Court candidate Kavanaugh showed him his genitals during a party he attended while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web’s Inventor Plans to Launch a New Internet Project to Rivalize Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new startup that aims to compete with companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to determine where data will be stored and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly said that Inrupt's main intention was to "dominate the world".
“We had to do this right now,” Lee said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
This storage space can include contact lists, calendars, to-do lists, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
The app offers a similar experience to using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify simultaneously from a single browser.
The unique feature that distinguishes personal data storage from other technologies is that it gives the user complete control over who can access what information.
The company calls this concept “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the main idea was to bring together resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently operates a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of developers and volunteer coders working under contract on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers from all over the world can develop their own decentralized apps by taking advantage of the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team had not discussed whether Facebook and Google would “make a change that would upset all business models overnight.”
"We're not asking them to give us permission," Lee said.
In a post published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee described Inrupt’s mission as “provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help maintain the integrity and quality of the new web system built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee radically changed the internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been one of the top names in the network neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee, who started Inrupt, will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era of the Web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Remembrance of a Priest Who Received the Victorian Cross in World War I
The only English Church priest to have won the Victoria Cross as a combatant in World War I was remembered in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attacks.
But Vann, who was killed four days later by a sniper, never learned that he had been honoured with Britain's highest military badge.
On Saturday, at the Northamptonshire parade, two of Vann's grandsons opened the memorial.
Vann's grandson, Michael Vann, said the monument was a "perfect symbol" to be opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather's military-honored heroism.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann had allowed his battalion to cross the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very cloudy weather, under the bullet rain of artillery and machine-guns".
Then he quickly ran to the line of fire, drew the line forward with “great courage” and walked alone on a desert cannon, knocking down the three men of the detachment.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, commented on his grandfather's actions, "a heroic act that I know I will never reach, but at the same time benevolent."
Michael and his brother, Dr. James Vann, left a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was “very honored to take part in the parade and that the courage of a true hero has been proved by the support of many.”
MMA fans who stayed awake all night watching Bellator 206 face Peppa Pig instead
Imagine being up all night to watch Bellator 206 and not being given the opportunity to watch the actual event.
There were 13 fights on the list in San Jose, six of which were on the Main Card and broadcast live through Channel 5 throughout the night in the United Kingdom.
Viewers in the United Kingdom were shocked when the broadcast suddenly switched to the Peppa Pig cartoon, as the match between Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald was about to begin at 6:00 p.m.
Some viewers who didn’t sleep through the morning for the fight were not happy about the situation.
One of the MMA fans described the broadcast’s transition to cartoons as a “bad joke” on Twitter.
Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of the Bellator marketing and communications department, said the channel had to switch to cartoons because there were government regulations that said the content of the arc was inappropriate for 6:00 a.m.
"Yes, 'Peppa the pig' has been released," Schwartz said.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said he would work on timelines so fans in the UK can watch future broadcasts.
Coker said in a statement on the change in broadcasting: "I think we can probably adjust the broadcast again."
"But right now it's Sunday in England, and it's six in the morning. We can't solve this problem until Sunday, Monday, in our time, according to the UK.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages when the cartoon went on air, and some of those messages were not very friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem because we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't a technical error, it was a matter of regulation.
I promise you it won't happen again next time.
We're going to put five fights instead of six, as we normally do.
It's unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley reveals he feels like a "second-class person" because of his sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley explained that he felt like a second-class person because of his sexual orientation, but that this feeling gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like him” until he started middle school.
In a statement to Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, which was first presented by Lauren Laverne, Daley said the purpose of talking about gay rights was to give "hope" to others.
He also added that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics after becoming a father.
The original host of the long-running radio show was on leave for several months due to Kirsty Young's illness.
In this program, where guests think they are stuck on an island and decide what they want to take with them, Laverne's first guest was Daley. When Daley was growing up, he said he saw himself "below" everyone else, because "it's not socially acceptable for a person to have an interest in both boys and girls."
"To date, this feeling of inadequacy and the feeling of being different from everyone else has given me the strength and endurance needed to succeed," Daley said.
The athlete said he wanted to prove that he was “important” in the past, so that people would not be disappointed when they learned about his sexual orientation.
The athlete, who has won two bronze Olympic medals, has become a well-known LGBT advocate, calling for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality at Commonwealth Games competitions in Australia this year.
Daley said she felt fortunate that she didn’t face any legal issues because she was gay, that she wanted to give “hope” to others, and therefore express her views on the issue openly.
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with a man whom he met in 2013, Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar-winning director last year, but the age difference has never been a problem.
Daley, who first participated in the Olympics at the age of 14 and lost his father to cancer three years later, said it was difficult to find a peer who had experienced similar ups and downs in life when he “had survived so much at a young age.”
The couple experienced the joy of being a parent by adopting a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June.
“If you had asked me this question last year, I would have been interested in getting a gold medal,” he said.
But there are things worth more than gold medals at the Olympics.
For me, the Olympic gold medal was Robbie.”
Daley's son is named after his father, Robert, who was diagnosed with brain cancer and died in 2011 at the age of 40.
According to Daley, one of the last things his father couldn't accept was that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they were buying tickets to the London 2012 Olympics because he wanted to watch the games first place.
Daley said, “I couldn’t tell him, ‘Daddy, you’re not going to live long enough to watch the games first base.’”
Daley described her father's experiences at the time of his death: "I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and I really couldn't accept that he wasn't invincible until he gave up his last breath and died."
The Olympic athlete competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics one year after her father's death and won a bronze medal.
"All my life I knew I dreamed of this: jumping in front of the fans of my own country. It wouldn't feel any better," Daley told the Olympics.
This also affected his choice of the first song, which was the Proud song by Heather Small, which meant a lot to him as he prepares for the Olympics, and which still makes his hair tick.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 a.m. on Sundays, according to British Summer Time.
Mickelson was removed from the game at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th game in the Ryder Cup on Sunday, but will have to regain his form to make it not a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who took part in the event for the 12th time in two years, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Five-time major champion Mickelson was often at the center of events for the U.S. team, but he spent this Saturday cheering for his team or training on the field in hopes of fixing the problem that caused his performance to drop in the game.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete whose driver shots are not smooth enough is not an ideal choice for the challenging Le Golf National track where wrong shots in the long run remain unpunished.
As if the course itself wasn't challenging enough, Mickelson will compete against British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari won four of his four matches this week with inexperienced teammate Tommy Fleetwood.
If the American team, which is four points ahead of the 12 singles game on Sunday, can start the game quickly, Mickelson’s match will definitely win.
Furyk said he trusted his teammate, and it was impossible for him to say anything else.
The U.S. captain said: “Mickelson fully understood his role today and said he would be ready for tomorrow by patting me on the back and putting his arm on my shoulder.”
"He's very confident.
Mickelson is a player whose name has been put on the Hall of Fame, a name that has added a lot to the teams he's played in the past and to our team this week.
I didn’t want to play him in two games.
I thought he was going to play more games, but that was the way it was supposed to be, so we decided to continue the game like this.
Of course, Mickelson wants to be on the field like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for most matches in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This match could mark the end of Mickelson’s Ryder Cup career, which he never fully achieved in his individual records.
According to Furyk, Mickelson, whose presence gave the team a spiritual advantage, won 18 matches, lost 20 matches, and drew seven matches.
The team captain said of Mickelson: "He has a funny, sarcastic and humorous personality. He likes to hang out with people. He's a really great friend to spend time with in the team room."
I think the young players were happy to have had a chance to fight him this week, and it was fun to watch these fights.
He does more than play.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows the big difference could soon be over.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, has already experienced that taking the lead in singles by a big margin on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable draw.
The Danish player made his first appearance at Valderrama in 1997, when the captain of the Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but they only won by a very small nose difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 at the end.
After watching the 2018 team make a big difference at Le Golf National with a score of 10-6 at Le Golf National, winning 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, Bjorn (in the photo) said: "I always remind myself that we were in front of Valderrama by a big margin, we were in front by a big margin in Brooklyn, but we lost in Brooklyn by a big margin."
History reminds me and the players of the rival team that nothing is over yet.
We're playing full performance tomorrow.
We'll go out on the field and do everything we have to do.
Nothing is finished until the score is written on the scoreboard.
We've got a goal, we're trying to win this trophy, and that should be our focus.
I’m saying the same thing from the beginning. My focus is on the 12 players on my team, but we all know who we’re dealing with on the opposing team. We’re facing the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the challenging golf course, Bjorn continued: "I never feel confident in this game.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Tomorrow individual performances will stand out and things we need to do will change.
It's a great feeling to play with your partner if everything's going well, but when you're on the field alone, you're tested as a golfer.
This is the message we need to convey to the players: Give your best tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, and your partner has to go out on the field and do his best.”
Jim Furyk, the captain of the rival team, expects his players to perform better individually than their partner matches, unlike Bjorn. This performance increase is not considered to be for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points in four matches.
Furyk, who had been on both the losing and winning sides of the matches where the teams' fortunes changed at the last moment, was on the winning side in Brookline, while he was on the losing side in the European team's "Miracle at Medinah" victory.
Asked how Ben Crenshaw, who was captain in 1999, motivated his players on the last day, Furyk said, “I remember exactly what he said, word for word.”
The captain of the American team said: “We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you have to start the game as fast as you did in Brookline or Medinah.
After the momentum has passed on to your side, players in the middle of the game have a big task.
So we did our rankings accordingly, and we brought out the players that we think are high performance. You know, we're going to try to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas took on the task of leading the counter-attack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first match. The other players of the first half of the European team's list are: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
Bjorn said, “I have chosen to keep the players I have chosen in this order because I think this order is suitable for all matches from the beginning to the end.”
Germany’s new warship has been delayed once again
The German Navy’s new frigate would begin service in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but local media reported that due to malfunctioning systems and increased costs, the frigate will not be available until next year.
A military source told Die Zeit that the date of entry of the flagship of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, "Rheinland-Pfalz," has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the German Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery did not leave the ambitious project behind.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, ordered by the German Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
The ships will have stealth technologies such as low-frequency radar, infrared and acoustic signatures, as well as a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles.
Other important features of the ship include longer maintenance intervals, with new frigates expected to serve up to two years away from the port of attachment.
But according to Die Zeit, the latest models of warships that are supposed to allow Germany to transfer its forces overseas will be obsolete by the time they enter service.
Unable to recover from the misfortunes, the F125 was moved to the headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the ship manufacturer.
The reasons for the return were not given in detail, but according to German media reports, there were a number of critical "software and hardware errors" that would render the ship useless if the ship was put on a combat mission.
Software errors are particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be used by 120 shipmen, accounting for half the number of personnel employed in the former Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, decreasing performance and restricting the ability of Navy personnel to make changes to the ship in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the staff, has also become a problem.
The project price is said to have risen from the initial price of 2.2 billion euros to 3.1 billion euros (US$3.6).
With warnings that Germany’s sea power is declining, the problems emerging in the new frigates are gaining importance.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the German Navy's "recession-compliant ships were declining".
The chairman of the defense committee said that despite the removal of old ships, the problem grew over time due to the inability to replace new ships.
The president lamented that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates were eligible to join the Navy.
The National Trust overhears bats' secret lives
A new study is being done on a land in Scotland’s Highlands to understand how bats use land during hunting.
It is hoped that the findings will shed light on the behavior of bats, the only flying mammal, and guide future conservation efforts.
The study, conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common dwarf bats and Mediterranean dwarf bats found in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, as well as brown long-eared bats and Daubenton bats.
During the season, special recording devices will be installed on the landmarks to monitor the bats' activities.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile work using handheld detectors.
After sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequencies of bat sounds will be determined to determine what species is doing.
Next, a habitat map and report will be prepared to create a detailed picture of the behavior of bats across the land.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are more important to bats and how these areas are used by each species of bat.
This information will benefit habitat management studies, such as grassland building, as well as help determine how forested areas can be best protected for bats and related species.
Over the past century, there has been a significant decline in bat populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom.
Bats are threatened by construction work that affects their paws and causes them to lose their habitat.
Other risk factors for bats include wind turbines, lighting vehicles, flies, chemical processes used in some building materials, and attacks of domestic cats.
Bats are not blind.
But their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey at night because of their hunting habits.
Bats use an advanced echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles in their flight paths.
NTS attaches great importance to bats responsible for the protection of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country.
The association employs ten trained specialists who regularly conduct research, surveys and sometimes rescue activities.
The organization established Scotland's first and only bat-specific shelter on the Threave land of Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten different bat species.
David Thompson, the land manager, said the area was ideal for bats.
"We have a great area for bats in Threave," Thompson said.
Thompson, the land manager, said: “We have old buildings, a lot of old trees, and a nice living space.
But we still don't know much about bats, so our work here and in other areas will help us understand what bats need to thrive."
Thompson underlines the need to check for bats in buildings before starting maintenance work. The accidental destruction of a single maternal butterfly can cause the death of nearly 400 females and young bats, leading to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected animals. It is forbidden to kill, disturb or harm bats or destroy their hooves.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish executive of the Bat Conservation Trust, has invited people to contribute to the project.
Ferrell said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and we don’t know what populations of many species in our region are.”
Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "fake news" and suggested that people were trying to "make their own publicity" using the Ronaldo name.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegations.
The Portuguese national team and Juventus forward Ronaldo allegedly raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo paid the woman $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident.
Speaking to 142 million followers on Instagram hours after the allegations appeared in the media, 33-year-old Ronaldo said the allegations were “false news.”
The five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or said, “No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news.”
“They want to make their own ads using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man, I have no problem," he added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations that he considers "unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the privacy field."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would claim compensation for “the spiritual damage corresponding to the magnitude of this violation, perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights that has been seen in recent years.”
The incident allegedly took place in a room at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the football player's room after meeting at a nightclub, where Ronaldo allegedly raped Mayorga.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99 percent a good man” and that “one percent” had been betrayed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual relations, but this was within the agreement of the two parties.
Mayorga argues that she went to the police and agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because her wounds were photographed in the hospital, but because she was "fearful of revenge" and was "afraid of being humiliated in public".
Mayorga, 34, says she's looking for ways to break the deal, as she's still suffering from the alleged trauma.
Ronaldo was about to be transferred from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he transferred to Italian giant Juventus for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: Britain 'will always regret losing automakers'
Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark said he would "always regret it" if Britain lost its position of world leader in automotive production after Brexit.
Toyota added that it was "concernful" that Britain would notify the BBC that they would temporarily suspend production at the Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need to make a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, extending the waiting period at the border could cause people to lose their jobs.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis-produced Burnaston plant produced 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota’s Burnaston plant, said: “My opinion is that if the UK withdraws from the EU by the end of March, production in our factory will stop.
Automobile manufacturers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have also raised fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will operate.
BMW says it will shut down its Mini facility in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are based on what automakers call risks in the supply chain if Brexit takes place without an agreement.
The Toyota production line works “on time” with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU every 37 minutes for bespoke cars.
If the UK withdraws from the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there may be a disruption in customs. According to the industry, this disruption could lead to delays and inability to supply parts.
The company said it was impossible for Toyota to keep inventory at its Derbyshire plant for more than a day, so production would stop.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan was "clearly adjusted to prevent these border controls" in terms of future relations with the EU.
"We need to make a deal. As I said, we want to make the best deal that will allow us to have this opportunity, not just a deal that will lead us to success for now," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“According to evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers, we should be able to continue our highly successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not determine how long production would stop, but warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the facility’s competitiveness and would ultimately leave people out of work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and the unit’s union meeting organiser, said: “In my experience, these things don’t come back once they’re gone.
A government spokesperson said: “We need to come up with a clear and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU.”
White House: Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's big meeting with Deputy Justice Secretary Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" as discussions continue on Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein directs the work of specially-appointed prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s election interference, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s possibility of obstructing justice.
For months, rumors have surfaced in Washington about whether Trump will fire his deputy minister, jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had raised the issue of wearing a wire to record his conversations with Trump, and the 25th amendment to depose the president.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But he went to the White House last Monday, among his claims that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, who was in New York at the time at the United Nations, would be held on Thursday.
Trump said he "preferred" not firing Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate Justice Commission hearing between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the two women who accused him of sexual abuse and referred to his statements.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh’s allegations for a week, delaying the Senate’s full vote again.
Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said, "There's no date set for this, it could be this week, but given everything else in the Supreme Court, it's possible to postpone it for another week.
But we'll see. And I always want to keep the press informed about the developments," he said.
Some reporters oppose the announcement, saying Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host of the show, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not because TV reporters were "playing for the tribunes," but added: "But I can't deny they were playing for the tribunes."
Sanders later suggested that direct contact with Trump and the press would increase.
"Trump is holding more question-and-answer sessions than any president before him," he said. "We have examined the numerical data," he added, without citing a source.
“The briefings will continue, but if there is a chance for the press to direct their questions about the United States to the president, it will be much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this a lot, and you've seen us do this many times in recent weeks, and when you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's going to replace the press briefing."
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with high-ranking visitors.
Solo press conferences don’t happen very often.
The president may have shown why by speaking too freely in front of reporters gathered in New York this week and occasionally giving strange images.
Health Minister writes to EU employees at Scotland's NHS about Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to EU employees at Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) expressing their gratitude and asking them to continue working after Brexit.
Scottish Parliamentwoman Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to bear the cost of finalized location applications for EU citizens working in transferred public services.
"Negotiations on the withdrawal between the UK and the EU continued throughout the summer and opened the way for the expected decisions this autumn.
But the British government has also accelerated its preparations in case there is no agreement.
I know this is a very difficult time for all of you.
So I wanted to say once again how much I value the contributions of each member of our staff, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues in the EU and abroad strengthen and improve health care work while at the same time providing valuable experience and skills that benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love for you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie injured in head surgery
According to Mike Organ in Tennessee, Tennessee State Tigers defender Christiion Abercrombie was rushed to surgery on Saturday after he suffered a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
Reed said, "He came to the edge of the field and collapsed where he was."
The coaches and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the field edge and then they put the footballer on a stretcher and took him to a detailed examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had recovered from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/degree of injury yet" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
In his second year at college, Abercrombie transferred from Illinois and his second season at Tennessee State.
The player, who played the ball five times in total before leaving the game on Saturday, increased the number of steals in the season to 18.
Higher stamp tax will be imposed on foreigners who buy real estate in the UK
A higher stamp tax will be imposed on foreigners buying real estate in the UK, and this surplus will be used for the homeless included in the new Tory plans.
This move will invalidate Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters.
Tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that <0xC2><0xA3>120 million will be raised annually to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that more stamps will be taxed when buying real estate in the UK from foreign buyers, to be used to help more homeless.
This move is seen as Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to override the success of his effort to target high-income buyers to provide more affordable homes.
The stamp tax raise will be provided by individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK. This additional fee will contribute to the Government's effort to fight homelessness.
This fee, which is an additional three percent to the current stamp tax, including high taxes on second homes and real estates purchased by foreigners two years ago.
The Ministry of Finance predicts that this initiative will bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London's next-generation real estate is bought by people outside the UK, which makes it difficult for buyers to buy real estate for the first time by raising prices.
Because of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country, many wealthy regions in the country, especially those in the capital, have become "ghost cities."
The new policy came a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to allow more young people to buy their first home.
Johnson accused large construction firms of raising real estate prices by landing them early and not using them later, and invited May to lift quotas on affordable homes to eliminate this "immobile disgrace" in the UK.
Corbyn has announced a number of notable housing reform proposals, including lease inspections, aimed at ending "unforgivable" evacuations.
He also wants to give more authority to councils to build new houses.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime minister to revitalizing the British dream, that is, to making life better for all future generations.
This requires correcting our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people to live, work and make a living here.
However, it can’t be right for people who don’t live in the UK and companies of foreign origin to be able to buy homes here as easily as hardworking British citizens.
It's been a very difficult dream for many people to become a homeowner, and it's a humiliating situation like homelessness that's too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest goal is to be Scotland's director"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "greatest goal" was to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish director enjoys the challenge of revitalizing his Northeast club, which is third in the league three points behind the top.
After taking St. Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season, he moved to the Light Stadium this summer.
Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound: "I wanted to play football in my country.
I bought a baseball cap, that’s all,” he said.
"But when I was a kid, I grew up watching Scotland with my father in the Hampden, which always attracted me.
But this opportunity will come only if I succeed in coaching.”
Sunderland's previous managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former manager, who in the past rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, said he never hesitated to work for such a big club after well-established names.
“For me, success is only measured by the answer to the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
“Based on the structure and possibilities at the club, this club is undoubtedly the Premier League.”
“It’s not easy to get out there, but the only way I think I’m going to be successful here is probably to get the club out there.”
Ross, who was a season assistant coach at Dumbarton and spent 15 months on Hearts' coaching staff, is only in his third year of coaching.
Ross also saved Alloa from falling into the cluster, placing her in third place in the league, turning St. Mirren from the brink of falling into the cluster and raising her to a top cluster, winning the title of Champion the following season.
Ross says he is now more comfortable than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real turning point," Alloa said about her time at the beginning.
“I really believe that coaching is the right choice for me rather than playing football.
It may sound strange because I play well, I earn reasonable amounts, and I have good times.
But playing can be tough.
There are many stages you have to go through each week.
I’m still going through the same thing in terms of work stress and pressure, but coaching makes me feel so good.
I've always wanted to be a technical director. I'm making this wish come true, and I'm in the most comfortable phase of my adult life.

Research has revealed that the best time to drink beer is at 5:30 p.m.
The heat of summer increased the revenues of England's distressed bars, while the chain put more pressure on restaurants.
According to numerical data, sales of pub and bar groups rose 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a CGA financial adviser who collects numerical data, said: “Continuous sunlight and the UK’s longer-awaited competition at the World Cup meant that July’s pub revenues increased by 2.8 percent, while restaurants had a profound blow to June.
A 1.8 percent drop in restaurant business in June was even worse in July.
Drink-heavy pubs and bars performed best, earning more than restaurants lost revenue with their counterparts.
In addition, food-heavy pubs were damaged by heat, though not as serious as restaurant operators.
Looks like people are just going out for a drink.
Food sales in operated pubs and bars fell three percent this month, while beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent.”
RSM entertainment and accommodation analyst Paul Newman said: “These results have been consistent with the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The impact of the weather and important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of out-of-home market sales.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer despite the cost pressures of a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year, which is particularly annoying.
The long and hot summer has come at the worst possible time for food-heavy businesses. Time will tell whether the warmer weather we see in August will provide a bit of the relief needed."
The total sales growth of pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July. This is a reflection of the slowdown in brand outputs.

One in five children have a social media account that they keep secret from their parents.
One study found that one in five children starting at age 11 had social media accounts that they kept secret from their parents and teachers.
Research among 20,000 middle school students reveals an increase in "fake Insta" accounts
This development has raised concerns that sexual content is being shared.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "mother" account to show their parents
One in every 11-year-old child opens secret social media accounts from their adult.
A study of 20,000 middle school students, Instagram, a "fake Insta" photo-sharing site, revealed the increase in their accounts.
This development has raised concerns that sexual content is being shared.
Twenty percent of the students told their parents that they had fake, clean "mother" accounts, as well as private accounts.
A mother who found the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter came across a young man who tried to force others to "rape" her.
Research in independent schools conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two accounts. Half of these students admitted that they also had private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many young people’s parents and teachers are turning to creating internet spaces where they can’t find them.
Eiilidh Doyle will be 'the voice of the athletes' on Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as an independent member of the community board at the Scottish Athletics' annual general meeting.
Doyle, Scotland’s best-equipped athlete and president, Ian Beattie, saw this development as a great opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of the athlete’s ten years of experience at the international level.
"Eilidh is highly respected in Scotland, Great Britain and the world athletics community. His introduction to the board of directors will greatly contribute to Scottish athletics," Beattie said.
"I'm ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can contribute to and give direction to the Scottish sport," Doyle said.
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, won four gold medals in total and is now an expert at the BBC, was unable to walk after a temporary ischemic attack.
The athlete wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago today.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that if I got better, I'd know how much I'd get better.
It's been a difficult process, but I've completely recovered, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm practicing agility!
Thank you for your support messages!”
Breast pump ads that make mothers look like cows cut the internet in half
The breast pump company, which likens breastfeeding mothers to milking cows, has split the internet in two.
Consumer technology firm Elvie has released a humorous ad inspired by a clip to show the freedom the new pump gives nursing mothers, which is said to be the “world’s first wearable silent breast pump.”
Four real mothers dance in a haystack with a song that says, "Yes, I'm milking my own milk, but I don't have a tail" and "If you don't notice, these aren't cow breasts, they're my breasts."
The chorus of the song is, "Pompala, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, milk my milk."
However, the ads shared on the company’s Facebook page have sparked controversy.
The video, which was viewed 77,000 times and commented hundreds of times, received mixed reactions from viewers. Many people said the video exposed the "terror" of the dairy industry.
“Using cows in advertising for this product is a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth in order to reproduce, but their offspring are taken away a few days after they're born," she wrote.

Another wrote the following comment: “It is clearly shocking for both the mother and her cub.
But why shouldn't they be used in breast pump advertising for mothers whose babies aren't taken from them?
Another wrote, "It's a very disconnected ad from the world."
Some defended the ad, and one woman said she found the song "very funny."
Someone said, "I think it's a very creative idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd get this pump.
Pumping milk really made me feel like a cow.
It's a bit of an ad, but I got the message.
This is a brilliant product,” he wrote.
Another said, "This is mostly an advertisement for mothers who feel like cows when they pump milk at work or in toilets."
It's not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry or it's groundbreaking."
At the end of the video, all the women are dancing with a breast pump attached to their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is completely quiet, no cables, no tubes, and it fits perfectly inside the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move while pumping milk, to hold their babies, or even to go out.
Ana Balarin, co-founder and creative executive at Mother, said: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a bold and provocative introduction.
By making a similarity between breastfeeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to show the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will provide in a fun and insightful way while pumping milk and bringing out all the challenges of this process.
This is not the first time Elvie Pump has been on the agenda.
A mother with two children at London Fashion Week went on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Quietly Move to Tent Camp on the Texas Border
Although the monthly border crossings have not changed much, the number of illegal child migrants has risen rapidly, partly because of the Trump administration’s tough talk and policies to make it difficult to place children next to their sponsors.
Often sponsors are people who were illegal immigrants themselves at the time and are afraid to put their own children at risk for their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and home adults had to give fingerprints, and the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Matthew Albence testified that the agency against Congress had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80 percent of the people who are sponsored or who belong to the family of the sponsors are illegal in this country, and most of them are foreign criminals.
We will not leave these people behind.”
Shelter workers have introduced new rules that require officers to appear in court within a month instead of the standard 60 days after their arrest in order to see the case of the children faster.
Instead of going to court in person, many will speak to a conference call and defend the immigration judge in their lawsuits about their legal status.
Those who are not eligible for release will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the more children are detained, the more likely they are to experience anxiety disorder and depression, which can lead to bursts of anger or attempts to escape.
Lawyers said these concerns increased at a larger facility like Tornillo, where the child’s signs of being in a difficult situation are more likely to be ignored, depending on the size.
They also noted that sending children to tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to their friends can trigger traumas that many of them have already suffered.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of American, French and Turkish "occupied forces"
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallim called on Syrian refugees to return, even though the war in the country is in its eighth year.
At the same time, the deputy prime minister said foreign forces were illegally located on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "what is necessary will be done about it".
He said, “They have to leave immediately, unconditionally.”
In Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more are homeless, the "war on terror" is almost over.
Damascus will continue this holy struggle "until it clears both terrorist groups and all illegal foreign entities from all territory in Syria."
The U.S. has nearly 2,000 military units in Syria that train and provide intelligence to Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs against Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, he said the conditions were favorable for them to return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unreasonable fears" that led to refugees leaving the country.
"We have called on international communities and humanitarian organizations to ensure the return," he said.
“They politicize what should be a purely human matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no development assistance will be provided to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats said the agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone for Idlib, the last major insurgency fortress, provided an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russia-Turkey agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the region, where three million people live.
However, Moullim stressed that the agreement had "clear expiration dates" and expressed hope that the military operation targeting jihadists, including fighters on the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, would be "dismantled".
UN representative Staffan de Mistura wants to design a post-war constitution for Syria and organize the first meetings of a new board of government and opposition members to pave the way for elections.
The teacher proposed conditions for the Syrian government to join the board and warned against interventions, saying the panel's function should be limited to "examining the articles of the current constitution".
Why Trump Will Win the Election a Second Time
According to this logic, Trump will win a new election in 2020 unless the abuse of power and scandal, as liberal viewers probably hope, lead to the early end of his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be the most dramatic end of all time for the presidency.
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
In the golden hour since 2014, CNN's rating doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's rating tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 1.7 million viewers four years ago at the golden hour, now 2.4 million. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is heading cable channels with 3.5 million viewers on its main news nights.
"This is a fire that draws people to itself because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," describing a minister who was president when the building was destroyed by an attack.
Experienced comedian Nell Scovell, author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers an incident in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told Scovell he was going to give the game to Trump.
The author asked, "Why?"
The driver said, "Because it makes me laugh."
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the plots from Washington can determine Roe v. Wade's future, whether migrant families can reunite, and the state of the global economy.
Staying away from the agenda is a luxury that only very privileged audiences can afford.
But experts on the panel use Bob Woodward's "detailed information" as a method of reference in his book Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather bomber jacket (a kind of proudly-covered garment, according to the Washington Post) and Stormy Daniels's over-the-clock description of Trump's, well, his anatomy.
I can't look at Super Mario in the same way.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” said about the changing team of Trump’s program and its changing themes every day (fighting with the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un...), “What makes the program look like a reality show is that it gives you something every night.”
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you'll be left behind.

Fleiss told me, “I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows, people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’”

External money flows into the most difficult midterm election that the White House has attended
It’s no surprise that the vote shift, which put two officials in the congressional districts in the same position, saw the cash flow in Pennsylvania’s 17th district.
The newly organized Pittsburgh suburb is putting Democratic MP Conor Lamb in the race, who took part in another district in the election last spring.
Lamb competes against another island, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were re-drawn in January as the Supreme Court ruled that the former districts were set in the interests of the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th district was the stage for a crackdown election campaign funding race between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name after he won the special election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March, followed by many by a slight margin.
There had been a Republican in this position for more than a decade, and President Trump had won the region by 20 points.
Political experts have provoked the Democrats a little.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador for Supporting China
The diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama already knew Beijing and that Washington had reacted a bit.
Trump had an intimate meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until partners evacuated the Trump Organization’s administrative team.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month that the ministry had decided to recall American officials on diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recently received decision not to recognize Taiwan".
But the sanctions were intended to apply only to El Salvador, which received $140 million in US aid in 2017 for narcotics control, development and economic support.
Sanctions covering financial aid cuts and targeting visa restrictions would be devastating for the Central American country and for high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the ministry’s meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development, which was a continuation of a similar meeting last year, seen as an improvement in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior executives said they wanted the conference to go ahead, and they did not leave any draft sanctions for El Salvador.
The diplomats said that Vice President Mike Pence's speech at the mid-October conference was planned as an indication of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting.
Three U.S. representatives calmly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without bringing harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, described by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats and agreed to conduct internal negotiations on a confidential basis.
The statements of these officials were supported by an analyst from outside the Palace, who was close to the administration and spoke on the condition of secrecy.
Learn History
Another expected development could be that special prosecutor Robert Mueller has written a report on the possibility of Trump obstructing justice, which has very supportive evidence in the archives.
Mueller’s investigation is expected to determine whether Trump’s election campaign is linked to Russia’s attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will once again find himself held accountable in this community as he prepares to appear before voters, and even a jury of his colleagues in the end.
There are a lot of possibilities, and I'm not saying that the decline of Trump or his European counterparts is inevitable.
There are choices to be made for all of us on both sides of the Atlantic to determine how long the struggle will last.
If the West had resisted Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich in 1938, German officers would have been ready to take a coup d'état.
We failed and could not prevent years of massacres.
History is shaped around such milestones, and the unstoppable progress of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Americans are currently living together on several of these milestones.
What if Mr. Trump removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has faced serious problems since the document, which claims that he secretly proposed to record the president's talks and reveals rumors that the president was inappropriate for the office, was revealed last year.
Mr. Rosenstein claims The Times' statements are untrue.
"How will we respond if the recent FBI-requested Brett Kavanaugh investigation is not conducted comprehensively and fairly, or if he is found innocent in the Supreme Court despite serious allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
After all, are we going to vote for a House that will hold Mr. Trump accountable in the midterm elections?
If we don't pass these tests, democracy will go through a tough time.
But I don't believe we're going to fail, because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was once sent to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, who also occupied my embassy house.
He survived, emigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that table with the swastika on it.
How can I be hopeless about our future when I have such a past?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is hopeful after the Rapid Vienna collision
Following an impressive draw with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday’s field and will have a strong advantage to qualify for the Europa League Group G in the event of a win away from the Austrian team.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans did not appear on the field for the entire season until the 2–2 final match with Villarreal, but according to the player, this could be used as a jumping board for bigger things for the team.
"For us, that was a good score because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went to the game believing we could get a good result and we left with a point.
Maybe we could have gotten a better result, but the draw was probably a more fair result.
In the first half, they were probably better than us, but in the second half we went ahead and played better.
Thursday is approaching and there will be another big European night.
We hope we get three more points, but it's going to be a tough game, because they've done well in their last game, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can push them and get a positive result.
“The past year has been really difficult with my injuries and the changes the club has undergone, but I think our current position is very good.
Our team is good and everyone is really enjoying it; the training is going well.
I hope we can continue this way and leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Women fall asleep because of fear of retirement savings
Although they had clear ideas about how the participants in the study wanted to be taken care of, few talked about it with their families.
Nearly half of the people surveyed by Nationwide said they talked to their partners about long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take any steps to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance company.
You can start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t tell them what you want, you won’t be able to prepare your family for how they will care for you in the future.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to be cared for, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can also provide you with a solution to cover these costs.
A traditional long-term care insurance policy, a mixed cash-value life insurance policy that will help you cover costs, or as long as you have money, insuring your own wealth can be among your payment options for long-term care.
Complete transactions related to legal documents: Resolve legal issues from the beginning.
Prepare a health proxy so that you can choose someone you trust to manage your health care, and ensure that employees follow your wishes when you are unable to communicate.
Also, try to identify a proxy that will do your financial management.
You also want to make sure that your financial decisions are made by someone you trust, and that your bills are paid when it is not possible for you to do so.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine your elderly parent facing an emergency medical problem and on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer the questions you are asked about this person about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan, and so be prepared for anything.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s about who the doctors will be,” Martin asked.

In Ilfracombe, a man opened fire with an air rifle.
During the night, a man was shot several times on his way to his house from outside.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police said the incident, which took place at 2:30 p.m., was a "random action".
Victim said she didn't see the attacker.
There is no fatal injury and the police are gathering testimony from witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed in the Indonesian city of Palu due to a violent earthquake and tsunami on Friday. The death toll is also expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communication channels, aid workers have yet to hear from the regency of Donggala, the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake north of Palu.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Some important information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region. It is located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population is estimated to be 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regent with a length of more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regent, an administrative district under a province, is estimated to have a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main livelihoods of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining in the province is also important, but mining is concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, there have been several tsunamis in Palu and Donggala over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people in Donggala and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, another tsunami killed nine people in Donggala.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific Fire Ring and regularly experiences earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunami disasters in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Northern Sumatra, Indonesia, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing more than half of the 226,000 people in Aceh.
2005: Severe earthquakes in late March and early April hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people lost their lives on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8-magnitude earthquake that struck Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggered a tsunami that hit the island's southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: The 7.5-magnitude earthquake off the coast of Sumatra hit one of the islands of Mentawai, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres, killing dozens of villages and about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in Aceh’s regent’s Pidie Jaya brought to mind the deadly damage caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami, causing devastation and panic.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people lost their lives due to collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes on the touristic island of Lombok in Indonesia have killed 500 people, most of them in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault charges.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, interference in a domestic violence report, and police brutality.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a woman who tried to call the police to report the charges.
According to the KTUU statement, Palin is currently being held at a $500 unsecured Tahville Mat-Water Pre-Audience Facility.
He said he was “absolutely innocent” when asked to defend himself in his trial on Saturday.
Palin faces three different Class A felonies, which could result in up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
There is also a Class B charge against him, which could result in one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't Palin's first criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Sarah Palin, her mother, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being handled by the Alaska Supreme Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in a report on domestic violence, and possession of weapons under the influence of drugs in connection with the same incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched Palin in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
An earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday killed at least 384 people.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication channels are currently unavailable, and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred in the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Videos showing the moment of disaster are shared in social media circles.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspected NYC terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City.
Saipov, 30, allegedly rented a truck from Home Depot in October to carry out an attack on a bike path on Lower Manhattan’s West Side Highway and crushed pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "knowingly" killed eight victims and "knowingly" inflicted serious physical damage on people, according to a document of intent reported in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, both of these crimes are likely to result in the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a major federal jury slapped Saipov with a 22-point indictment involving a violent charge, the destruction of motor vehicles, and eight murder charges for blackmail, which are often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime.
Prosecutors said the attack needed "major planning in advance", and said Saipov's action was "atrocious, ruthless, immoral."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and damage; Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco's family and friends," the report writes.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has been sentenced to death for the last ten years.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug suppliers, but was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death in a federal trial in New York City was in 1953, when the married couple were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago and were executed.
Rosenberg was put on the electric chair and executed on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov of Uzbekistan showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators that they felt good about what they were doing.
Saipov said he was inspired by an ISIS video he watched on his phone to carry out the attack.
According to the police, he even asked to display the Islamic State flag in the hospital room.
He said he did not admit the charges in the 22-point indictment.
Federal defense officer David Patton, who represents Saipov, said the decision was "sad, of course."
"We believe that the decision to sentence the defendant to death rather than to sentence him to life imprisonment without release will further prolong the trauma suffered for all of the people involved in the incident," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put to the head of Brexit talks
Nigel Farage swore that he would "move the people's army" during a Tory conference today.
While one of Theresa May's own lawmakers said she should head talks with the EU, the former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the pressure from the European Union.
Conservative opposition MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage had not been Brexit Secretary, the United Kingdom would have "exited" by now.
Pro-staying EU Tories, who participated in another anti-Brexit march in the city, underlined that Ms. May had trouble reconciling deeply divided party members.
The prime minister is having trouble keeping his party members in line with the plans between Brexit, pro-EU, and attacks from the EU itself.
Their allies insist that they continue their efforts to negotiate with Brussels despite the reactions and force the EU opponents and the Labour Party to choose between the proposed plan and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said he wanted to "evacuate the Chequers Housing" during the Leave Means Leave walk in Solihull.
He said Mr Farage should be an interlocutor and take responsibility for the talks with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible for these talks, we would have left the EU by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will strive for Brexit, but we need to evacuate the Chequers.”
He said: “We did not fight the wars of the world in order to become a child.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone denied allegations that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The thought that the British people had changed their mind and wanted to remain in the EU is completely unfounded."
Pro-Brexit and Tory Andrea Jenkins was also on the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Mr. Prime Minister, listen to the people.”
“Chequers are not loved by the public, not by our party and our activists, who will not win the vote of the opposition.
Please release Chequers and open your ears."
In her message targeting Ms. May, she added, "Prime Ministers can't keep their positions if they don't keep their promises."
Mr Farage said on the march that politicians should "feel the pressure" when they consider betraying the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people and politicians," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’
In his message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want to feel the pressure on our politicians on the verge of betraying Brexit.”
"We are trying to mobilize the people's army of this country, which allows us to win the victory over Brexit, and we will not stop until we have an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the EU-staying pros held a two-hour rally in the city centre after a march inside the city of Birmingham.
After the group's entry this weekend, a group of activists waved the "Torys vs. Brexit" flags.
Working Party member Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives for having suffered the sainthood of a party practice during the opening of the conference.
“These are people who tell us that they can use all the technologies for their information systems and for smooth borders for Canada and for unlimited free trade in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a disgrace.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to have a "deep investigation" into running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she plans to conduct "an in-depth investigation into becoming a presidential candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a member of the Massachusetts Democratic Party talked about his plans for the future on Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has frequently criticized President Donald Trump, will compete in the November election against Geoff Diehl, the Republican Party State Representative, who is co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There were rumors that Warren could run against Trump in 2020.
The event, held Saturday afternoon in Holyoke, was Warren’s 36th meeting with participating voters in the mayoral setting since Trump took office.
One participant asked him if he was running for president.
Warren responded, "It's time for women to go to Washington to fix a corrupt government, and that includes a woman at the top of the state."
A man from LSU has been arrested for shooting down Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police announced Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference at 11:00 Eastern Time that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested in connection with the incident.
The police, who posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asked citizens to help identify a man who appeared in the footage.
Sims, a 20-year-old man, was shot dead Friday morning near the South University campus.
According to 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday that "Wayde Sims appears to have been shot in the head."
It was reported that Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson confessed to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun, and shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Neighborhood Police Department.
Growing up in Baton Rouge, a 6-foot 6-inch kid, the Sims played in a total of 32 matches in the top 5 last season, with averages of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is running for the world title after team's orders beat Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's race, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from his pole position, keeping his position in the first two rounds, forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel, who first entered the pit stop, then left Hamilton behind, which could have been the move to end the race.
In the next round, the Mercedes team that entered the pit stop came behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead by making him leave the interior, albeit unintentionally, after a dual close move that forced the Ferrari driver to defend in the third round.
Max Verstappen, who started the race in the back row and celebrated his 21st birthday, managed to finish seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led a large part of the race, aiming for a quick finish, at the expense of burning his tires to pass the fourth-ranked Kimi Raikkonen.
Verstappen entered the pit stop in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the remaining eight rounds, and Raikkonen did not lose the fourth.
"It was a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman.
The team has done an extraordinary job to get the first two places."
Body language was really bad.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein, who said at Saturday's rally that Christine Blasey Ford had not leaked a letter accusing Constitutional Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what happened in the Senate saw people as "bad and liars."
"The only thing that can happen and the good thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is that we see angry, angry, bad, and dishonest people," Trump said.
You're looking at the information that's been posted and leaked, but they're like, "I didn't do it.
It wasn't me," he said.
"Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked any information?
And don't forget the woman's answer, did you leak the document?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it," he said.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Did we leak it? We didn't leak it," Trump countered.
In July, Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing allegations of sexual harassment against Kavanaugh, which was leaked to the press in September, but Feinstein denied that it was his own office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee: “I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations and I didn’t leak his story.”
"Dr. Fort asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret."
Yet this denial, given what he said at the rally on Saturday night, did not satisfy the president: "I'll tell you what. His body language was really bad.
It may not have leaked, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual abuse by three women, arguing that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They're determined to do whatever it takes to regain power."
"You see how they do evil to gain power and control. They don't care who they hurt and who they crush," Mediaite reported.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars won a 5–3 rematch at Dundee on Saturday, compensating for Friday's Elite League defeat.
With the Giants, Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier's goals, two zeros went ahead at the start of the match.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie moved the host team to the tie, but Dwyer's goal put the Giants back on the line.
Francois Bouchard scored again for Dundee, but Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals determined the outcome of the match.
The match at Belfast was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the students of Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2–1 again before losing on Friday.
This was the fourth match of the two teams this season, the Giants had won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's first goal came at 03:35, the fourth minute of the match, from Kendall McFaull's assist, and four minutes later, David Rutherford's assist and Beauvillier's double.
In the first intensive period, Sullivan scored the home team's goal at 13:10, followed by Matt Marquardt scoring Cownie's equaliser goal at 15:16.
At the end of the first period, Dwyer scored the second goal of the night, leading the Giants to the semi-finals.
The home team gathered and Bouchard's score at 27:37 once again equalized.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces at the end of the second period to allow Nielsen to advance for the first time against Dundee, scoring the final goal in the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes on their field next Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Died to Help Hundreds of Passengers Aboard Airplane Escape From Earthquake
In Indonesia, an air traffic controller is called a hero after a plane carrying hundreds of people safely takes off from the runway while he dies.
More than 800 people died in a massive earthquake on Friday that triggered a tsunami on the island of Sulawesi.
Severe aftershocks continue in the area, and many people in the city of Palu are still waiting to be rescued under the rubble.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save their own lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport’s insanely rocking control tower in the earthquake.
He stayed in the tower to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was safely taken off.
Then he jumped off the tower, thinking that the traffic control tower had collapsed.
He later died in the hospital where he was discharged.
According to Australian ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller’s decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
“We have prepared a helicopter to transport our colleague from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.”
"But unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu."
“We were very sad to receive this news,” Sirait added.
On the other hand, the country's disaster-fighting agency said that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited. Authorities are concerned that the death toll could rise to thousands.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the agency, said: “We believe that the number of deaths could increase as there are still many people under the rubble.
Waves of up to six metres have devastated Palu, and a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting medical aid and supplies to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings new bodies.
Clean water is very difficult.
Mini-markets are looting everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, President of the International Red Cross, told CNN: “As the Indonesian Red Cross, we are racing against time to help the survivors, but we don’t know what to face there.
It’s already a big tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the army: "I want you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation missions.
Are you ready to do that?”
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports a man missing after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline, which operates the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, said 47 passengers and crew had safely left the sinking plane, but one person was missing.
Air Niugini said no male passengers were found as of Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the passenger.
The airline has not yet responded to more information about the passenger, such as the passenger’s age or nationality.
The boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew on the plane that crashed while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were under observation at the hospital and were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and how the events occurred respectively remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses claimed the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was approaching the track from very low.
Jaynes added, “That’s an extremely good thing.
Jaynes said he and others were able to proceed to the emergency exits of the sinking plane that was coming to the waistline.
He said the flight attendants panicked and yelled and had a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working to improve a nearby pier were helping rescue operations by using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 ft).
The data from the Aviation Security Network shows that 111 people have been killed in crashes in PNG-registered airlines over the past 20 years, but Air Niugini has no history of accidents.
The analyst revealed the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors presented their evidence on Saturday in a trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
The analyst told the jury how the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, combined their actions on the night of her death.
According to Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had taken location information from his cell phones to show Tellis was with Chambers the night she died.
When the data showed Tellis that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers's when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors recalled Tellis' testimony that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "The defendant is lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy was Tellis saying he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The cell phone records show that they have known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone after Chambers's death.
Hale said, “He wiped her out of his life.”
The defendant's closing defenses are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
This hip hop trio wants to change the genre’s negative perception by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based The High Breed claims that hip hop is moving away from the origins of political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently become popular again in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?
New York nanny sues couple she works with for "racist" message
A New York nanny sues the boy for being discriminated against and fired from her job after a message written by her mother and accidentally sent to her that reads "another black man."
The couple denies racism and makes the case look like "money laundering."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, said she was upset when she learned that her new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman sent a message to her husband saying, "THAT'S MORE BLACK."
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
The New York Post reported that Plasco-Flaxman, after realizing his mistake, "disturbed" African American Miss Maurice, told her that the nanny had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Ms. Maurice was paid a day's pay, and then she was sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice is suing the couple for firing and demanding $350 a day for the six months he was hired and worked at home without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do such things," the woman told the Post on Friday.
The couple responds to claims that they are racists, stating that it makes sense to end Maurice's work because they fear they can't trust him after they offend him.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told The Post: “My wife sent him something she didn’t mean.
He's not racist.
“We are not racist,” he said.
“But would you, even by mistake, hand your children over to someone you’ve been rude to?
Your newborn baby?
Don't."
Plasco, who sees the case as an effort to "make money", adds that the baby was born just two months ago and his wife is in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you going to sue someone like that?”
“That’s not very nice,” the investment expert adds.
The legal process is still ongoing, but the public is being hit on social media due to their dual behavior and logic.
A new letter shows Paddington publishers fear readers may not be able to relate to a talking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads for the first time before it's published.
It’s fun to see what we know now about Paddington’s great success.”
Jankel said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children’s book from the mouth of a little teddy bear, was optimistic about the possibility of rejection of his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books after his father’s death last year was “both bitter and sweet.”
He described Paddington as a "very important member of our family" and said his father was silently proud of the success he had at the end of the book.
"My father was a very quiet man, and he was not a man who boasted of what he did," he said.
"But since Paddington is so real to him, you feel as if you have a child who has accomplished something. Even if it's not your success, you're proud of it.
I think that's how my father assessed Paddington's success.
Although it was the product of his invention and his imagination, he always gave Paddington his due.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, and doctors tried to save her life but were unsuccessful.
"Nad called me regularly and told me that she was really bad and that she wasn't expected to live," she said.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying he was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey."
"We'll be back together soon."
I'll be with you.
Medications that doctors gave her heart to keep pumping blood slowly lost its effect and left her body.
He had been dead for a while and now it was over.
I knew what was going to happen and I just had to sit and wait.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry because I was in a place full of family members and a lot of people.
I really had to hold myself.”
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is now mourning her daughter, finally boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficulties she was going to face.
“No one knew,” he said.
"I lowered my head and tears flowed from my eyes.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a great deal of sympathy for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved him.”
Women who have lost loved ones are sticking cards to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been sticking cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers of people who can be contacted for support.
Ms. Davis's son Tyler struggled with depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," Davis says.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son is a promising cook who makes everyone around her smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They say his smile brings joy."
But before his death, he quit his job because he was in a "very bad time."
The first person to notice that Tyler killed himself in 2014 was his 11-year-old brother.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that the chain will have an effect."
She says Ms. Davis's reason for making the cards is to "make people realize that there are people you can always talk to, even if it's a friend."
“Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davis's for many years, lost her husband Mark for 15 years shortly after her mother's death.
"He never told me he was unhappy or depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day was extremely bad, and when the kids opened their gift packages, they didn’t even make eye contact with them.”
He said his wife’s death was a major trauma to the whole family, but they had to get through it: “It’s making a hole in the family’s heart.
He's tearing us apart.
We have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's fate will be determined by FBI investigation
"I think we could have reached an agreement if an investigation had been carried out on a limited scale and in a timely manner as he wished," Mr Flake said Saturday, fearing that the committee would "split up" into a stalemate due to partisanship.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The reason for all these reluctances is timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans do as badly as expected on November 6th, their efforts to get whoever they want elected to the country’s highest court will be severely damaged.
For some time, George W. Bush has been lobbying for Senators to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who in the past worked for him at the White House, to meet his current personal secretary, Ashley.
What happens after the FBI report is prepared?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently in the Senate.
It's unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach 50 votes in the Senate, but if he can, Vice President Mike Pence could break the tie and take him to the Supreme Court.
The number of people fleeing North Korea under Kim’s administration has fallen.
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of people fleeing North Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing information from the South's merger ministry, said the number of asylum seekers dropped from 2,706 in 2011 to 1,127 last year.
Mr Park said tightened border controls between North Korea and China were the most important factors for human traffickers to charge higher wages.
Pyongyang did not make any statements.
The vast majority of asylum seekers fleeing the North are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many of these people are fleeing the country through China, which has the longest borders with North Korea, enabling a much easier transition from the heavily protected Disarmament Zone (SB) between the two Koreas.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees, mostly returning them to their countries of origin.
The relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have made great progress in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the pending nuclear disarmament.
This meeting took place after US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un agreed in June to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the U.S. for not making enough progress on the sanctions since.
"If we can't trust the United States, we can't risk our national security, and under these circumstances we can't be the first to unilaterally disarm," Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not eligible to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not neurologically fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this statement in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't ignore the fact that if a woman did the same thing, people would call her 'hysterical'," Pelosi said in a statement Thursday before Kavanaugh's Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh rebuffed his allegations of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was quite emotional, talking about his family and high school years, almost screaming at times and sometimes unable to speak.
He also publicly condemned the Democrats on the committee, citing the charges against him as a “disgusting and planned character assassination” organized by liberals who were outraged at Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony was evidence that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think with these statements and his attitude toward the Clintons and the Democrats, he is demonstrating his own inadequacy,” he said.
Kavanaugh was elected and the Democrats hesitated to answer Pelosi, who was asked if he would appeal to the Supreme Court if he secured a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll tell you this; if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not even appropriate to be in the court he's currently in, except to serve in the Supreme Court," he said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that Kavanaugh is concerned as a Democrat as he is seen as a conservative judge about the potential provisions he will make against the Economic Health Care Act or Roe v. Wade.
During the admissions hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would change certain Supreme Court decisions.
“A hysterical, biased person should not expect us to go to court and say, ‘Isn’t that great?’”
Women should use it.
True criticism, even the months and years of rage, cannot be expressed without crying.
45 years later, Miss Steinem told me, "We cry when we're angry."
“This is not a rare thing, is it?”
He went on to say, "Somewhere a woman who was a manager helped me a lot, and she cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sorry that I cried with this technique.
I'm angry," he said.
And then it goes on.
I think that's very clever."
Tears, in part due to misunderstanding on the basis, appear as an expression of anger.
I remember one of my first jobs very well; I was crying in an office with a majority of men, with an incredibly angry, older woman, a cold manager I had always been a little afraid of, clinging to my neck and pulling me into a staircase.
"Never let them see you cry," he said.
"They won't know you're angry.
They’ll be happy to think you’re sorry because they think they can influence you.”
Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, a Democratic congresswoman at the time, worked with him during Gary Hart's presidential campaign.
When Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called the Monkey Business in 1987 and pulled out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was extremely perplexed, realized that there was no obstacle to her discovering the idea of running for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he says, laughing at me 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
'The Cotton Princess and the Seven Dwarves,' said one.
As his campaign started late, he was left behind in finding funds and vowed not to enter the race until he had raised $2 million.
It was a lost war.
He noticed that some of his supporters who gave him $1000 only gave him $250.
"Do they think I'm being discounted?" he wondered.
In a speech he announced that he would not launch an official campaign, his gratitude for the people who supported him, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult to find money and target voters instead of delegates, and the anger of sexism, he was so overwhelmed that his throat was knotted.
“You would think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled the reaction of the press to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write about carrying a grave.
“Were they crying?”
How can the US-China trade war benefit Beijing?
The first shots of the trade war between the U.S. and China were very violent, far from ending the war, but the gap between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by introducing additional tariffs on China’s most important export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most notable tension this week was the introduction of additional tariffs on some products worth a total of $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), in other words, taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing responded more politely each time, raising the five percent tariffs on U.S. goods worth $60 billion on the last time.
China has pledged to retaliate with the same power to the United States, and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will give up soon.
Making Washington step back requires the fulfillment of demands, but it would be too embarrassing for China’s President Xi Jinping to openly submit to the United States.
However, experts say that if China plays its cards correctly, it could be positively affected in the long term by the pressures of the trade war with the United States, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
Abigail Grace, a researcher at a think tank at the New American Security Center, said: “The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would cause economic turmoil in one of the two countries is far more dangerous than the people who follow the developments previously thought.”
"Syria is 'ready' for the return of asylum seekers"
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country has improved.
"Thanks to the fight against terrorism, the ground is now more solid and our lands are safer," he said.
The government is continuing its rehabilitation process to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
Unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods, and due to terrorism, there are all the conditions for migrants to voluntarily return to the countries where they have been forced to leave.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country as a result of the war that began in 2011.
Of the people still living in the country, six million are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime was open to future aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he underlined that they would not accept conditional aid and aid from rebel-sponsored countries.
Europe embraces the Ryder Cup win in Paris
With 16.5 against 10.5, the European Team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US Team at Le Golf National outside of France.
The U.S. suffered its sixth consecutive defeat in Europe and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
With Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team getting the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States, Europe regained the crown.
For most of the tournament, US star Phil Mickelson hit the water in the 16th hole, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players to progress 5-0-0 from the start of the current format of the tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5<0x26>4 by the Danish Thorbjorn Olessen, the lowest-ranked player in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, won 2-1 against British Ian Poulter, who is unlikely to ever compete in the Ryder Cup again.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has competed in the Ryder Cup eight times, is the highest-paid player of all time in Europe with a career score of 25.5.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stand it today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to have the trophy back.
It’s something about this team and I’m very happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
The torch is handed over to American golf legend Tiger Woods to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated 2<0x26>1 in Sunday's singles games.
“I’m incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, whom I grew up watching,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3-point history in the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for someone who came first after Jack Nicklaus with 14 major championships and one of the greatest players of all time.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament, the entire U.S. team struggled to find a free pass throughout the weekend.
After a disappointing performance for his team, US captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
We destroyed Europe this morning.
We fought.
I take off my hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Each of the 12 players played very well.
We’ll regroup, work with the PGA and Ryder Cup Committee in America, and we’ll keep moving forward.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their captain.
You need to take off the hat.
They played better than us.”
Red Tide News: Groups in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota are shrinking
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general reduction in Red Tide groups in some parts of the Tampa Bay area.
Inappropriate reproduction conditions are reported from the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier regions, according to the FWC, which explains the shrinking groups.
During a period of reproduction, the Red Tide expands 130 miles from North Pinellas to the South Lee region.
Smaller groups can be found within 10 miles of the Hillsborough District, but fewer than last week.
The red tide has also been observed in the Pasco region.
Last week, medium-sized groups were observed offshore and offshore in the Pinellas Region, small and large groups outside the Hillsborough Region, certain ambiguous and large groups in the Manatee Region, certain ambiguous and large groups on the coast and outshore in the Sarasota Region, certain ambiguous and medium-sized groups in the Charlotte Region, certain ambiguous and large groups in the Collier and small outshore of the Lee Region.
Respiratory disorders continue to be reported from the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier regions.
