Last minute: Our Cosmic Visitor Giant Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are perhaps billions of more giant asteroids in the Solar System that roam around and have serious consequences when it hits.
The path of these objects, which may have closed or open orbits from the formation of the Sun, sometimes passes through the Earth.
The 650-metre-diameter asteroid 2014 JO25 is also a visitor, and will pass at 14:24 a.m. today at a distance of 1.75 million kilometers, the closest location to Earth.
We hear this kind of news more and more every day.
The most important reason for this is the improvements in observational techniques and observational instruments.
This allows us to identify smaller asteroids that have not been previously identified.
Last January, for example, an asteroid the size of a bus passed at a distance of only half (<0x7E>250,000 km) from Earth and the Moon.
And what's even more interesting is that the asteroid was detected just a few days before the transition.
So there might be other cosmic buses coming at us right now.
What would you do if you heard that an asteroid 20 meters in diameter would fall right in the middle of your neighborhood?
In fact, asteroids of this size won't destroy your neighborhood, but it's likely that every building's window will explode.
This will be due to shock waves emitted by the asteroid that will explode in the atmosphere.
In 2013, for example, the asteroid that crashed into Russia was of this size, enough to tear down the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you have a neighborhood in the target of a 100-metre-wide asteroid, my advice to you is to go at least 50 kilometers from your neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of impact are factors that determine the depth of the crater to be formed and the damage to be caused by the impact.
Let's take a look at a few scenarios according to the simulation of the European Space Agency.
If an asteroid with a diameter of 100 m hits the Earth at a 45-degree angle at a speed of 60 km per second, it will form a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a diameter of 1,200 meters.
The impact is equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 6 on the Richter scale, and a third degree burn occurs in your body even if you are 10 km away from the impact point.
Those 50 miles away will be waiting for the broken windows.
If an asteroid hits a mile in diameter, it's even more depressing.
If such an asteroid hits Earth at the same angle and speed, it will form a crater about 600 meters deep and 12 km in diameter.
So a whole neighborhood becomes a crater and disappears instantly.
Even if you are 100 km away from the impact point because of the heat generated by the impact, a third degree burn occurs in your body.
The impact is equivalent to an 8-inch earthquake on the Richter scale.
The damage to the asteroid depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rock structure of the area it will hit.
The above values are based on the scenario that occurs when a hard rock-like asteroid falls into a sedimentary rock region.
If the asteroid is mostly made of iron, if it falls on a surface formed by the cooling of the lava, the size of the crater will increase by three times and the resulting disaster will be tolerated.
66 million years ago, something even worse happened to the dinosaurs and they were hit by an asteroid within a 10-kilometer radius.
The asteroid impact killed 75 percent of sea and land life.
If such a massive asteroid destroying the dinosaurs targets Earth, the most robust option would be to leave the planet.
Every day, tons of matter drops from space into Earth.
Most of it burns in the atmosphere.
Some large enough meteorites burn in the atmosphere, causing flashes known as stellar shifts among the population.
Let’s end our article with another comforting story.
Studies show that a giant asteroid is not expected to hit Earth for the next 300-400 years, which will cause serious destruction.
I'm sure, as an average of 70 years old, you're a little relieved.
Medel claims flash: 10 million euros!
The name on the agenda of the Black-White who want to reinforce the stop zone is Gary Medel, whose departure from Inter is seen as certain.
The 30-year-old footballer, who went on holiday after playing for the Confederations Cup in Chile and recently resumed his work with Inter, is waiting for future offers.
The prestigious Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport has suggested that Besiktas has made an offer of 10 million euros to Inter for Medel, who can serve in both the stopper and the preliminary zone.
The Black-White people who presented their offer to Medel were said to expect a response from both sides, while the Chilean footballer was said to be keen to live with his family in Istanbul.
Despite Gazzetta’s claim, the Black Eagle, which has an FFP limitation, is quite difficult to pay a price of 10 million euros for Medel.
There is a possibility that the black-and-whites will go to Medel by leasing, as in the first Caner Erkin transfer, or in the event of a serious discount in their booking, the star player will be added to the squad.

Human rights group issued travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning for colored people who will travel to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement reads: “The Missouri state NAACP Travel Advice Statement, effective from August 28, 2017, advises African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention and extreme caution when traveling from top to bottom of the state, as stated there, as the recent statewide skeptical, racial-based incidents are occurring.”
The NAACP said a new Missouri law makes it difficult for people to win discrimination lawsuits, while the state’s law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities was effective in the group’s release of this travel warning.
“There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped, beaten and killed because of the color of their skin," Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, told the Kansan City Star.
“We hear complaints that we’ve never heard before.”
This is the first time the association has issued such a warning for a state in the United States.
The group cited racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the deaths of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders passed through the state earlier this year after running out of fuel and was arrested by Missouri police without charge of a crime and died under suspicious circumstances.
The recommendation also draws attention to a new report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is for people to stay awake and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People should be ready to bring bail money with them, to inform their relatives that they're going through this state."
In Missouri, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crimes reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes committed in 2015, placing the state 16th in the country in terms of the number of similar violations.
A travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for a business to sue for discrimination while renting a home or giving a job.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona after local executive authorities of these states passed immigration enforcement laws that ordered people to be arrested for immigration violations; ACLU says this would increase practices by race.
Travel alerts are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently defense groups have resorted to this practice in response to a number of laws and trends within the United States.
Demba Ba in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>
Two seasons ago, Demba Ba, who was transferred to Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros, returned to Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> for free.
Black Eagle, who asked for a detailed health report from the Senegal player last week, took action following the report from the star footballer.
The black-and-white management, which began work for the 32-year-old player, whom the Chinese representative did not consider in the squad next season, knocked on the door of the Shanghai team.
Not listed
Demba Ba, who was not listed because of his foreign status in China, said he wanted to return to the Black and White people.
The Chinese team has confirmed the departure of the 32-year-old player.
The Senegalese footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days to sign the official contract.
Castillo was operated in Trabzonspor
According to the statement on the website of the Bordeaux-blue club, Castillo has undergone an arthroscopic meniscus operation from his left knee at Liv Hospital in Istanbul, "After the operation performed by Prof. Dr. U<0xC4><0x9F>ur Hakarlar, our player is expected to start training with the team within 4 weeks".
Castillo was injured on the right back in a preparatory match of the Bordeaux-blue team against the Dutch team Heerenveen at the Slovak camp.
The Colombian player, who was told that he would be away from the field for 3-4 weeks due to his treatment, was also scheduled to undergo surgery due to his previous meniscus problem.
A referendum on Barzan!
Barzani gave a speech at a commemoration ceremony in Duhok on the occasion of the third anniversary of the terrorist organization Daesh's attack on the Yazidi in Mosul's Sinjar district.
Referring to the independence referendum the IKBY wanted to hold on September 25, Barzani said: "I regret to state that we have no hope that Iraq will be a proper and proper country."
“We have tried all roads with Iraq, but we are completely helpless and desperate.
Our past experiences with Iraq have brought us to this situation, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to take our rights and protect them.
Therefore, in order to ensure life and security together, we must show the world that we can all determine our destiny through a referendum.
I must underline that the referendum is not a goal for us, but a means for us to achieve a greater goal.
Recalling that the Iraqi central government made many promises to the Kurds after the fall of the Ba'ath Regime in 2003, Barzani said that the disaster in Sinjar soon occurred and that a direct referendum was taken following the fight against Daesh.
Barzani said he wanted to determine his fate peacefully and democratically for the self-preservation and development of the IKBY people: "It has come to light with documents that Iraq cannot or does not want to protect us like a state."
"He doesn't want us to move forward," he defended.
Barzani said that the Iraqi central government did not give them weapons during the fight against Daesh, but reacted to the fact that Hashdi Shabi, which was established with a fatwa in a short period of time, was immediately legalized and all weapons were supplied:
Peshmerga, within Iraq's defense system, was not addressed.
The central government did not give Peshmerga what it offered to Hashdi Shabi.
Peshmerga is considered to be part of Iraq's defense system, according to the constitution.
However, while Hashdi Shabi did not have a presence in the constitution, all the possibilities were mobilized by breaking the laws.
We're not saying we're against Hashdi Shabi.
Peshmerga and Hashdi Shabi fought on the same front, so why is the existence of Peshmerga and its fight against terrorism being covered up while Hashdi Shabi is being legalized on the one hand?
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
On August 3, 2014, ISIS launched an attack on the Yazidis living in Sinjar district of Mosul, killing many people, including women and children.
He returned from the crash in 10 minutes.
According to the BBC, the Boeing 777 aircraft of Air France was in the west of Hokkaido, north of Japan, when the North Korean missile was in the air.
The missile crashed into the area where the plane was located 10 minutes ago, officials said, adding that the missile was estimated to be about 100-150 kilometers away from the plane.
According to Air France, the missile did not intersect with the aircraft’s route and there were no problems with the flight.
"The information we have at this stage indicates that the missile fell into the sea more than 100 kilometers away from the aircraft's route," the statement said.
Nothing is sacred?
Trump’s White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most obvious sign of regime change is that they start attacking statues.
The Americans know as much about this as anyone else; as a matter of fact, the meticulously plotted overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003...
One of the key theorists of the Trump regime, Stephen Miller, with CNN’s Jim Acosta, certainly knew what the president was doing in a heated debate over proposals to severely restrict legal immigration, while symbolically destroying the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
If he did, he'd be lynched by a bunch of boat owners and Liberty imitators.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed, when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to the memorial base.
Miller told Acosta: “I don’t want to talk about history from beginning to end here, but the Statue of Liberty ... is a symbol of American freedom to the world.
The poem you mentioned was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller is right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This relates to the contemporary echo of Lazarus’ frightening words, in which a state seems to invite not only some elderly migrants but also the poor of the poor: “The tired, poor, the crowded masses long for the breath of freedom, the wretched desire of the crowded land.”
There's never been a time when "feeling unwanted" was so visible on our screens.
Miller did not bring literary criticism; he explained that these people were not welcome in Trump’s United States.
The conflict over the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it’s actually a conflict over the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his friends, who campaigned after his death to put his words on the base of the statue, knew very well that they were engaged in a political act.
The statue intended to celebrate the connections between French and American republicanism in a stereotypical metaphorical way, representing the advent of Liberty in the form of women.
Lazarus changed this meaning: the female figure in his poem was no longer abstract, but had a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
His marriage to the image of poetry is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American anti-immigrant sentiment.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the rightists have long wanted to change it back.
Rush Limbaugh, a big-name Baptist John bullshit for Trump’s arrival, argued in 2010 that Freedom didn’t invite anyone in, but rather an early-era neocon who kept American fires in the dark world: “Mrs. Freedom stands out.
He has to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to illuminate the way to the United States.”
Unusually, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The meaning of the statue was all about the angle of perception.
Lazarus’s magnificent creative act was to see it as seen by people who were exhausted, miserable, but hopeful on board the ships after long and often terrible journeys.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for shelter and improving their lives.
His statue responded to them with words of hope and the warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump would in any way justify.
Their torch is not to guide, but to excite hatred, their only source of strength.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when only two Scots could enter the Great Britain team
Neil Black, the UK’s Athletics performance director, says the 16-member Scottish team will make a “massive contribution” to the team.
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which began on Friday.
Black believes that "something is developing" in Scotland and that UK athletics should learn from it.
"We're adopting this and we're trying to figure it out, and we're going to work until we get out of it," Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it’s about what they’re doing.
Scottish Athletics thinks it's about what they do.
British athleticism: He thinks it has to do with what they do.
The guy on the street in the corner, too.
Whatever the combination of the conditions, it’s absolutely wonderful.”
Many Scottish athletes, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at 5,000 m, compete for medals, while Eiilidh Doyle was selected as captain by the squad.
"Elidh is a little modest.
The captain's speech was incredible," Black said.
“Whether it’s Scottish or wherever they live or practice, a few athletes have come out of that room very proud and really motivated.
Eilidh’s natural passion and true feeling was amazing.”
A silver medalist from the Commonwealth of Nations, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at the fifth World Championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland’s top total athlete figure at previous world championships was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Muir is the leader of five British and two European records-breaking mid-range runners last year.
Participate in 1500 m and 5000 m.
Chris O'Hare, who has had a very good season, including British Team trials and triumphs at the Anniversary Games, is another Scottish to watch.
Doyle remembers his first championship where the only other Scottish player on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain said he was "very proud" of the move, as many of his compatriots would not only join the team, but would in some cases compete for the medals and fight to stay in the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that it’s been with the votes of other members of the team, so it’s been a great honor, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you made it special for me.”
“Honestly, I’m proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
This shows how far we have come.
And they're here as proven athletes, as athletes who look forward to getting on the podium.
As for the captain's speech?
Yeah, I think it went well.
I took advantage of the fact that we are very lucky in this situation, in the sense that we have a World Championship at home.
So, in reality, it's just the impact of being able to take advantage of this internal support and the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium that we're successful.
I get a second chance to get out there and fight, and there’s going to be a great atmosphere there.”
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Candidates for state office if you can’t handle voters’ criticism
Our country's father had some knowledge of negative press coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him harshly on everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was upset by the criticism.
But his critics did not silence him.
In 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be abolished, and we can be fooled and silently dragged to the slaughter.”
That brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work harder to be like Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people who shared their views on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor’s staff didn’t care about the case because it was serious, and the online comments were full of “who cares?” reactions.
A lot of people said, “It’s just Facebook.”
But it's important.
This is especially important when you're like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor who is surprisingly popular in a state that is overwhelmingly Democratic.
It has the second highest approval rate among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan's not a reactionary mad flare.
He excelled in leading his state and in strict adherence to principles.
With his prankful introduction of his hairless head after chemotherapy, he was also quite capable of using Facebook as the primary tool to connect with his constituents.
So blocking people who come to the governor’s page, which is a public forum, which is formally characterized, and which is run by staff members who pay public tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was more than just arranging them.
But it’s easy to use images of trolls or spammers or hateful people making online verbal attacks.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people who speak only to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a business owner, and a priest; not a troll.
They all said his comments were not respectful, thoughtful, and abusive.
The priest made a quote from the Bible, addressing Hogan's Catholic faith in his sharing.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a lawyer from Bowie, Maryland, was not filled with hate, but asked about hate crimes.
In the comment section of The Post's news, he wrote, "I kindly commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes and other recent news."
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, some people immediately ignore it as a supposed collective effort rather than a large group of concerned citizens.”
What the governor’s staff calls a “intensified spam attack” others will likely call “idea advocacy.”
The Facebook era makes it easier for a message to be readily accessible through blocking an opponent or deleting a negative message.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when staff were sent out to gather and burn newspapers with critical articles, or when protesters had to be arrested and silenced.
But, digitally, that's exactly what's happening.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for disabling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked on Twitter.
One of the decisions that could be a reference to this issue in the future came from Virginia last week.
The chairmanship of the Loudoun Administrative District Supervisory Board went against the First Amendment when it banned a voter on Facebook, according to James C. Cacheris, U.S. District Judge in Alexandria.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was also visited by ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the age of reasonably priced mail had a very similar effect to that of the internet.
Between 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and unknown letter writers eroded his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unnamed trolls.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to the newspapers that undermined Washington's decisions.
According to the online George Washington Papers Project, which collects historical documents, petitions criticizing his stance on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation with Britain have overwhelmed his office.
But it didn't silence them.
Freedom of expression, of opposition and of comparison is at the core of our nation.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes he will be comfortable at Renaissance Club
Ronan Rafferty, a former number one in Europe, hopes that over the next three days, the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be in the comfort of his home while hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
Leading the next door to Paul Eales at Archerfield Links before losing, the Northern Irishman is committed to the new venue and acts as an ambassador for the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said: “I’ve watched the Renaissance Club build and we’re seeing its glory with this organization.
Players will see the field in its best form, in a spectacular state.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He is an unwavering defender of this game and is proud of his success here.
This is a great show for this field.”
Despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour, the British Eales will fight to maintain a championship for the first time in their 32-year career.
The Southport-based actor said, “It feels really special.”
“I didn’t have a chance to defend the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the calendar the year after I won.
It's nice to be back in this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year come alive, and last year was very special for me and my wife Sharon to win.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it with love.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 at the beginning of this year, is also returning to his field.
This will be the first Scottish competition since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
Helensburgh man Orr said, "It always makes a little more sense when you fight inside."
“You want to do well, but you also feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again and really enjoyed playing golf.
I’m happy to go so far.”
Former Masters champions Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation is free and parking is available; <0xC2><0xA3>5 per car with one person and <0xC2><0xA3>10 per car with two or more people.

I found the answer
Think of a "seat"... Its budget is more than the budget allocated to each of the eleven ministries, including the Ministries of Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism, with 6 billion 867 million Turkish Liras!
The number of employees is 117,378.
Turkey’s largest “propaganda base”
Yes, I'm talking about the Presidency of Religious Affairs!
Yes, I will talk about the President of Religious Affairs Mehmet Görmez!
For days, I've been looking for an answer to my question...
I wonder why Mehmet Görmez was taken from his seat...
I've read every article that came out about his submission.
I don't.
I can't find the answer to the question I'm looking for.
At the beginning of this year...
Mehmet Görmez prepared the 2017-2021 Strategic Plan of the Presidency of Religious Affairs.
The 1 million lira S 600 model Mercedes was pulled under by President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
There was no problem with Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
So what happened?
You might say, "Isn't it enough that he served seven years?"
The first President of the D<0xC4><0xB0>B, M.R<0xC4><0xB1>fat Burekçi, served for 17 years.
Mehmet Nuri Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, as you all know, sat in that chair for 11 years.
So... the president's term is open.
My question is, why did he leave his seat?
It's over.
Proximity to Shia
A source close to the government said: “According to the traditional ulame, the people of Mehmet Dönmez did not have the sunnah!”
The code for this sentence is: it does not have the Sunnah!
The person who uttered this phrase then blurted out: - "It was found modernist by the traditional ulema!"
I mean, Mehmet Görmez was innovative.
What does innovation mean?
The answer to the question was hidden in Mehmet Görmez's trip abroad.
Date: December 27, 2015.
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to attend the 29th Wahdet Conference in Tehran, which aims to bring the Islamic sects closer together.
He met with Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
So he prayed with his disciples.
And at the conference, he said, "Sects are human schools that have been formed over time, representing different ideas and convictions in the understanding of the religion of Islam."
All of them are determined by the will of God.
Each one of them is on the same path as the other, but the path is the same.
It is never acceptable to equate religion with religion or to see its sectarianity above the Islamic one.
Segregation based on sectarianism is a reflection of dissension and conflict and ignorance.
It is the religion itself that has suffered the most when the sects preceded the religion...
Here I would like to emphasize again by highlighting:
Sunnis and Shiites are one nation.
“No one can takfir another because he perceives Islam as he understands it.”
A year later...
Only Jafari leader Selahattin <0xC3><0x96>zgünz from Turkey attended the 30th Vahdet Meeting.
I mean...
Not Sunni, but Wahhabism
Mehmet Görmez's visit to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of "traditional ulama".
The next Tehran conference, representing the Turkish state – again – was that no one attended.
Mehmet did not see the invitation four times since he took office.
The reason was obvious: the Shiite-Iranian anti-Iranian "traditional ulema!"
Immediately after the visit to Iran, starting from the beginning of 2016, Mehmet Görmez's seat began to be worn out.
At the beginning of this there was Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmu<0xC5><0x9F> in charge of the D<0xC4><0xB0>B!
Mehmet Görmez was so drowning that he wanted to "connect with the D<0xC4><0xB0>B President".
It's basically...
There was a difference in the view of the Sunni within the state.
The "traditional ulema", as if the theoretical worlds were created in Saudi Arabia and Egyptian madrasas, was equating Sunniism – in the US shadow – with Wahhabi-Salafism!
These were anti-Iranians who could not tolerate even a trip to Tehran.
It was not surprising that <0xC3><0x87>übbeli Ahmet’s words about Mehmet Görmez were not surprising: “Dyanet did not find anything more dangerous than this.”
“My Lord, grant to thee, O my Lord, that thou mayest be a righteous man, and a good man, and a good man.”
They used the word "hahlisunnet" as a symbol of Iranian hostility.
The anti-Iranian anti-CIA-supported anti-Iranian movement that was once the FET<0xC3><0x96> was now carrying out new names.
And with the FET<0xC3><0x96> traps...
A photo of a young man with whiskey was served to the media with the lie "Son of Mehmet Görmez"!
What a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Görmez in the media: Turkey, the newspaper of the U.S.-led I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>kç<0xC4><0xB1>lar Jamaat<0xC4><0xB1>!
After all...
- Who refuses to bring the Sunni into the line of the Saudi Wahhabi-Salaf...
- Who doesn't inflame sectarian...
A clergyman, whose consciousness was destroyed by a "traditional ulema" created during the Cold War...
U.S. cultural imperialism continues to rapidly Arabize Turkey (making Wahhabi-Selefi).
Do not doubt that the Head of the Future Religious Affairs will be the Wahhabi-Salefi representative!
“We support the preservation of Turkey’s sovereignty.
Foreign Minister Mevlüt <0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu went to China for an official visit.
<0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a joint press conference at the State Guest House in Beijing.
"We hope that Turkey will be more actively involved in international issues," Wang said.
China will support Turkey in its efforts to preserve its sovereignty, stability and security.
"We hope that the Palestinian issue will be resolved with the international community, including Turkey," he said.
<0xC3><0x87>avu<0xC5><0x9F>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu said that "Turkey seeks close cooperation with regional and international organizations, international organizations are not an alternative to each other, but complementary."
Spiritually begins his second term
Hassan Rouhani's presidency, which won the presidential election in May in Iran, was approved by the country's leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Hassan Rouhani, who was elected president for the second time in Iran, was sworn in at a ceremony attended by the country's religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The ceremony, attended by senior military and political figures as well as representatives of foreign countries, was attended by Reza Hakan Tekin, Turkey's Ambassador to Tehran on behalf of Turkey.
Rouhani, who will serve as president for another four years, will officially take office on Saturday (August 5th) following the swearing-in ceremony in parliament.
The ceremony is expected to be attended by Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekçi representing Turkey.

According to the information received, the Babel Air Border Gate, located near the Turkish border, and the Cilvega<0xC5><0x9F>e<0xC5><0x9F> Border Gate, due to the negative security conditions in the region, were closed to transports other than humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning agents.
Help trucks are allowed to exit the Cilvega<0xC5><0x9F>e<0xC5><0x9F> Border Gate.
It is not known how long the restriction will last.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove when she cooks.
He rarely even uses a bowl.
The housewife puts a sweet potato, commonly known locally as a "note", directly on the fire in her wooden house in Enarotali, Paniai regency, in the restless region of Papua, Indonesia.
After half an hour, the roasted lump is removed and wiped with appetite, hands are not washed.
Degei sits on the muddy floor where he does chores like laundry with fuzzy water from the nearby swamp, with no furniture.
It's like a bucket of desert toilets in a house without a roof.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned to any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, many are drinking too much, and there are soldiers.
"Nobody walks around the village after 5:00 p.m.," he says.
A rare snapshot of everyday life in the mountainous areas of Papua, a former Dutch colony absorbed by Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum in which only 1026 seniors were forced to vote by force before the troops invaded.
A current movement that is propagandizing independence against the Dutch administration has quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains strict control over the region and bans foreign journalists or rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the region was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, as independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as isolated as it is remote; the journey here includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital Jayapura to Nabire and a 5-hour stomach-wrenching car ride with a rental car.
No public transport.
The 19,000-seat resort contains wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with wrinkled iron roofs turned into various shades of yellowish brown by rust.
Let's leave the journalists, very few Indonesians have traveled here, and almost no foreigner has ever traveled here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," Degei said, referring to his vibrant, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and shiny skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, with the worst child deaths and literacy rates in Asia.
But at the same time, this is Indonesia's golden land.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, Grasberg is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a mountainous region the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion in lumber reserves.
However, these riches, which are a source of misery for the Papuans, allow the powerful army of Indonesia to maintain a suffocating presence.
The New York Times’ 2005 research reports that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 paid to a single officer.
The more autonomy of the Papuans threatens this golden egg-laying hen and is being mercilessly deprived of its rights.
Since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
Mass killings in the 1970s in the mountainous parts of Papua reached the figures of genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators in the region last year alone.
The Brisbane Archdiocese’s “We’ll Lose Everything” report in 2016 contains testimony of misdemeanors such as unlawful executions, torture (especially popular with rape and electricity, according to another report), and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because there are incidents every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The pressure increased as Papua's resources brought settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the region's 3.5 million population is Christian, but the demographics change as Muslim migrants from Indonesia's densely populated islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi come for economic purposes.
Java warung buffets sell gado-gado served with peanut sauce mixed with fried chicken and vegetables.
The locals are struggling to compete.
"Immigrants sell chicken and vegetables in traditional markets cheaper than native Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old native of Paniai, who moved for business to the regional capital Jayapura.
"This caused the native Papuans to lose their Papuan mama-mama (females) to the market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, more commonly known as Jokowi, promised to resolve the inequalities and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
As the former carpenter headed for the presidential palace in Jakarta, 27 of Papua’s 29 districts, including Panaia, received votes.
But very little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 in hopes that he would realize our hope of justice being restored,” You said.
In fact, Paniai experienced his worst state only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children outside singing Christmas songs in front of a fire in Enarotali broke through two Indonesian military darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers resented his style, and according to local priest Yavedt Thebai, he later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses said the soldiers who had been drinking chased the group and beat them with their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at the group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby government election commission building was set on fire, and the following day the events escalated.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua (running in the form of a ring and imitating the singing of birds).
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and the military garrison.
As the nerves grew more tense, an order was sent to the soldiers via internal radio: "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot and kill them." An official document seen by TIME, which was not disclosed to the local media, said.
Jeremias Kayame (56), head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the imminent danger and prayed to the crowd to return home, demanding calm.
No one was willing to listen.
On the porch of his brightly painted wooden house, he told TIME, "When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist."
Kayame still doesn’t know who fired, but says the bullet came from the collected military era.
"It was crowded, shot many times," he added.
According to his cousin, who witnessed the attacks, native Alfius Youw was shot three times.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, known by only one name, told TIME pessimistly.
"I saw you die... I kissed her."
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only "secured" the police station because the police station was under attack.
"When people threaten to kill us, we have to defend ourselves," said Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistio in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the deaths reached Jakarta only the next day.
Jokowi gave an enthusiastic speech three weeks later in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the victims' families and promising to resolve the historical abuses in Papua.
"I want this case resolved immediately so it won't happen again in the future."
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he had set up a non-forensic mechanism for historical human rights violations.
The excuses began almost immediately.
"Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some in the 90s and some in the early 2000s.
The point is that we are determined to resolve these violations, but there are processes that we have to go through.”
Speaking to TIME on June 5, Wiranto stepped back, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It'll all be settled by the law."
Wiranto, whom the UN accused of "crimes against humanity" related to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, have already been resolved.
The families of the Paniai victims responded with bitter skepticism to such claims.
"I've been interviewed four times in the past three years, but no progress has been made," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
Years later, he says, he's still living in fear.
He says, "I'm scared."
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeats his view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by a soldier after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the corpses, the soldier came looking for me," he says.
The attacks haven't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers at Paniai's neighbor, the Deiyai regency.
During a clash between the villagers and the director of a construction company who refused to help a man who was not himself, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's construction site office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the officers and they reacted with a warning shot.
But locals say the moving brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd and killed someone.
Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives close to the hospital and witnessed the upbringing of the wounded, told TIME: "We were very panicked, we were afraid of revenge."
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officials involved to be held accountable and the moving police brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development nurtures the discontent of the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribal peoples who live scattered along Papua's green mountainous center.
Many joined the rebel army Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the rights of the Papuans by random attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily held by soldiers in recent years under the guise of "protecting national sovereignty".
Some are never seen again.
Among the peoples of Papua, Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
A little rice on sale at Enarotali is too expensive for the locals to buy.
Bread is inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly the note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women who can sustain four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, selling the rest in the local market.
Ten notes make only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between native Papuans and new immigrants have increased since the opening of new air routes to Nabire Airport.
Jobs that are already scarce often go to immigrants who are better educated and richer.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary qualifications to run their own business competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no work or money here," said John Gobai, president of the Panai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, the reporting restrictions for international media remain tightly in place.
Earlier this year, French journalist Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua due to "lack of coordination with relevant institutions" despite their rarely-given permission to shoot videos.
According to Phelim Kine, Assistant Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, Jokowi’s campaign promises of lifting the restrictions on newsmaking and development have not been fulfilled in order to increase its transparency.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to make news from the restless eastern end provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press supervision means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is mostly limited to its neighbors near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands) urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including Panaia attacks.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Arrmanata Nasir told reporters in Jakarta that "the democratic system in Indonesia is still in place and there are free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence in human rights cases."
Locals want more foreign governments to take care of them.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on May 4, headed by the country's human rights envoy, Kees Van Baar, the locals broke their silence in their plea "We want freedom," according to a source who attended the meeting and did not want to be named.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai attack," says tribal council president Gobai.
He wants Jokowi to know that, apart from living under the imminent threat of a tyrannical soldier, the Paniai people are rolling around with little education and health care and fakru necessity.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, see their vote as a “debt” to Jokowi to pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice.”
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out one last symbolic act of resistance: burying a victim’s body in the land opposite the police and military outpost.
Knowing that justice may never be done, they will at least make sure that those responsible do not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says, head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Tower' skyscraper for the second time
On Friday, a fire erupted in Dubai’s highest residential towers, forcing hundreds of residents to flee a 79-story 337-metre-long structure.
This is the second major fire that has spread rapidly to the high building, called the Torch Tower, in two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and no explanation was given for the cause of the fire.
“We were sleeping and waking up to the fire alarm, people were screaming.
We ran downstairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor," a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil defense authorities said the firefighters extinguished the fire around 4 a.m. local time and were refrigerant the building.
The government said it was trying to provide shelter for those affected.
This could raise questions about the safety of materials used in the exteriors of tall buildings around the world.
An investigation of the torch management following the fire in 2015 found that most of the damage was in the coating, i.e. in the outer panels used for decoration and insulation.
Police in the UK believe the isolation and coating panel system on London’s Grenfell Tower, where 80 people were killed, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June.
More than 4,000 chronic patients receive ‘social assistance’
The Ministry of Family and Social Policies will benefit 4,300 people with tuberculosis and SSPE in the first phase of the social assistance program for poor citizens and their families who are struggling with chronic diseases.
The Ministry, which plans to provide monthly support to patients over two-thirds of the minimum wage through the aid program, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information obtained, the details and the application principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases", which started some time ago under the direction of Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, Minister of Family and Social Policies, were revealed.
The social assistance program, launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health to support citizens struggling with chronic diseases and experiencing economic and psychological difficulties, is also a first in the world in many aspects.
Having completed all the necessary preparations for the launch of the program, the Ministry will provide not only cash but regular psychosocial support to families through the social assistance program.
Thus, poor citizens who have chronic disease and continue their treatment processes at home and their families are not left alone, both physically and spiritually.
According to the studies, in the first stage, poor citizens struggling with Subakut Sclerozan Panencephalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and measles, will receive regular psychosocial and cash support as part of the new social assistance program.
The program will include the assistance program for poor citizens struggling with other rare and risky diseases.
In addition to the support that is planned to be given at a rate above two-thirds of the minimum wage, tuberculosis patients whose medical self-care they are unable to cope with, who live dependent on the bed or who are determined by the relevant health unit to improve their home living conditions may also receive additional payment.
In order to benefit from the support, it is required that the monthly income per person in the household be less than two-thirds of the monthly net amount of the minimum wage.
In addition, citizens suffering from SSPE need to have a health board report issued in accordance with the procedures and principles specified in the "Regulation on Measures of Forgiveness, Classification and Health Board Reports to Disabled Persons".
According to the survey, more than 1 out of 5 U.S. passengers bring prohibited substances on board
According to a survey of airline passengers, more than 20 percent deliberately or unknowingly smuggled prohibited substances from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent carrying banned knives or other sharp objects without knowing it.
Less than 1% later claimed to have mistakenly spotted traveling with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
A study of more than 1,000 people conducted by Stratos Jet Charters found that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the participants who admitted to deliberately trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were from Generation Y, while fewer than 15 were from Generation X.
The most common substances intentionally abducted from TSA agents are food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to intentionally using sharp tools from security, while 2.2 percent of female participants and 3.7 percent of male participants also admitted to knowingly carrying banned drugs on board the plane.
The company said it surveyed passengers across the country to find out how many people from airport security accidentally brought smuggled goods and how many did so intentionally.
It is no surprise that the most likely people to pass illegal security goods on purpose or unknowingly are those who fly the most.
Still, as the firm notes, the TSA rules are a bit complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what fluids they can carry or how much of them they can carry.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of substance confiscated by the TSA has emerged as prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might be treating books as smuggled goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
China welcomes U.S. statements
At a press conference in Beijing, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that Tillerson’s administration “does not seek an excuse for regime change, the collapse of the regime, the rapid reunification of the peninsula and sending our troops north of the 38th parallel.”
China's Foreign Minister Wang said that Tillerson reaffirmed Washington's principles on the North Korean issue and hoped the United States would implement them effectively and in a concrete outcome-driven policy.
Noting that the security of the Korean peninsula is their priorities, Wang said that the parties expect to find a middle ground where they can resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, while the Beijing administration has long insisted on de-nuclearization of the peninsula, maintaining peace and stability, and resolving the problems through dialogue and negotiations.
EPA President Pruitt Stops Delaying Obama-era Emissions Reduction Laws
A day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the president of the Environmental Protection Organization, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era laws that lowered air pollutant emissions that caused dirty smoke.
Pruitt represented the change as his organization became more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than previous administrations.
He never mentioned the legal objection to his previous position in a federal Supreme Court.
The issue is that states are starting to meet October 1st, the end of 2015 standards for ground level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone compliance for one year to give his organization more time to work on the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Oklahoma’s state attorney general, had long served as a credible ally against more stringent environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly acted to block or delay regulations that are opposed to the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's abrupt change is Pruitt's latest legal defeat for his agenda to reverse the regulation.
Last month, a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA’s attempt to delay the implementation of an Obama administration law, which requires oil and gas firms to monitor and reduce methane leaks, exceeded the limits of their own authority.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that the reversal of the ozone standards only reinforces the EPA's commitment to meeting new standards on time with the states and working through complex processes.
Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job, said: "Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for decisions, waiting to be sued by activist groups and others, and agreed to settle the dispute to set the timings for the decision."
“We don’t believe in regulation through litigation, and we take term dates seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously.”
Still, the EPA’s statement said that Pruitt could once again use his “delay authority and all other legally available authority” at some point to ensure that the regulations are “supported by sound policies and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone laws.
A House bill approved last month seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 laws for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate to vote.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who leads the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: “The EPA’s decision-making after our trials is a significant achievement for the health and safety of more than 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the dirty smoke that flows into their communities.”
The case involved California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington and District of Columbia.
Ozone at ground level is produced when general pollutants are released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources reacting to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting dirty smoke can cause serious breathing problems in a group of people who are affected quickly and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists applauded Pruitt's surprise decision.
Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity said: “It’s uncomfortable that it takes so much pressure to get this discreet step from the person in charge of protecting the air we breathe.”
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration’s ideological struggle to flatter those who pollute the environment and interest groups.”
Single-digit inflation
Turkey, which achieved the largest increase in exports in 6 years in July, brought unemployment from 13% in January to 10.5 in April and the economic confidence index rose to the 3.5 year peak, also reduced inflation to a single household.
According to data released yesterday by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK), the Consumer Price Index (T<0xC3><0x9C>FE) rose 0.15 percent in July, and annual inflation fell to a single household for the first time since January with 9.79 percent.
As of July, the highest increase on a monthly basis was seen in restaurants and hotels, with 1.75 per cent, while the highest decline was in clothing and shoes, with 3.51 per cent.
The highest increase on an annual basis occurred in the transport group with 15.24 percent.
Business Investment Economist Muammer Kömürcüo<0xC4><0x9F>lu noted that in July, in parallel with expectations, inflation is falling to a single digit, "In the moderate course of inflation, there is the effect of the decline in prices of food and clothing groups."
But the core indicators, unlike the headline, have an elevation compared to the previous month.
"We do not expect a relaxation in the tight stance of the Central Bank," he said.
Despite the decline in headline inflation, there was an increase in core inflation indicators.
The B index, which is also closely monitored by the Central Bank, rose from 9.07% to 9.46% in July, while the C index rose from 9.20% to 9.60%.
Enver Erkan, the deputy director of Kapital FX Research, said that inflation could be closed at 9.3 percent of the year, "Inflation could fluctuate until December and fall to a single household in December."
"The Central Bank may have an opportunity in the first months of 2018," he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek: Inflation will close the year with a single digit.
The tightening of the central bank will continue until inflation is below 7%.
We will give the final shape to the reforms in the nearby Food Committee.
Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci: We are pleased that inflation has fallen to a single digit, but it has to become permanent.
In the fight against inflation, in addition to reducing the volatility of food prices, supply needs to be increased.
Minister of Development Lutfi Elvan: In the coming months, a slight upward trend in annual inflation may be seen due to the base effect, but from the first months of 2018, the decline in inflation will become apparent.
We expect the annual inflation to go even lower.
I wish Fenerbahçe success in the next match.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said their performance in the second half of the UEFA Europa League 3rd qualifying round with Fenerbahçe in a 1-1 draw was not enough to skip the round.
Speaking at a press conference after the match, Foda said that Fenerbahçe is a top-level team and said, "We were unable to use the wings in the first half."
In the second half, we played the game.
We had a chance for the second goal.
I am still proud of my team.
They changed the course of the game in the second half.
We could've been a little better.
Little things were decided in the game.
“I wish Fenerbahçe success in the next matches,” he said.
Foda stated that they feel very good while they are in Turkey and that they are happy with the hospitality they have seen.
Fernando <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul
Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, who started the transfer talks of Galatasaray Club, has arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer who arrived at Atatürk Airport was welcomed enthusiastically by the fans.
Fernando, where yellow-red fans were cheering for love, left the airport by boarding a special vehicle waiting for him under security measures.
Fernando, 30, who started his career with Brazil's Vila Nova team, playing for Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, is a midfielder.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after undergoing a medical check-up.
Galatasaray has signed a contract with Manchester City for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>250,000 for Fernando, which he has been trying to join for a long time.
U.S.-based Raqqa: Homeland Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, who has been linked to the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) through videoconference management from Baghdad, said the coalition-trained Raqqa Home Security Force (RIGG) has begun to settle in areas cleared of Daesh in the city.
"In the cleared areas of the city, the Raqqa Home Security Force, mostly composed of Arabs and anti-Daesh local volunteers, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from escaping or returning," Dillon said.
Dillon said 230 people had completed their training this week and joined the group, adding that "for now, the number of such forces is 850".
Dillon said the coalition provided the group with basic weapons training, as well as training on first aid, armed conflict, screening and checkpoint operations.
The interest in the Raqqa Homeland Security Force is intense, Dillon said, adding that the coalition will continue to screen applicants for training and employment.
The US-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which are the main backbone of the PYD/PKK in the takeover of Raqqa.
The PYD/PKK terrorist group has appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Mohammed as co-chair of the Raqqa civilian governing council.
It is alleged that within the military force in Raqqa there will be members of the PKK/PYD.
Dillon also announced that he had collected heavy weapons from the opposition group Shuheda Karyateyn (Shuhuhuk) in Al Tanif camp in southern Syria, where the U.S.-led coalition had cut back its support last week.
"After meeting with their leaders last week, Shuhuk brought back the heavy weapons and equipment that the coalition had given them, but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to remain with them," Dillon said.
The U.S. withdrew its support from Shuhuk last week on the grounds that it was patrolling out of the conflict zones it had agreed with Russia and engaged in activities not related to the fight against Daesh.
In addition to Daesh, the group also wants to fight against the Bashar al-Assad regime.
According to leaked phone call notes, Trump has pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
Notes of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have been leaked by the Washington Post.
In a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump pressed him not to publicly say he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. president reprimanded the Mexican president who was holding the wall in public and said, "You can't tell the press about this."
Trump launched his presidential campaign on building a wall along the southern border of the United States and promised to make Mexico pay for the project.
Notes from his first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who revealed a heated dialogue, were also released.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the U.S. deal to retrieve refugees to Australia was “maskable,” “rotten,” and “stupid,” and that the Obama administration’s deal would make him look “stupid” after offering a ban on resettling a refugee in the United States.
Trump told Turnbull, “This was the most unpleasant speech I’ve had all day.”
The patient broke the doctor’s nose.
Turkish Higher Specialty Training and Research Hospital doctors and employees left short-term work yesterday morning in order to react to the beatings of a doctor friend by his patient relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance of the hospital with foreign currencies written "No to violence in health", which they carried in their hands, reacted to the incident.
Prof. Dr. Feyza Ay<0xC5><0x9F>enur Pa<0xC4><0x9F>, head of the Children's Cardiology Clinic at the hospital, said: "The slogan 'No to violence in health' sounds to me like an inadequate or even a side slogan."
In health, there is no place for violence.
He said, "If this is the way it is, the people will soon not find a health group to serve themselves."
The action of the health workers was supported by Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Turkmen, Ankara First Regional Public Hospitals General Secretary Prof. <0xC3><0x96>ner Odabas, Turkey Higher Specialized Training and Research Hospital Chief Physician Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and patient relatives in the hospital garden.
This was the case, he said:
Unfortunately, violence against health workers is increasing.
We have relived an example of this incident yesterday (the previous day) in the evening, when our cardiovascular surgeon was beaten by a patient’s relative.
Although we have taken all the measures we can as our state, ministry and governorship to put an end to these events as soon as possible, we also demand that the sensitivity of our people to this issue be increased.
I condemn the events of yesterday on behalf of my hospital and health care workers.
Odaba<0xC5><0x9F>, who pointed out that the society should be aware of violence in health, said: "Unfortunately, this has become a professional complication that we have experienced from time to time."
“We will take our own precautions, but the most important thing is that our nation has its own health care provider,” he said.
"Our laws on violence in health have been proven to be effective enough," Turkmen said.
Government agencies are implementing this.
He's working on security right now.
In the past, they were always on the loose, but now it's a direct public case, and the government appoints a lawyer and follows the case.
"There are also examples of severe punishments for this," he said.
Following the announcement, the workers continued their work.
The incident allegedly happened at around 5:45 a.m. the day before.
The relatives of the patient who died in intensive care attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet <0xC3><0x96>zbek, who worked in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, who reported the death.
Uzbek was removed from the scene by doctors and assistants; police were called to the hospital.
While Uzbek's nose was broken in the incident, the attackers were detained.
One of the witnesses to the incident said:
When our friend went to the patient’s relatives to report the condition of a deceased patient, the patient’s relatives attacked our friend and two of our friends, accusing us of the situation.
Our friend's nose was broken, she was covered in blood.
Then we took our friend into the O.R. and hid it.
We had 15-20 minutes of security between us.
If the patient's relatives had crossed that firewall, something much worse would have happened.

YPG raids in Syria...
The United States intervened
According to local sources, YPG terrorists looted the homes of the residents of Tel Semin village in northern rural Raqqa, where they entered with U.S. military support for fighting the terrorist organization Daesh.
The reaction of civilians whose houses were looted and confiscated has turned into a conflict with a terrorist organization.
Then the U.S. forces in the region entered the town with armored vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type armored vehicles, personnel carriers and Husky type mine detection vehicles were seen to form a buffer zone in the resort.
The terrorist organization YPG does not allow civilians fleeing death in Raqqa, which is being shelled as part of an anti-Daesh operation, to enter the controlled cities.
The local activist network "Rakka is being silently slaughtered" announced on Monday that 121 civilians had been killed in an artillery fire in July alone.
Let's not take the old world's fights to tomorrow
Delayed perception of domestic and world realities can lead to crises, not by ordinary people, but by countries.
One of the reasons why the backward East, which we characterize as "characterism," perceives world realities as being delayed, may be that the reflection of these realities into the geographies of the East is blocked by certain focal points, or that they are being advertised beyond reality.
Don Quixote and Oblomov have been the subject of the world of literature to perceive the facts and change by delay or not at all.
Cervantes' "Don Quixote" is a madman who still thinks himself a knight when he returns when the bourgeoisie begins to form.
Or Goncharov's "Oblomov" is a lazy heir who thinks that when he ignores the facts, everything can go on as before.
For example, China was an open and sea-dominated country until the end of the 15th century, when a conservative dynasty came to power.
This led to the execution of the captains of the boats sailing out of the Chinese land waters.
We Turks, who have one foot, eye and ear in the West, and the other in the East, have had constant dilemmas about perceiving the truth and change, starting with the Ottomans.
We have tried to carry yesterday to today, to understand today with concepts that fit the old conditions, to think yesterday is tomorrow.
One part of us has been able to act as fast as the thinking centers in the developed countries in terms of perception of the realities of the homeland and the world, as well as the reality of change.
This has led to constant conflicts and tensions.
With Madrasa, the university, the modern army, the conflicts of doubt with faith, caused a dramatic dualism.
And, worse yet, it is not accepted that new and advanced postures, at some point in time, will eventually become obsolete and will be left behind.
After a period of time yesterday's progressives began to declare the new and advanced "Dangerous" and those who tried to interpret the conditions of the home and the world in accordance with the current reality "Traitor".
The most important lesson in the Ottoman Empire was that those who perceived the truths of the homeland and the world by delay dominated the life of thought and state, eventually the empire disintegrated, collapsed and the people became poor.
The most important lesson that our Ottoman past passed on to the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of world conjuncture and change was an inevitable prerequisite for survival.
Since this lesson is so well assimilated, we have been able to be the exemplary country of this geography, which has managed to maintain its unity, integrity and stability in peace since the First World War.
In order to survive the process of global change in a different approach, we need to leave the memorabilia behind and act in accordance with the facts.
In other words, there will be no benefit to anyone from bringing to the present the meaningless campings and blood feuds that have caused our democracy to limp in the past.
And in today’s world, the smallest mistakes lead to huge and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography in this regard is the Middle East in which we are.

Winds of Turkey
Global giants, who trusted Turkey's future, struggled against the breaker in yesterday's wind farm tender.
The world record was broken in the tender with the model set by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources to reduce the dependence on the outside and to ensure the transition to national energy.
Turkey’s energy costs will be lowered by the tender of 1 billion dollars investment and close to 4 thousand jobs have also been opened.
Until 2019, domestic production wind turbines will be included in the system.
Eight consortiums, including U.S., Chinese, German and Danish giants, participated in the license tender for renewable resource areas (YEKA) wind farms opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.
At the tender, financial proposal envelopes were opened to identify the 5 bidders who initially placed the lowest bid.
Following the initial bid envelopes, the lowest bid was $4.19/kilowatt-hour.
The open deduction range was set at 0.01 cents.
After the tender began, the joint venture groups Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided not to participate in the open reduction.
In the open deficit, groups of Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed.
Following the withdrawal of the Nordex consortium, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon remained in the final two.
MingYang-First Construction took 11 breaks.
The Siemens-Turkers-Galyon Energy consortium never took a break.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak: A record day for Turkey.
The open cut continued for 30 rounds.
The winner of the intense competition between the two consortiums was the Siemens-Türkerler-Galyon joint venture group with the lowest bid at $3.48 cents/kilowatt-hour.
The consortium offered $3.49 cents/kilowatt-hour in the tender, while Deputy Undersecretary Alparslan Bayraktar at the request of the tender commission headed by his bidder drew his bid to 3.48.
With the result of the two-hour YEKA tender, Turkey achieved a world record.
$3.48/cent per kilowatt-hour offered in the tender is the world’s lowest figure in this area.
The previous record was in the hands of Mexico at $3.84/cent per kilowatt hour.
Berat Albayrak, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, who held a press conference following the conclusion of the tender, said that the win of the German company Siemens was an important message to the region and the world, "I think this result will make a significant contribution to the Turkish-German relations in terms of 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany."
Our goals are big.
The result that emerged today has revealed how robust and confident the economy and energy market is moving towards the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I am very proud to show that Turkey is among the most reliable investmentable countries in the region and the world.
“All of Turkey, in this picture, which we will be proud of as 80 million, the biggest contribution is our President, who, within 15 years of his power and leadership, has brought Turkey to this point,” he said.
Albayrak, who stated that they started a new era with an open, transparent and scrutinized competition tender, said: "One of the most important steps of this was the cost of buying 10.3 USD/cent per kilowatt hour with a local contribution in the wind until yesterday, falling to a historical record of 3.48 USD/cent at a world record price."
I am proud of this, on behalf of my country.
Minister Albayrak stated that they aim to commission the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018, "I hope we will include our domestic production wind turbines in the system until the beginning of 2019," he said.
Turbines will be installed in five designated areas.
The winning company will put in service a thousand megawatts of installed power in each of these 5 regions, with the condition of installing a wind power of at least 50 megawatts.
The total investment of the Siemens-Türkerler-Kalyon group will be more than $1 billion.
With the introduction of domestic wind farms, a minimum of 3 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity will be generated each year, and about 1.1 million homes will need annual electricity from the wind.
Thanks to wind plants to be installed, an average of 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emissions will be reduced.
The winning company will build a factory with an investment of over $100 million.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 domestic wind turbines with a capacity of at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium will do R<0x26>D work for 10 years in at least three areas of wing, generator design, material technologies and production techniques, software and innovative gearbox.
While a $5 million budget is allocated annually for R<0x26>D studies, 50 technical personnel will be employed, 80% of which are domestic engineers.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract is signed.
The project's licensing period is 30 years.
Kaz<0xC4><0xB1>m Türker, Chairman of the Board of Türkerler <0xC4><0xB0>n<0xC5><0x9F>aat, who took part in the consortium that won the tender, stated that domestic production will be around 64 percent in the project and 35 percent of the equipment will come from abroad and said, "We plan to finance the equipment from foreign sources and the rest from domestic banks."
Turker said the tender reflects confidence in the Turkish economy.
Kalyon Holding Enerji Group President Murtaza Ata said: "It has become an auction that will reduce Turkey's dependence on the outside by a thousand megawatts."
“We are pleased with the result,” he said.
Hakan Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>m, Chief Executive Officer of Siemens Gamesa Turkey, stated that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years and said, "We will do our best to reduce the cost of electricity units further."
The locality of the wind turbines to be produced in the factory will be at least 65%.
Of the 8,000 industrial parts in the wind turbine, 65% will be domestic (at least 5,200 parts).
At least 50 MW and a total of 1,000 MW will be installed in each of the five regions.

Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Revival Racist Linch Case for Call to Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of spectators in the countryside of Monroe Georgia, and made his way to the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car, with four black passengers and a white driver, stepped forward to block the path of a group of armed white men before reaching the bridge.
The leader of the gang, a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit, took a long breath from his cigar and looked carefully through the windshield.
Inside, the people were terrified.
"We want that z... we want that, Roger!" he barked.
"Get him out of the car!"
As a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat, screams pierced through the darkness.
Fortunately, this horrific scene played on June 22nd is just a remake.
But when a loop was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience breathed quite realistically.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have been returning to the Ford Bridge in Moore to revive the lynching of two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been charged with the murders.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the revival, said: "It doesn't make sense that even if we see them in our communities and know who they are, not one person has been arrested all these years."
"This is a stain on history, but a burden on our souls."
Brooks was a 71-year-old former Georgian state congressman and lifelong human rights defender.
For him, this revival is a call to dramatic action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that injustice has never been rectified.
“We want prosecution, we want results, we want wounds to be healed, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first,” he said.
"We can't have the wounds clinging and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner put a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Ford lynch in Moore on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding areas were suspected of lynching.
Not one of them has ever been investigated.
Though the suspects have remained fugitives for decades, human rights defenders say the twin motivations of lynchings have always been well known throughout the town: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling made it possible for black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in a pre-election vote at the end of that summer.
Nearly at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black partner Roger Malcolm stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester during a fight apparently about a woman.
Brooks said the town's gossip was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her own husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to get Malcolm out of jail.
Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey went to jail.
But when they arrived at the Ford Bridge in Moore, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
An FBI report concludes, "It turns out, it was Harrison who arranged and ordered the murders."
"Also, it's clear that there was a secret agreement between the state and local law enforcement that not only involved in the murder but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses."
Brooks was shorter and more concise.
He said: "It was a right to vote.
“They were all killed to send a message to the black people in this community: ‘This is what will happen to you if you register and vote.’”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been leading the revival of Ford Bridge lynchings in Moore, which take place every year.
Its performance reveals all the details, it’s remarkable, and it’s based on a deep type of racism that many believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to turn your eyes, but Greene says that’s the point.
He said, "We don't want to talk about lynch because it's confronting all of us with the ugliness within us."
"But if you don't listen to me or what's happening to me, I can't develop a relationship with you."
Rehearsals for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) stepped into a room and listened when Greene enthusiastically embarked on the well-rehearsed overviews of the game.
Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's assistant director.
Over the years, he played the role of President Klansman, but he says the role never gets easier.
Marbaugh said, "I feel dirty because that's not me."
“But I think it’s important to keep this past alive because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
Throughout the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, were rehearsing their own lines.
The game starts when Malcolm yells at Hester and pushes her away because she's so angry that he's sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.
"Z...i, get out of my property!"
Rascona is reacting.
There's a shot.
And then everyone (at least black actors) laughs.
Greene laughs the most.
Rascona asked, "What?"
He was agitated, surprised.
Was I too hard?
Greene said "No" in a chuckle.
“I just don’t think the white people at the time were saying z...i.”
One of the black players said yes and threw a joke.
"'R' must be suppressed."
So the energy in the room changes, and a kind of intimacy takes the place of restlessness.
Everyone is dedicated to doing it right, not just for the sake of the game, but also for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene begins again.
This time she says the word that starts with Rascona N, sharp and accentuated.
Absolutely no one is laughing.
The revival ends violently and quickly.
There's screams, gunfire, and then silence.
A woman dressed in funeral black stands on the bodies of the actors and reads Billie Holiday’s sad melody “Strange Fruit.”
His voice breaks in one of the two words.
One hundred yards behind, an average of four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided, black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the performance, many from the road ahead.
While Brooks took them on a sacred journey to the graveyards of the Malcoms and Dorseys, they all endured Georgia's repressive humidity for almost eight hours.
Until this point, the murders remained an anecdote, but now standing in the same place where the wound is, it feels like the air is cursed.
As the final notes of the song weaken, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and examine the bodies.
Children squat on their hands, grasping fake blood and immobile bodies, and whispering to each other.
A little boy mumbles, "They're not really dead," as if he's reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Greene thanked the crowd and suddenly stopped.
The actors throw the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbaugh in a suit who plays President Klansman.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his playmates and tears flow in their arms, the emotional cost of the performance finally comes to him.
One of the women whispers, "It's all right."
"We know that's not what's in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Afterwards, the audience sat down to dinner with the actors.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta are having a heated conversation about revival with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski has difficulty finding words about how performance makes her feel.
He said, "Hearing these horrible, horrible words and those behaviors... they come from people who look like you, and they do it because they look like you."
“What this does to me is make me think that the lynchings are still going on,” he added, “they’re now called police armed attacks.”
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks eats at his desk and talks about his memories of human rights.
He said he's already planning next year's performance.
He said, "Revival is kind of inspiring because it describes what we've endured, but it's also instructive."
"It's like if you don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who don’t know their past, those who don’t know their past, are doomed to repeat it.”

AK Party's special website
The Party, 6.
A website with the address "akkongreler.com" was established for the ordinary Congress process.
On the website, there are brochures, materials and images that the party organization will use in this process.
In the 'Communication Strategy' section of the site, the rules to be followed during the congress process are listed in 14 titles.
President and AK Party President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, whose message is posted on the website, warned members of the organization to follow the party's corporate identity during the congress process.
In his message, Erdogan said, “Now we are beginning a new era of breakthroughs.”
We need to be renewed and renewed in order to reach our 2023 goals with more solid steps.
"Tomorrow, as yesterday, we must continue to work hand in hand, shoulder in hand," he said.
To revitalize the business, Pearson cut 3,000 jobs, cut profits
British training group Pearson said on Friday it would start another restructuring program to tackle the pressures facing the business, adding 3,000 more layoffs and reducing the average profit share by 72 percent.
Chief Executive John Fallon said the layoffs, mostly in late 2018 and early 2019, would add to the 4,000 positions lost in the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan that would save an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300m ($394m) by attempting to revive the rapidly shifting business to digital learning through a third cost-cutting program.
The firm, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, reported a <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion increase in base sales in the first half of the year.
The 2nd one brought me back to life!
According to the first report of the Forensic Medicine Authority, according to the initial findings in the preliminary autopsy report of Hakan, his death was suicide.
In the detailed examination, there were no traces of blows or algebra in the child's body.
The reason for the suicide is that the elastic bandage around his neck was squeezed, leaving him breathless.
It was also determined that the cloth, which his family indicated as a bandage, was an elastic bandage used in the wounds.
According to the newspaper Habertürk, after the preparation of a detailed report on the death of the child, it was learned that the report stating that the incident was suicide will be sent to Büyükçekmece Prosecutor's Office, which conducts the investigation.
While police are investigating the child’s suicide in detail, investigations are continuing on his computer confiscated after the incident.
The police said that Hakan's friends will also testify.
It is also stated that the information obtained from Hakan's computer, which his relatives call "Clean", can be accessed by third parties or a gang.
Police are assessing that Hakan may have been dragged into suicide by a gang.
The certainty that Hakan committed suicide turned his eyes to violent Metin2.
Metin2, which was banned by the governorate of Antalya last year for minors under the age of 15 on the grounds of addiction and violence in children, came to the fore with the murder of 13-year-old "mini hacker" Metin Kang" in 2009.
In order to play Metin2, designed in Korea in 2005, it is necessary to register a member.
Players try to bring peace and justice to the world with the dragon god in the game.
There are wars going on, the violence is increasing.
In addition to images of war with cutting-edge, piercing weapons such as lines, swords, machetes, axes, the game features images of people being slaughtered and eaten by wild animals.
The player buys characters with money to get stronger.
The family who buried their children the next day following the July 25 incident in the house in Köknar Sokak, Esenyurt <0xC4><0xB0>stiklal Neighborhood, continued the murder claim.
"All his dream was to be a doctor, and we don't think he could hurt himself or anyone else because of the game," he said. "They wrapped an elastic band around his neck and made a knot on the side."
That's how it was found, son.
We certainly don't think that our son could hurt himself or anyone else because of a game on the Internet, or he could commit suicide.
We knew he was playing a game like that.
It wasn't a game he was playing.
Let's just say he got bored a little bit and left the game.
The mother said, “No one can enter the building.”
It is said that at a certain time my child entered the house.
None of them match.
When his brother came home, there was only one chair.
“But when his body was found, there were two chairs next to the computer,” he said.
Previous Previous post: Could be infected with the virus
Families generally don’t pay attention to this.
They're like, "My kid's home, no matter what's happening."
The child communicates with many people through games.
There may have been a lending situation, a borrowing situation, or a swearing.
Or he invited someone in the game to come home, and there may have been a problem between them.
He may have been affected by problems with other people he interacted with not directly from the game, but through the game.
The child may have thought the game was real.
The trauma that leads to suicide could be about blackmail.
If the child is faced with a family complaint, there is also a situation of depression because he cannot solve the problem.
He couldn't have committed suicide because of the game itself.
There's also the possibility that the kid might get involved in the gang.
He might be involved with the gang.
There is nothing that a child can do alone.
Information systems consultant Füsun NEBIL: Parents should know the interaction of their children
We can’t say that games are harmful.
Studies have shown that games are beneficial for children’s development.
What’s important here is that parents pay attention to what their children are playing and how they are talking to players online.
Parents should know how their children are affected and take precautions.
In Turkey, there are only two children in five years who are said to have died because of the game.
It also shows that the end of a child's life is not just the impact of games.
I wonder what drove this boy to do this.
We have to find out first.
You need to look at the sociology and psychology around the child.
The stock market in <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul has increased by 8 months to 50%.
The BIST 100 index continued its upward trend that it started in December 2016 in July and carried its rise to the 8th month at the top.

Looking at the historical process of the BIST 100 index, it has been seen that it has performed similar performances in the past.
The BIST 100 index, which last gained value for 8 consecutive months between December 2006 and July 2007, increased by 38.3% during this period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index was completed 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997 and 9 months in a row between May 1997 and January 1998.
Meksa Investment Research Director Eren Can <0xC3><0x9C>müt told AA reporter that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months and that the increase has exceeded the 37% level since the beginning of the year.
<0xC3><0x9C>müt noted that the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) index is up 23%, and that there is a positive breakdown even when we look at these rates:
The flow of funds to developing countries has continued since the beginning of the year.
In particular, funds in the search for higher returns prefer countries with higher interest rates.
In this case, domestic markets are positively affected.
Of course, the appetite for risk-taking on a global scale is also very high.
In this way, stock indices with risky asset status are in demand.
In the United States, the S<0x26>P 500 index has risen nearly 11 percent since the beginning of the year, and we see new record levels being tested almost every week.
Emphasizing that at the beginning of the year, the U.S. Central Office (Fed)’s three interest rate hikes were stressing forecast markets, but using the Fed’s policy of verbal redirection rather well to eliminate uncertainty, Umut said there was an insensitive market to the Fed’s interest rate hike.
<0xC3><0x9C>müt said that inflation in the United States is not yet at the desired level, that the Fed's expectations that it will not rush to raise interest rates and avoid radical moves are also very effective at current prices.
The inability of US President Donald Trump to cancel the health reform known as "Obamacare" strengthened the perception that expanding fiscal policies could not fulfill their promises, he said. "Although the expectations of the US economy growing faster thanks to Trump have a positive impact on the stock markets for a period of time, the lack of promises is strengthening the Fed's and the market's hand in response to faster growth and inflation in this context."
<0xC3><0x9C>müt pointed out that 2016 is a year of many negatives in terms of the Turkish markets and said that it is trying to close the gap according to the similarities of the negatively decomposed and over-sold BIST 100 index.
Noting that they did not see a strong recovery with domestic source news feed, <0xC3><0x9C>müt said that the current view can be interpreted more as an increase in risk-taking appetite abroad and a desire to close the gap between domestic markets compared to their counterparts.
<0xC3><0x9C>müt stated that it monitored some profit sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records with 108,600 levels:
In particular, the 109,500-110,000 zones are a critical threshold in the short term.
After approaching these levels, it is normal for profit sales to take place.
In the short term, we think a new local or global story should be created for pricing over 110,000.
For the time being, a downward trend of support of 107,500 could trigger profit sales.
In this case, although we follow the 107,000 intermediate support, I think that relaxation can be seen up to 106,000-105.500 zones.
In particular, the breakdown of the 105,500 support could result in a withdrawal of up to 104,300, which corresponds to 50 percent of the increase from 100,000 to 108,600 Fibo.
Both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) decisions will be at the focal point of the global market, <0xC3><0x9C>müt said expectations for the Fed are already clear, but the possibility of a balance sheet reduction program to take effect in September FOMC is unlikely to be expected.
<0xC3><0x9C>müt said that this situation could trigger profit sales in emerging country (GOU) stock indices, which are in the shadow of overbought in the short term, "What is important is what the ECB will say."
After the July monetary policy board meeting, ECB President Mario Draghi said that they would discuss the course of monetary policy in the fall, and this rhetoric led to the rise of the euro/dollar parity above 1,1700 levels.
Therefore, statements that the 60 billion euro asset purchase program could be reduced or terminated would mean that post-Fed liquidity would also be reduced globally by the ECB.
"As a result, negative prices may appear on behalf of the markets of the country, which, like Turkey, provides high current openness and requires access to external funds," he said.
Gedik Investment Advisory Director Erol Gürcan said that after Trump's election in the United States in November 2016, there was a rather serious rally in terms of global stock markets.
It is possible to say that the key element that triggered this rally movement is developments that increase global growth expectations, especially Trump’s promises for tax cuts, he noted:
Borsa <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul was also at the top of the leading stock exchanges in the global rally.
While one of the main reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained fairly discounted compared to similar emerging markets in recent years, it is worth mentioning that the steps taken by policymakers to support the economy and financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (CGF), which has been active since March, has had a serious impact on the rise in the index so far.
In the remainder of the year, positive developments are reflected in pricing significantly and KGF, which has a significant role in this rise, has gradually reached satisfaction, Gürcan said, although the BIST 100 index is still discounted compared to similar country markets, the search for a new story for the rest of the year may also gradually come to the forefront.
Gürcan noted that developments such as the 180-day action plan, which has been eagerly anticipated for some time, such as increasing the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, making arrangements in support of company profits, and the possible tax deduction that has recently been raised, can contribute positively in this regard.
Emphasizing that key developed countries such as Gurcan, the Fed, the ECB, and the Bank of England (BoE) will also gradually tighten their current expansionary monetary policy stances, it is still among the critical risk factors for developing countries, adding that "the Fed, which will continue to increase interest rates for a long time, will likely increase interest rates after the centralization of the Fed's highly likely country after September, and that the ECB will start the balance reduction process in the near term.
Gürcan said that the 104.150-104.600 support zone, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average with the upward trend seen since the beginning of the year, in possible correction movements in the index in the coming period, is quite critical, and that the correction movement can continue to 101.700, 100,000, 99.200 levels if this support zone is broken, respectively.
If the current upward trend is maintained and the current historical peak level of 108,605 resistance is broken, the index can rise to the range of 110,000-112,000.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO military killed in suicide attack
Authorities say a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing a NATO soldier and injuring several.
NATO said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
Unconfirmed local sources say three civilians were killed in the incident in the city's Karabakh region.
The bombing was the last act of violence in Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a mosque explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement Thursday evening that the blast was carried out on a joint patrol mission with the Afghan army with ‘personal-guided hand-made explosives’.
The statement said all the injured were in good health and were being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram air base.
Reporters say the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh are a major concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed at least 1662 civilian deaths, an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bombing car killed at least 30 people in the mostly Shiite area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, after US-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001, a massive bombing in the city's center killed more than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant attack.
The act of violence highlights the unstable security situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump weighs heavily on whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the military and police in the country.
Reporters say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially President Ashraf Ghani's reputation.
EPA refuses to delay polluted air rule after trials
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has returned from a decision to delay the law, a Obama-era law that requires states to block emissions that cause dirty smoke, the day after 15 states filed lawsuits against the initiative.
On Wednesday, the EPA announced its decision to continue with the "2015 Ozone Decisions", saying the organization was determined to work with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and being responsive to them," EPA President Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s intention to delay the ozone decisions by one year until October 2018, with the current dirty smoke pollution being measured in various parts of the country and where it is necessary to cut down to meet more stringent air quality standards.
The 15 mostly Democrat states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration continues its quest to take back the wide range of environmental regulations implemented by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump calls to revitalize economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked a reaction from Democrats and other protectionist groups concerned about the impact of more emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says inhaling ozone-containing air can “reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms like asthma.”
The forest gave good news...
Time for the stop and wing transfer!
Besiktas President Fikret Orman made statements to Bein Sports about the transfer of Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and stopper.
The Forests have said...
No surprises in the transfer.
It's not a transfer, it's a point shot.
Now we're going to make a stopper and a wing transfer.
We have a Champions League game and I hope we get a good draw.
We have to make a wing transfer.
10 million euros is easy, but we don’t have that kind of budget.
If it comes to our budgets, we will transfer and if we don’t, we won’t die.
I can't tell you anything about the lens until it's clear.
We are a public company.
The end of patience is peace.
Is there no ISIS threat for the festival that only exists for 30 August?
Protests continue when the Ankara Governorate banned all public gatherings, such as sit-ins, memorial meetings and concerts throughout August on the grounds of the "Daesh threat".
The banning decision of the governorship included the expression "all collective activities", while in Ankara 7.
The International Grand Ankara Festival continues.
Levent Gök, CHP Group Deputy and Ankara MP, told S<0xC3><0x96>Z<0xC3><0x9C> that "August 30 cannot be affected by the prohibitions" and said:
There's some serious confusion.
Even the governor is hesitant about what decision he will make.
The task of the state is to create places to celebrate holidays.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir said, "All Ankara has a security problem, only Gökçek's organizations do not have a security problem."
Ankara Independent Deputy Aylin Nazl<0xC4><0xB1>aka moved the ban to the parliament.
"Doesn't this prohibition clearly demonstrate the AKP's republican and Atatürk hostility? How do you think to prevent the millions who will celebrate August 30 in the fields?", Nazl<0xC4><0xB1>aka said.
“I learned from Edwina that I was cheated.”
The day before his death, Abraham’s wife, Isaac’s wife, was killed by her husband.
<0xC5><0x9E>ener, who filed a spiritual compensation lawsuit against Edwina Sponza, who claimed to have destroyed her nest, had submitted together photos of Sponza and Kutluay to the court as evidence.
The socially beautiful Sponza also filed a criminal complaint against <0xC5><0x9E>ener, saying, "The bundle illegally seized my private photos."
"I didn't know I could eat."
<0xC5><0x9E>ener, who met with his lawyer in Ni<0xC5><0x9F>anta<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1> Delicatessen after this recent development, left the place when he saw the journalists.
<0xC5><0x9E>ener, who was very cheerful, laughed when he was reminded of Edwina Sponza’s claim about the photographs, saying, “God, I think I went into her house and took it.”
“There is such a complaint, but its contents are not true.”
“We have it all, we’ve brought it to court,” he said.
<0xC5><0x9E>ener told reporters that “everyone knew about your husband’s relationship with Sponza recently.”
“How did you not know?” he asked, surprised.
What's that?
What's that?
“I swear,” she said, “I don’t know if I’m going to believe the rumors of my husband or the rumors of the world.”
<0xC5><0x9E>ener, who first said "No" after the journalists persistently asked "Have you never heard of it?", continued: "I didn't hear it, of course I heard it the first time."
But I never believed in anything like that.
Everything was normal, there was nothing to suspect.
Ma'am, when you put it all in my hands, I've learned it all, so it's new...
<0xC5><0x9E>ener answered "Yes" to the question "Was Sponza the one who sent the evidence?" and was confused by claiming that Sponza himself had sent him the photographs and correspondence he had submitted to the court.
Sponza had previously claimed that his correspondence with Ibrahim Kutluay was assembling.
Besiktas will sign a contract with Negredo tomorrow

Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar's Minister of Economy and Trade, Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani, said they would like to express their gratitude to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: “Thank you very much for your honorable attitude and for the support you have given us.”
My brother, President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, sends his greetings to the Emir of Qatar.
The Qatari economy has proven its resilience.
In many countries, our economy remains intact while our economies are negatively impacted.
We must work hard to make Qatar independent and strong.
We have largely broken the embargo against us within hours thanks to Turkey.
We are not lacking in anything at the moment.
Our natural resources, natural gas exports are a great support to Qatar’s economy.
Thanks to Turkey, we were not affected by the blockade against the law, which was brutally carried out against us.
Today, Qatar continues its worldwide production in natural gas and LNG.
“After what happened, we did not experience a decrease in our natural gas exports, but rather a 30 percent increase,” he said.
Al Thani said that the brotherhood relations between Qatar and Turkey continue to work in all areas, adding that "In the first quarter, a volume of $554 million was formed in the volume of trade between us."
The decisions made in the past have played an important role in this.
As a result of the fact that Turkish products have proven themselves in the Qatar market, it is extremely important for us to accelerate the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors and make investments in many areas.
“Thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us,” he said.
The cost of the last disaster is 300 million TL
TSB President Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar stated that after the flood on July 18, the insurance companies received 116 million TL 7 thousand damage reports, 12 million TL 800 damage reports were received in the Gokova earthquake on July 21, and that the floods and hail in Istanbul on July 27 found 168 million TL 22 thousand damage reports, the last three said that it was insured.
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, "The damage caused by the hail in terms of Kasko insurance is around 3,500 liras per vehicle, and the glass damage is around 1000 liras."
“In the earthquake, the average housing damage is <0xC2><0xA3>6000,” he said.
Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, who emphasized that they have made great efforts as a sector to compensate for economic losses, stated that 3 out of 4 people do not have housing insurance, 2 out of 2 businesses do not have fire insurance and 2 out of 3 people do not have insurance, said: "The risk of natural disasters increases due to climate change."
Due to the low insurance rate in our country, the risk of serious damage costs of our citizens and institutions is increasing day by day.
All these costs should not be left to the state.
Insurance policies aren’t as expensive as they seem, and insurance isn’t just an industry that pays damage; it’s also a risk management consultancy.
Increasing the insurance awareness and insurance rate is very important for our people and our country.
Can Ak<0xC4><0xB1>n <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, "In the general terms of Kasko insurance, it is written that the insureds should report their damage within 5 working days and this period has ended yesterday."
"Will there be an insured victim?" he answered, "Although there is such a period in general terms, the expiration period in the Commercial Code is 2 years."
“This is also a natural disaster, so there’s no need for insureds to panic, no company says they don’t pay,” he said.
This is how the German media saw the giant auction!
In a period of increasing tensions between Turkey and Germany, the German Siemens company won Turkey's first Wind Energy Renewable Energy Resource Areas (YEKA) tender.
German media reported the development with the words "German Siemens won the giant tender in Turkey".
"The consortium will invest over $1 billion in wind plant," DWell Turkish said in the news that the Siemens-Tukerler-Kalyon consortium won the YEKA tender.
"The tender for the creation of a thousand megawatts of wind power capacity is Turkey's first YEKA tender", the number of companies competing in the tender decreased from 8 to 2 today, the Chinese Mingyang and the German Siemens consortiums faced, and the Chinese Mingyang consortium was told about the 30th round when it started.
After the tender, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Berat Albayrak made a striking statement on Turkey-German relations.
The tender ended with the win of the German company Siemens, and we can say that this picture is an important message to the region and the world.
When we look at 200 years of historical cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think that this result will make a significant contribution to the Turkish-German relations.
No matter how many regional crises in the world, I was very proud to show that Turkey is among the most reliable investmentable countries in the region and the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible match
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who would cross paths to show off the most satisfying boxing match in the near future for a total of under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until the Invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia walked down the hallway and saluted the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion Lomachenko.
On Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are among the top five on the weight-loss list, following Garcia's defeat of former world champion Adrien Broner in four weights.
Garcia held out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN Saturday night at 7 p.m.
While the two posed for photos, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar noted that a potential competition between fighters would be "perfectly large".
Garcia reminds me, "I'm an old featherweight."
“I went up for the Bronner at 140 pounds, but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to the lightweight.
He's got to get through the lightweight (135 pounds), then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let’s give it to them.”
Lomachenko joined.
"Box needs this fight."
Air conditioning asked if it should be on pay and watch; setting a date with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) for the next summer and getting Lomachenko to fight in a 135-pound opening match this year is part of his strategy; Garcia is also showing interest in fighting Jorge Linares-Luce Camp for his lightweight title at the Forum on September 23.
"The fight can be on 'pay and watch' because that's what all the fans want," Garcia said, adding that he was open to which channel offered the best financial package.
We're the real names.
No other name creates such a degree of interest.
When they are ready...”
Garcia said she admired Lomachenko as a "great fighter" and could participate in Saturday's match.
But Lomachenko hesitated to place a plethora of praise on Garcia, and said that he thought the three weight-loss champions from Riverside looked "too slow", "sorry, Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."
Garcia said the focus was boxing first, then showing the punch power.
Both said they felt the momentum was created for their own encounter.
“This is a fight that needs to be fought.
Another fight won't generate that much interest and rumor.
Garcia said, "I'm very happy to be dealing with this."
Lomachenko said: “I waited for the best fighters and he was Mikey.
It's going to be a great fight."
Turkey Resti from Russia to America
The White House does not intend to impose sanctions that will affect Moscow's pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of these lines.
This is because of the increased cost of debt.
Worried that Western investment partners would consider withdrawing from the projects due to sanctions, the Kremlin has accelerated the construction of pipelines in return.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which has built the Turkish Stream line, which is planned to reach Turkey under the Black Sea, has accelerated construction at Gazprom's request.
Gazprom has also started the construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream in order to export more gas to Europe, Reuters said.
New Results of Sweden’s Asylum Age Assessment Test
The latest results of assessment tests of refugees subjected to a new medical age assessment method in Sweden found that more than 80 percent of those who took the test were over the age of 18, but not everyone is confident in the accuracy of these tests.
Sweden’s national Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration (Rättsmedicalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized the failures of some refugees to assess their right age.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test, and the Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration has now announced the results of a total of 2481 from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
It was found that 80 percent of them were 18 or above, and in 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration ruled that the subject was "probably 18 or above".
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was “probably under 18.”
The tests were conducted only in cases where the person’s age was suspect.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration, the results are consistent with past months.
"We don't see a big difference in statistics over the past months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local.
The high rate of cases that are judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees are lying about their age.
In May, the department announced the results of the 581 tests and said there were 442 cases "in which the study showed that people were 18 years of age or older".
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of the 581 reported cases, it found that 243 reportedly turned 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which involves x-raying the 20-year-old teeth and performing an MRI of the knee joints, and then having dentists and radiologists analyze them, is criticized in some circles.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, who evaluated the biological maturity of people with studies on whether or not they entered the age of puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I have reasons to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement used should be that.
It's very dubious to decide biological age this way.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t pretend it is,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, from the Forensic Medicine and Drug Administration, defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you might say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is small.
The greatest risk is that the person is just under the age of 18, in which case the risk is around 10 percent.”
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Hamidiye Mosque Opens for Worship Today
The Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdulhamit in 1885 by architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened for worship on Friday after restoration work.
Regional Director Mursel Sar<0xC4><0xB1> said that the restoration work started in June 2013 has been completed and the mosque is ready for opening.
Yellow gave the following information: "The restoration work was carried out in two scopes."
The first part was the repair of the mosque, the main building.
The second part was landscaping.
In the first part, about 16 million liras were spent and around 11 million liras were spent for the landscaping.
First of all, the bullets of the wooden dome were opened, after they were renovated, the external walls, impurities of external factors, rust were removed.
Drainage has been made for consolidation.
There are very rich decorations as you can see when you enter the mosque.
It's a work with star motifs, and it's very rich in pencil works.
There's a mixed style here.
"The traces of Seljuk are also seen in the Ottoman and Baroque architecture, which, considering that it was built in the 1885s, began to be influential."
ABDULHAMITE HAS A WORK
"Chandelier in the middle of the room, German Emperor 2."
He had partial malfunctions, was cleaned up and hung in place.
It's really a valuable and important piece.
There are wooden cages on both sides of the mosque, symmetrically located, which we call greetings.
We know that these were made by our great khan, Abdulhamit Khan, who built the mosque himself.
So we know that he did it with his own hands and that it was mounted here.
They are still standing here in their original form.
Sar<0xC4><0xB1> said that President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is expected to participate in the opening ceremony of the mosque.
The Pantic Claim in Göztepe
Ukrainian media reported that the 25-year-old Serbian footballer who could not enter the squad at Dinoma Kiev could be hired for a yellow-red club.
Pantic, who started football in Serbia's Red Star team, wore Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed for Dynamo Kiev last season.
West Virginia governor announces he will change party
West Virginia’s Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change his party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have abandoned me,” he said.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts... today I will tell you as a West Virginian, as a Democrat governor, I can no longer help you.”
The crowd was drowning in cheers.
"So tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to Republican," Justice added.
"If I were the technical director, I'd say it's time to start a different game."
Mr Trump had previously promised to make an important announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Democratic candidate Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
According to Forbes, he owns coal mines in five states, with the coal business he inherited from his father.
Its assets are about $1,59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Congress on Thursday evening issued a statement saying that "Government Justice's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party, who prefers to work to block our country rather than make it big again."
"With only 15 governorates and control of a small number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is bottomless leaderless and can't find a positive, unifying message," RNC women's spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS.
I will do what is best for Turkey.
Third Olympics, Turkey record holder.
He was born in Cuba, but he named Turkey his homeland...
In 2013, he became a Turkish citizen and wore the national jersey.
First he became a European champion, then a third Olympic champion.
Now it is one of Turkey's most important medal hopes at the World Athletics Championships.
Yasmani Capello, who competed in the 400-meter hurdle, spoke to SABAH before the championship, which will begin today.
They didn't want you because they didn't like your grades in Cuba.
You've got a coach, you've improved.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
Some of you think you chose Turkey for the money.
What are you talking about?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was when I left the national team.
From that moment on, I can say that I drew a line to the events that I experienced.
Then I came to Turkey at the invitation of the Fenerbahçe club.
My entry to the national team was thanks to Fenerbahçe.
They offered me an offer for reinforcements.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I had a lot of injuries in my youth, but after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey, I achieved significant successes in Rio and Amsterdam.
I can’t wait to do my best at the World Athletics Championships and win a different title.
You cried at a press conference recently.
Can you tell us why?
Whenever a question is asked about Turkey’s ownership of me, it reminds me of my childhood, of being expelled from the Cuban national team at the age of 23.
And, of course, people come to me in Turkey.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championships in Amsterdam, I felt the same way when the Independence Anthem was played.
I couldn't hold my tears.
I would also like to thank Turkey for giving me the opportunity to fulfill my dreams.
I am very happy to be part of the Turkish national team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said you could have a Turkish girlfriend before.
You're with a Turk now, you went to Cuba together.
Would you like to share your experiences?
The biggest advantage of being with a Turk is calmness.
Compared to Cuban women, peace...
Turkish girls have their relationships.
Your girlfriend is also your assistant coach.
You're together all day, does it interfere with your diet?
He eats sweeter than I do.
(Both laugh) I don’t really have a strict diet, but sometimes it interferes with what I eat.
My coach, Massimo Matrone, also often gives harsh warnings on my diet, but I know it’s for my own good.
How do you feel about Turkish food? Does your boyfriend cook for you?
Turkish women cook very well, but my girlfriend makes it better.
(Laughter) Dry bean-rice is my first choice.
I JUST LAUGHED ON HIM
My coach in Cuba didn't believe me.
He took other young people in my place.
We met in Cuba after winning medals on behalf of Turkey.
He looked at me and showed me to the young athletes next to him and said, "Look, I raised him."
I just laughed at him.
MY GLASS IS MY LIMIT
The glasses you wear at the races...
I only use it for concentration.
As soon as I put my glasses on, I cut off contact with the world and build a wall on both sides.
I'm just focusing on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
What is the first thing that comes to mind when we say Tokyo 2020?
Felix Sanchez...
At the 2012 London Olympics, she won a gold medal at the age of 35 in a 400-meter hurdle.
If he can do it, I can do it in Tokyo at 33, why not?
TURKCELL GIVES SUPPORT
Turkcell Deputy General Manager <0xC4><0xB0>smail All<0xC4><0xB1>n, saying that they believe Yasmani Capello will succeed in London, "We sincerely believe that Yasmani will represent our flag in this championship in the best way."
We wish all our athletes success in London.
“We will continue our support for the further development of Turkish athletics and greater achievements in our country,” he said.
Coe apologises for Russia's 'honest' doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the boss of global athletics, praised Russia’s sincere apology for the doping scandal, but stressed that it was not the right time for the country to be reintroduced to sport.
Russia's athletic boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that it was right to ban his country from sports and that he himself was determined to fight doping.
He apologised to “all athletes whose gold and silver medals were taken from them in the competitions.”
Despite his assessments, the IAAF Congress voted to suspend the ban after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia in November 2015.
Coe, president of the IAAF, told reporters: "Today I think it's a very sincere response, a very sincere presentation."
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation had accepted it, that it had survived the turbulent days, and that it had done everything possible to ensure the reconstruction of the federation..."
Coe also said he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of its re-admission criteria.
"I think it's a very constructive day and I think it's been moved on, but Congress supports the suggestion that the task force isn't the right time to return Russia's rights," Coe said.
“In the next few months, we will do everything we can to normalize this situation.
“Our guiding principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from the defective system.”
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict IAAF criteria will compete neutrally at the World Athletics Championships in London starting Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF task force, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met many criteria for the return of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that drug testing was still inadequate and banned coaches were still working freely.
U.S. denies YPG tanks
The U.S. Embassy in Ankara said no tanks were given to any side fighting in Syria.
The claims that hundreds of trucks filled with tanks and weapons were sent to the YPG have been denied.
The statement from the Embassy, titled "Disclosure of false news in the press about trucks going to Syria", reads as follows:
In a series of inaccurate news reports in the last few days, the United States has falsely claimed to have sent hundreds of tanks and loaded trucks to Syria to support the YPG.
These reports ignore some of the basic facts about the current situation in Syria.
The U.S. has not given tanks to any group fighting against Deasa in Syria.
Much of the U.S. military aid, primarily composed of light weapons and ammunition, supports elements of the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
The Syrian Arabs, including the SAK, are fighting to clear the deacon from the region and to return to their homes.
TYDTA President Ermut: Foreign direct investment will be above last year
TYDTA President Arda Ermut said 55 percent of all investments in the last year came after July.
According to Ermut, there was no decrease in investments due to the July 15 FET<0xC3><0x96> coup attempt, but on the contrary, there was an increase, "Maybe there would be more increase, there was a delay."
If these conditions did not exist, if there were no regional developments, we might have seen an increase in the multiplier effect.
So we have more hope for next year.
I hope it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
Already in the first five months, we're going up 11 percent compared to the first five months of last year.
But we don't think that's enough.
"We hope there will be more," he said.
"Global and regional developments are not causing us to worry," Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify the investors.
Recalling that 75 percent of direct investments normally came from Europe by 2010, Ermut continued:
That number fell to 66%.
Again, Asia’s share increased from 2% to 7-8%.
Russia's share increased.
While we were trying to do this, the Gulf countries had some problems among themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them, especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries saddens us and, as a result, allows investors to postpone their decisions a little longer.
Not only in terms of investments in Turkey, we may be experiencing some delays.
Arda Ermut recalled that there were some incidents in Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, reacted clearly and decisively to the situation.
Speaking to investors in the countries where the political crisis is the most severe, President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's reaction was, "Look, problems happen between governments, not between peoples."
Secondly, these people have come and invested in my country.
This is no different from Turkish companies.
On the contrary, when they have the slightest problem, they will come to us and we will solve it.
“We will certainly not allow them to be victims,” Ermut said, adding that they continue to support all investors with the convenience of this.
He added: “We can guarantee that in the coming period.”
You will see that neither German companies nor in any way investors from countries where we have some political problems will have any problems.
On the contrary, I hope that we will do our best to increase the investments from these countries.
We believe that the investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions about the investment climate.
"But we will do our part at this point and we will do our best to ensure that our investors and the perception of the investment environment are not affected," he said.
TYDTA President Ermut said that after the one-generation one-way strategy, Turkey has started to receive great interest from China, but if the problems in the Gulf are resolved, they expect the biggest investment from the Gulf.
"In the relations with Germany, 'We were having trouble because of these relations, we had investments because of this incident, we are running away', there is not even one investor," Ermut said, adding that there are companies that are coming, coming and following them.
“Currently, about 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are of German companies.”
In other words, almost 10% of the companies we interview from all over the world are German companies.
Some of them are companies that already have investments in Turkey.
He's either going to grow his investment, or he's got a subject, and it's clear to us as a project.
“German companies are still an important part of our daily workflow,” he said.
Emphasizing that all government agencies should be careful during the periods of perception operations to Turkey, Ermut said that the issue is sensitive and can be affected in the slightest bad communication.
Ermut, noting that what happened in the last 2-3 weeks was a good lesson, said:
Investors and politicians are always different.
We have always seen that economic relations are always a way for political developments to get on the right track.
“Germany will remain an important trading partner and an important investor.
Because they already have a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the election campaign in Germany is increasing this kind of talk.
I think once they're gone, they'll get a little better.
In Saudi Arabia, the two countries are also careful not to make negative statements.
As a result, an investor who invests in Turkey is investing by targeting all the surrounding country markets.
So not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, there have been processes that have slowed down a bit.
We are still negotiating with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are currently waiting for a decision that they might be able to make quicker.
“I see uncertainty in the negative sense because of the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I’m getting out of here,” said the Saudi investor.
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, who meet with us while they are on vacation, and we follow all their processes.
Recalling that the international direct investments (UDY) that came to Turkey last year were $12.3 billion, Arda Ermut said, “I think we will definitely pass it this year.
"But how far we will go, these regional developments will affect global uncertainties," he said.
While hoping that the multiplier effect would normally be greater, perhaps it could be a little more limited, Ermut pointed out that the first 5 months went up by 11 percent and that this could be maintained, adding, "If there is no bad development, I believe that we will definitely close the end of the year one way or another better than last year," he said.
Pointing out that a significant part of the investments taken will continue to be real estate, Ermut informed that new investments in logistics, health, fintech, IT, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing could be seen.
Emphasizing that there will be new investments to announce in the coming months, Ermut said, "We may have an investment announcement in terms of manufacturing in the near future."
It's not a billion dollars, but it's a big investment.
"There may be investments from interesting countries," he said.
4 wine companies operations in 9 provinces: 55 detainees
<0xC4><0xB0>stanbul Smuggling Crimes Branch Directorate teams found that the foil coating that covers the cork plug on the products sold by 4 wine companies was kept long and loose and the bandrolls were not glued to the bottle, the TAPDK bandrolls attached to the coating were collected after the products were sold and were marketed by attaching to newly produced wines.
Olis teams have suggested that the state lost 20 million 400 thousand pounds of tax due to repeated use of bandrollers by the suspects.
Police teams carried out simultaneous operations to 55 addresses, including 4 wine companies in Istanbul, Edirne, Tekirda<0xC4><0x9F>, Bursa, Bal<0xC4><0xB1>kesir, Manisa, Ayd<0xC4><0xB1>n, Denizli and Nev<0xC5><0x9F>ehir.
In total, 55 people were arrested in the operation, 15 thousand wines ready for sale, 52 thousand 480 wine bottles filled with TAPDK hoodies used many times, 12 thousand 890 TAPDK hoodies, 3 pistols and bullets, 100 boxes of sexually explicit pills, 992 bottles of illegal cigars, and 698 bottles of alcoholic beverages.
The 55 detainees were brought to the Department of Combating Trafficking Crimes on Vatan Street.
Suspects are conducting security proceedings.
The operation of their teams in factories, warehouses and workplaces was reflected in police cameras.
Police searches in a warehouse showed that they were checking out the hoodies found on the ready-to-sell wine bottles.
A police team survey of a bag of TAPDK band-rolled hoodies collected from used bottles was recorded.
How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar’s departure to Paris?
The rules for preventing the unlimited expenditure of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring the world record from Barcelona in Spain to Paris-Saint-Germain in France.
Any result from the prestigious Champions League tournament can come from UEFA, the governing body that controls the European game, to Paris Saint-Germain.
The rules of Financial Fair Play, introduced by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar financed his transfer without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222m ($262m) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will rule a salary of tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some financial aspects of Neymar's trip to France include:
Given the team’s money from the energy-rich Qatari family, PSG could certainly pay Neymar to sign it and add it to the other star galaxy.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they have to balance that with legitimate sources of income, provided they get to the top of their football-related business.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini after he was elected UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that were heavily indebted for success were effectively fraudulent and were at risk of bankruptcy if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, the FFP began monitoring the club’s losses rather than focusing on its debts.
The change meant that the model that Roman Abramovich first used at Chelsea in 2003 (buy a club with the potential, spend a lot to improve the team, and create a global brand) would become a more difficult venture.
During the three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can suffer losses of up to 30m euros.
Although Platini was discreditably removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Cefer, is still determined to give up without overspending.
Andrea Traverso, who manages the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: “The FFP is definitely not dead, and we will definitely strengthen by moving the rules forward.”
Although PSG will pay Neymar’s purchase clause in bulk, it may extend the amount to the contract period for accounting reasons.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a cost of 44.4m euros on its annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP inspections in 2014 saw the implementation of the heaviest inspections to Manchester City, owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was later fined 60m euros ($82m at the time), which was later reduced to 20m euros, and was ordered to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of 25 for the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is wary of clubs that might try to deceive financial regulators by inflating their revenue through companies linked to the club’s owners.
Although a Qatari company can sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship is thought to exceed standard market values, UEFA will not allow it to be counted as a legitimate income.
This was the case in 2014, when the Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that PSG sponsorship had been inflated.
Part of Neymar’s gains from PSG could come through payments from Qatar’s 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
But PSG and Qatar have denied that Neymar will be a World Cup ambassador, and such a move could be easily revealed by UEFA regulators.
Sanctions against PSG in the past mean UEFA will be even more cautious about attempts to bypass the rules.
UEFA said on Tuesday that it is not in a preventive conversation with PSG about Neymar's transfer.
Since they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation, they spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of confidentiality.
Recent accounts show that PSG made more than 10m euros in 2015-16 with a turnover of 542.4m euros.
The accounts for the past fiscal year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to contribute to sponsorship deals, gift and form sales.
The club expects to increase turnover by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league, which was clearly disturbed by the departure of one of the football’s biggest players, tried to prevent Neymar’s departure by claiming that PSG had violated the FFP.
"This is an open case of 'financial doping' with the club and its state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the definitive owner of the PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who owns his own club, an American sports giant, shares his concerns about La Liga being funded by a government.
Wenger said on Thursday: “It’s a result of having and it’s changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years.
“When a country has a club, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect Financial Fair Play because for a country, representing a country by such a big player can lead to different methods or different interests.
Rebellion against insurers’ ceiling price
According to TSB data, the insurance industry has been losing traffic since 2006.
In 2015, the sector suffered losses of TL 2.35 billion, and in 2016, it made a profit of TL 19 million.
Aksigorta, Anadolu Insurance and Güne<0xC5><0x9F> Insurance are being traded in Borsa <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul.
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, speaking at the meeting where the first six-month results of TSB were evaluated in 2017, said that the 11-year damage in traffic insurance reached TL 7.3 billion, with the application of the ceiling premium, the sector's damage will increase to TL 2.3 billion this year and the estimated damage-prime rate to 125 percent.
This year, <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said that the 2015 figure will be captured, noting that the losses in 2012 and 2015 also take away the profits of other branches, "This means that by financing the bad driver, we are also increasing the price of the citizen's housing policy."
“75 percent of the sector is foreign, and our partners abroad are financing the bad driver in a way,” he said.
The ages continued as follows:
We don't expect any profits from traffic, but we can't show that we've made any profits over the past 11 years.
"We accept that, but we continue to hope that we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment, together with other policies," he said.
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, who said that there were dramatic price increases when the traffic loss took the profitability of other products, "In 2012, there were price increases around 30 percent in traffic insurance, almost doubled in 2015, we wrote the biggest loss in our history."
"Even in an environment where prices have risen so much, at the end of 2016, our profit in traffic was only TL 19 million," he said.
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said that they expect to pass the free tariff next year, "We will lower the price of the good driver at the free tariff and impose a high price on the bad driver."
"But the Treasury is looking at the general course, and the Treasury has the final word on when it will be," he said.
The Undersecretariat of Treasury, stating that the rise in mandatory traffic insurance premiums from 2015 has affected a large part of society, has been passed on to the maximum premium (ceiling price) from 12 April.
Accordingly, the maximum premiums for compulsory traffic insurance were determined on the basis of each vehicle group, steps and traffic intensity and accident statistics determined on the basis of the provincial groups.
On the other hand, as of July, the "Pool of Risk Insurers" application has been implemented for the high-frequency of damage in mandatory traffic insurance or vehicle groups.
The premium and damage to traffic insurance policies in the pool will be shared between the insurance companies.
The premium of these insureds will be determined by the Undersecretariat of Treasury.
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said that in the first 6 months of 2017, premium production in traffic decreased by 11.5 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, while the number of policies increased by 4.9 percent to 8.6 million, and the reduction in traffic policies reached about 30 percent, given inflation.
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, who said that traffic will take profits in other branches again this year, said, “This loss cannot be sustained with these ceiling prices.
How much more damage can this sector carry?”
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, who said that the capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, only 2.3 billion TL traffic is lost and the capital of the sector will be finished in three years, <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said, "Why do foreigners finance the good driver the bad driver, why do my thousands of shareholders finance the bad driver in Turkey?"
“At this point, we are trying to explain our problem to the Treasury.”
Following these developments, <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar asked whether foreigners have reached the point of weight reduction in the Turkish insurance sector, "They haven't reached that point yet."
They expect to invest more in Turkey because in the Netherlands, on average, it drops to 6 policies per capita, compared to 1.3 in Turkey.
“So Turkey is a place that really needs to grow,” he said.
So they didn’t give up here.
But even though the company achieves a reasonable profitability every year, it uses all of its profits to grow the company.
According to TSB data, premium production in the sector in 2016 was 40.5 billion TL, compared to the same period last year in the first half of this year increased by 12 percent and amounted to 23.1 billion TL.
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said that the sector predicts that it will not complete the year with 15 percent growth in total premium production.
Thousands of chronic patients receive social assistance
The details and application principles of the "New Social Assistance Program for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases", which started a while ago, were revealed by Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, Minister of Family and Social Policies.
The social assistance program, which will be launched for poor citizens and their families, will benefit 4,300 people with tuberculosis and SSPE in the first phase.
In addition to providing monthly support for more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, patients will also receive regular psychosocial support.
The ministry will also make additional payments to patients with tuberculosis, who are unable to cope with their medical self-care, who live dependent on the bed, or who are identified by the relevant health unit as the need to improve their home living conditions.
Payments will be made through Social Assistance Cards provided through PTT.
Those who cannot go to withdraw money for reasons such as geographic conditions, disease, disability will be paid at the door.
The program is also a first in the world in many ways.
One in 10 German companies to invest in
Prime Minister Arda Ermut, Head of Turkey Investment Support and Promotion Agency, said that the political tension between the two countries is not reflected in the business world as German firms in Turkey are seen as Turkish firms.
"In our relations with Germany, there is not one investor who says, 'We are having trouble with this situation and we are running away'," Ermut said.
"About 10 percent of the projects in our portfolio are from German companies," Ermut said.
Some of them have investments in Turkey.
“Germans make up an important part of our daily workflow,” he said.
Ermut said that Abraaj Group's partnership with the logistics company Netlog is a good example of this.
Abraaj Group Partner Omar Syed pointed to economic growth in Turkey and said, "We have invested a total of $1 billion in Turkey."
<0xC3><0x96>zer, on the way to becoming the last Ottoman
It was reported that the experienced footballer, who gave the administration two weeks to find the club, signed an agreement with Ottomanspor and will sign an official contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of last season, <0xC3><0x96>zer Hurmac<0xC4><0xB1>, who signed with the green-black club until 2019, 4 hours before the end of the transfer, played in 29 leagues, 2 cup matches and made a significant contribution to the team with 5 goals and 4 assists.
The management, which blocked the way back to <0xC3><0x96>zer, signed a deal with Brazilian Sergio Antonio yesterday instead of this player.
The turn of the century has happened!
Barcelona announced Neymar's transfer to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million.
Recently, the transfer development, which the football public opinion has followed with excitement, has become official.
PSG has added the star name to the cast by paying the Catalan team 222 million euros, the player's release fee for the Brazilian player.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in the history of football.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of the French 1st Football League (Ligue 1) has signed a five-year contract with Brazilian star Neymar.
Neymar, a 25-year-old footballer who has been awarded 222m euros to become the world's most expensive footballer, has signed a contract for PSG until June 30, 2022, the club's website said.
Speaking after the signing ceremony, Neymar said he was very happy to be in the French team: “Since I started my football career in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most challenging and ambitious teams.
I have come to this club to join my teammates, to get as many trophies as our fans want.”
PSG will pay Neymar <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45m per season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the representative of France more than 400m euros.
The Marine Workers' Strike is Over
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir Metropolitan Municipality's company <0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z A.<0xC5><0x9E>. and Turkish-<0xC4><0xB0><0xC5><0x9F> subsidiary Turkish Maritime Trade Union (TDS) were unable to reach an agreement on the increase clause in the collective agreement.
The union workers went on strike on July 12th.
The strike, which lasted almost a month, ended today at 15.00 after a workers’ raise.
According to the collective bargaining agreement signed, the salary of the land staff within <0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z will be increased by 12%.
<0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z, which renews its fleet, received an income tax exemption after registration in the International Ship Registry, with its salaries increased by 25 percent, the rate of increase for personnel in shipman status is 5%.
<0xC4><0xB0>ZDEN<0xC4><0xB0>Z General Directorate announced that the operations in the inner bay will continue at normal rates, while Yass<0xC4><0xB1>caada flights will start on Tuesday and Foça and Urla flights will start next week.
TDS President Hasan Pekdemir stated that they have locked up transportation with their 23-day strikes, saying: "The people of <0xC4><0xB0>zmir will be relieved."
As a result of the strike, improvements were made on the rights of our workers on land and at sea.
We leave the table happily.
On average, 28 percent of the pockets working in the sea and 20 percent on land will be included in the pockets.
We also had friends who worked at the minimum wage level.
We have also made significant improvements in their salaries.
Nostalgia is Niche with "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
So, for the characters' bright 80s days, for the grunge era in the 90s (when brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV) and for himself, for 2001, before his stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went on to bigger things, this version of the story is nostalgic for all of them.
As a cultural product, it’s both an embodiment and an embodiment of our era of Facebook with permanent memories.
But as a series, it's like it's expired.
The "First Day of Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and it wasn't just because of its absurd humor (it contained a story about the origins of a talking box of plants voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).
By concentrating on the main comic (playing the older middle-aged actors in the age of puberty) he realized the impossibility of recapitulating the past part of the joke.
His parody is more arbitrary, including the less emotionally based "Ten Years Later", where adults are now playing adults, and the monologue about the 90s stalker film, like "The Hand That Shakes the cradle."
At one point, the character mixes an Apple Powerbook, some single row roller skates, and "a lot of other things from 1991."
Many of the main stories are the same.
Coop (Mr. Showalter) is now a writer, still unable to forget Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
There’s also another crazy treacherous plot involving Ronald Reagan (again Mr. Showalter), a very well-spoken imitation by George H. W. Bush.
The best part of the series, as usual, is the words.
It's especially nice to see the young Mr. Rudd, who's always got his under-the-lip beard in Matt Dillon's "The Singles," whose Andy, the most popular boy in the old school, now looks like an old man.
There may be moments of random insanity that power this series (e.g., a kind of recurrent "Seven Up!" series) until I reach what I think is the logical result: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", which is the final scene where the band goes to see the premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: "The Americans"' Cold War resurrecting, the film "Blonde Bomb", and even "GLOW" with its iconography of Eastern, Western wrestling.
Created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, the comedy directed by Rhys Thomas looks like the found TV: a 1980s Romanian police friends drama in which two Bucharest police officers fight for the real, atheism and Marxist-Leninist path.
The lead roles are played by wolf Gregor and idealist Iosef, Florin Pieric Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, with English dubbed Channing Tatum (both executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice visual comics (Americans watch football while cops spend time watching chess on TV)
Celebrity voice cast, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, is a good material for the “who knows who’s voice” game.
But "Comrade Detective" is so devoted to the simulation of a clumsy propaganda drama (including a Reagan-masked killer) that he often plays just like him.
Six long episodes don’t know how to pass, and comedy isn’t quick enough or often enough.
While Gregor and Iosef regularly visited the American embassy, where there were two fat men who always ate a pile of hamburgers in their lobby, the “Comrade Detective” could have done much better if it had been reduced to a narrower length.
The message to the imaginary communist viewer is that Western culture can turn anything into food that will eat it in a series.
The fictional Romanian creators are not wrong: we are doing this to our own recent past and even to theirs.
The Founding Fathers of Fethullah Gülen
After fifty years of experience, the British government has found our family loyal and selfless.
The supreme authorities of the government have acknowledged that this family has long been sincerely committed to the British Government and has been of great service.
It is necessary for the British Government to act wisely and carefully about this seedling planted with their own hands, to investigate and carefully examine everything and to decide.
When trying to understand FET<0xC3><0x96>, the organization of Hashish as the starting point is taken into consideration, but a crucial difference that is forgotten is that FET<0xC3><0x96> is an organization that emerged during the imperialist period and acted with colonial motives.
In my opinion, the “premium” movement to be addressed in this miniature is the women’s.
In the English praise at the entrance, the person who describes himself as a 'sprout planted by the hands of the British Government' is Mirza Gulam Ahmet Kadiyani, the founder of Kadiyanilik.
"On December 1, 1888, Gulam Ahmed, a small town in Punjab, India, reported that God had ordered him to take vows from his followers and establish a separate congregation."
Gulam Ahmed went a little further and said that in 1891, according to the revelations and inspirations he received, Jesus b. Mary died of a natural death like the other prophets, and God sent him as the Messiah and Messiah that Christians and Muslims await.
According to this, the Messiah and the Mahdi are the same people that Muslims expect, and this is Mirza Gulam Ahmed Qadiyani.
(Encyclopedia of Islam, TDV)
In India, which became completely under British rule after the 1857 Sipahi uprising, Gulam Ahmed, who wrote books defending the persecuted Muslims against the Hindus and Christians, is believed to have been founded with purely sanctifying motives, but the CIA support later emerged.
Like Gülen, Gulam Ahmed’s most beloved idea by the imperialists is that “jihad” is a struggle of Muslims only with their own self and that imperialism has no dimension to fight if you can live your religion freely.
In fact, if you remember, Gülen went one step further, praising even the attacks of the Crusaders in our history, which are still open, in a sermon last year: “It is not too dangerous for the Crusaders to invade your country.
There are red lines between you and them.
They will not be your wife or your daughter.
They don't touch the temple, the untamed Crusaders!
Apart from the similarity of theses with FET<0xC3><0x96>, the idea that the Mahdi and the Messiah are united in themselves, that their community will be the savior of Islam, that the concept of jihad means only self-defense, and that the spread of Kad<0xC4><0xB1>y<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>t in general has taken place in the field of education and civil society.
The total number of Kadiyani centers in the world, which is said to be more than 2 million, is 1869, and the number of countries in which the emergency organization "Humanity First" is officially registered is 23.
In addition, there are 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispensaries in 55 countries, 8 women’s prints in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and about 16,000 mosques around the world.
If we consider that the Nobel laureate Prof. Abd al-Salam, the first Muslim scientist, Sir Zaferullah Khan, the President of the United Nations Court of Justice, and Mahershala Ali, the "first Muslim Oscar-winning actor", are Qadiyani, we can see more clearly the depth of global powers' approval of the Qadiyani.
It should be noted that the meeting of the Kad<0xC4><0xB1>n<0xC4><0xB1>nites in England last week with 30,000 people was also polished as a body show.
A brief look at their history is enough to understand that the Kadiyani, one of their slogans, “Love everyone, hate no one,” actually means “Love your invaders/colonies.”
It is possible to extend the origin and motivation of structures such as FET<0xC3><0x96> or Tahir al-Qadri to the Kadiyani, and all of these organizations are in fact supported by the fact that they are committed to corrupting societies in order to serve imperialism and colonialism.
The "Last Wish" of the Cargo
Emily Pomeranz (50), who spent her final days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, expressed her longing for a coffee and chocolate-mixed milkshake (milk drink) from a restaurant in her hometown.
A friend of hers contacted the owner of a restaurant called Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has run the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink on dry ice and paid $123 ($435) for it, sending it to a hospital 600 kilometers away with a "fast delivery" cargo.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
Ahmet Kul Construction, which has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, has launched the Dia Mare projects in Mimaroba, Istanbul, and Solse 7 projects in Yal<0xC4><0xB1>kavak.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project, developed by <0xC3><0x87>amo<0xC4><0x9F>lu Architecture, was developed to get the maximum benefit from the sea.
Situated on an area of 11,000 square meters, Dia Mare has a total of 188 residential and 17 commercial units.
The project, which is completely finished with the rough structure, will begin to be delivered to new owners in March 2018.
Dia Mare has many types of apartments ranging from 2<0x2B>1 to 5<0x2B>1.
The company, which will launch two new construction sites in Mimaroba and Bitez this year, is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkap<0xC4><0xB1> in 2018.
753 million to shareholders.
Bar<0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F> Yarka<0xC5><0x9F>a<0xC5><0x9F> said that many programs were built outside of TRT, where 6 thousand 760 personnel were employed and hepatological prices were paid.
The CHP's deputy, "TRT 2016", again turned the nation's taxes to AKP companies.
"It's called a robbery," he said.
The source, which TRT transferred to the side-production companies, was revealed with data from official documents.
The official response of the CHP Istanbul MP Bar<0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F> Yarka<0xC5><0x9F>a<0xC5><0x9F> to the application within the framework of the Information Act revealed how TRT's resources are being spent.
Yarka<0xC5><0x9F>a<0xC5><0x9F> said that 6,760 people worked as a staff member at TRT, despite all kinds of technical facilities, 753 million 500 thousand TL was transferred to partner companies in 2016 through programs built under the name of external construction.
The CHP’s deputy said, “This means a hit.”
Bar<0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F> Yarka<0xC5><0x9F>a<0xC5><0x9F>, “The production companies of AKP journalists and businessmen are plundering TRT.”
"Millions are being paid for untraceable or untraceable productions," he said.
Recalling that the money transferred to the companies was collected from the taxes of the people, Yarkada<0xC5><0x9F> said, "The institution with 7,000 staff has turned into the barley of AKP."
“What programs did these companies sign that 7,000 people couldn’t do and they took this money?”
Announcing that TRT's advertising revenue in 2016 was TL 224.456.182, Yarka<0xC5><0x9F>a<0xC5><0x9F> stated that advertising revenue remains a huge asset when staff salaries and other expenses are taken into account.
"TRT, which became the voice of the AKP, cannot receive advertising because it is not being watched."
Feeding journalists take money from TRT, screaming on behalf of the AKP.
He said, “The people are carrying the burden.”
CHP’s Yarkada<0xC5><0x9F> continued: “TRT pays TL 660 million per year to the staff; but it gives all the work to external productions.”
753,5 trillion supporters have been withdrawn from TRT, that is, from the pockets of the public.
That's a total disgrace.
He gave up suicide, knelt down in front of his wife and apologized.
The incident took place in a parking lot in Eyupo<0xC4><0x9F>lu Neighborhood De<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>rmen Street at noon today.
According to the information obtained, the residents of the surrounding area who saw the citizen hanging down from the 4th floor of the parking lot reported the situation to fire departments and medical teams.
While firefighters arrived at the scene to open the tarpaulin to the area where the person was located, medical teams were also ready.
Yunus G., a 34-year-old father of three, who refused to commit suicide after nearly an hour of persuasion efforts by the psychologists and police teams who were called to the scene, knelt in front of his wife N.G. who watched him in tears and apologized.
On the other hand, about 100 people were watching the situation on the sidewalks on the street where Yunus G., who was attempting to commit suicide, while some citizens recorded it on their mobile phones.

Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will not change soon after slow economic growth and speculation of an increase in moving inflation.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue "slowly" as the family's incomes contracted and they kept their interest rates steady.
Decision makers on the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, so that fewer members wanted to increase this month after slow economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank raised its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018, warning that household incomes would continue to shrink, with inflation still expected to grow close to 3% in the spring.
However, he signaled that interest rates rises are necessary to restrain inflation fueled by Brexit over the next few years, and that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw some of the massive economic recovery package launched a year ago after Brexit.
The bank will end its periodic funding plan, offering low-cost financing to banks from next February, but expects it to offer more than <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>115 billion in total) as part of the plan.
Minutes after the interest decision was made, the bank said: "The MPC's central estimate is that gross domestic product (GDP) continues to be slow in the short term as the shrinkage of domestic real income continues to be a burden on consumption."
Regarding interest rates, he stressed that “a bit of contraction in monetary policy” may be necessary to mitigate inflation and that the market will be “a bit higher” than expected.
Markets are still forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank emphasizes that any increase will be “step by step” and “limited.”
According to May’s forecasts, the bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to 1.9 percent and 1.7 percent.
The bank maintains its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound lost value against the dollar and the euro after the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change came after the disappointing recent growth figures lightened expectations for increased growth, with GDP reaching 0.2% in the previous three months compared to 0.3% in the second quarter.
Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but the bank says it will start to grow slightly by the end of the year.
While the bank says that the contraction will worsen before it improves, the latest inflation report leaves little to cheer for households hit by increased inflation and small wage increases.
The bank said its monetary policy could not "block" revenues in the next few years, but expects salaries to improve "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecasts.
Increased demand for British goods as a result of weak pounds will support the economy by balancing some of the declining consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates fell to 0.25% in August following the shocking EU referendum vote, which led to the pound upside down.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully affect prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's most recent interest decision, there was a demand for an increase in inflationary pressure on hard-working households and a rise in interest rates, with three policymakers calling for an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The bank said the vaccine, according to their 2% target, was about "completely" weak pounds.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent declines in exchange rates, while lenders have a demand to do business and close the year in a positive way, the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive.
The market looks particularly good for those who are nearing the end of their current contracts, with many free options and low interest rates becoming more popular than ever.”
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Following a struggle to finance the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to access 'converter' HIV prevention treatment starting in September.
The NHS UK has announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex, will be provided to an estimated 10,000 people through a 3-year preliminary trial, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 percent.
The Supreme Court's decision last year agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal's approval. The ruling said the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP, despite claims of local authorities funding it.
The move, announced Thursday, was welcomed as a "new and serious intervention" by NHS UK president Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to register the public, with more clinics participating in October to be fully implemented throughout the UK until April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a series of HIV medications that reduce the risk of getting HIV before sex.
Experiments showed that PrEP significantly reduced HIV transmission among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means having enough drugs in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection from spreading.
These medications can be taken every day or up to two hours before having sex.
Suitable for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
The clinics will identify the appropriate participants who will agree to the experiment from men, women, transgender individuals, and unknown individuals whose partners’ HIV status is controlled with anti-retroviral therapy.
Individuals residing in the UK who are registered with a practitioner can also register for potential participation in participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS UK has signed an agreement to provide medicines this week with an international bid.
The trial was designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, conducted, and applied on a large scale.
Mr Stevens said: “This new and serious intervention will contribute to a broad and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.
This is yet another milestone in thirty years of development to overcome one of humanity’s major health problems.”
Deborah Gold, head of the National Aids Trust, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If targeted correctly for those in need and those at risk, PrEP offers the possibility of transforming the HIV epidemic in the UK.
Starting in September, people with high HIV risk will reach a new and powerful vehicle in the UK through this NHS-funded experiment, which is truly individually controlled and unnecessarily negotiable with a partner, which will lead to the recovery of many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly.”
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority right now should be to ensure that the experiment is delivered quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP experimental drug is available, we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Public Health Minister, said: “We welcome the start of the PrEP experiment, and months of delay followed by the government’s stance.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our vision of HIV prevention and how it can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
The experiment will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this experiment be presented nationwide as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in the community.

Two Secrets of Death
<0xC3><0x9C>mit Makbule <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, the daughter of former Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who was born in Washington, D.C. (51), died after falling from the 19th floor of a business center in <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul Levent.
A 24-year-old student from Koç University, Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu, was also found dead in her home.
It is said that Salihoglu hanged himself.
Two secrets that were followed and were considered suicides by the police have been investigated.
"There was a depressing time."
<0xC3><0x9C>mit Makbule <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, the daughter of the first Minister of Industry and Trade of Turkey, Ayhan <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who served in the Nihat Erim government in 1971, was born in Washington, D.C., on 1 August at 17:00, entered Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler.
An ambulance and police team were called to the scene after a Kuwaiti tourist who had settled in the room on the 19th floor and saw the dead body of <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who had not been heard from him for a while, informed the hotel management.
The medical team determined that <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who fell from the 19th floor to the hard ground, lost his life.
The mother who testified to the police, Mediha <0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, said, “He had been depressed recently.”
He arrived in Istanbul from Ankara on July 31.
I have a granddaughter with leukemia from my other daughter.
“He was taking care of my granddaughter and was negatively affected by my granddaughter’s illness,” she said.
<0xC3><0x87>ilingiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, whose funeral has been postponed to Forensic Medicine Institution, is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It is being investigated whether he was fired by someone or committed suicide.
The 'Canina Kiydi' Claim
The other suspected death in Istanbul occurred in Sar<0xC4><0xB1>yer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu (24), who studied at Koç University, was found dead in his home.
It is alleged that the young girl's father went to her daughter's house near the school, where she had no news and could not reach her cell phone.
The father found his daughter’s dead body at home.
It was claimed that Melis, who was very loved by his family, close circles and friends, had ended his life by hanging himself at his house.
Melis Saliho<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s death drowned his family and relatives.
Following Melis, a friend posted on social media, “A bright sun was hitting our face.”
We had fun chasing the lush grass under our feet, chasing after that little plastic ball with your best friend Jack and your sister Eyshan.
He shared his message: “There is no need to die now.”
Living a luxurious life: Mezzanine and smart design tricks have turned this little Earls Courts apartment into a spacious home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate remodeling, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
It’s on the first floor of a fancy Queen Anne-style terrace, and it’s a testament to the new design that Joanne is convinced not to pack her bags.
“Before that, I lived in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my ex,” says Joanne.
“I was looking for something for my price.
The apartment at Earl Court was shown to me and they had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with him and made an offer that day.”
After the first sight, the 1000 square feet apartment was completely renovated.
It was originally a one-room and complex planned property; you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne wanted to add a storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows and a lot of light.
That was my condition,” he said.
To this end, he hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck <0x26> Shed to take advantage of the 12.5 ft ceiling and create not only a structure but also a place where Joanne would live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine floor in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
"The steel skeleton is quite complicated," he explains.
“We had to adjust the gaps so that they could stack up without needing to lean down on each other.
This was not only to build a simple platform, but the steels would bend in such a way that they would be at the right height according to the top or bottom function.”
This arrangement brought many additional dramas, allowing Erfan to get two full-sized rooms on top of each other.
The old type of copper light window from Retrouvius for mezzanine overlooks the magnificent living space below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver highlights, and the old-fashioned Serge Mouille lighting all determine the style of the draft.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of space, space, and light.
The mirrors placed at both ends of the short hallway make it look longer.
The mirrored guard panel in the kitchen gives the feeling of a window opening into another room.
The mirrored units in the yard provide storage space for all of Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The beauty of the living room, which creates a more spectacular sense of space, is to be able to close the kitchen when it is not in use.
Open and close kitchens are not new.
What is unique about this is that it has a liftable door in the style of a garage.
"We used a bit of engineering in this," Erfan explains the steel reinforced polished MDF door.
"It's a balance weight, so when you push the door up, it slides really easily."
With the wise use of space and storage space, Joanne has earned an additional 16 square meters, an extra bedroom and an improved session plan.
“At the end of the day, the seating area is what you sell, or the value of your property is determined,” Erfan says.
"In principle, a real estate agent will come in and do a calculation based on the seating area."
While increasing the floor area here, they managed to use quality material that gives the area its luxurious appearance.
"Materials are objects you touch, and they help you build emotional bonds at home," Erfan says.
"At home, you don't fall in love with the power lines on the wall.
They are important, but they don’t shake the strings of your heart.”
This is proof that through good design and increased square meters, an apartment can be transformed from a standard to something quite spectacular.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.
Jeremain Lens Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F>
At the end of the 1.5-month negotiations, he was transferred to Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> with a Lens bond initially considered to be a rental.
Following a week of intensive talks, Lens agreed with the black-and-white team for a fee of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 million.
The Dutch player, who signed a five-year deal, will receive 2.2 million euros a year.
Besiktas is expected to make an official statement about the transfer of Jeremain Lens.
Wedding photos of famous couples
<0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>la <0xC5><0x9E>ikel, a model who has been in a high-rise relationship for about 4 years, and Emre Altu<0xC4><0x9F>, an actor and singer, entered the world house in Sortie.
The couple immortalized the wedding ceremony, which they called "the most special moment of our lives" with a photo taken.
The couple separated seven years later.
Brothers fighting for $500 million property empire
The two brothers are at war for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million, four decades after the Italian families’ dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives in a mansion in Toorak, three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who gave himself up to the Supreme Court on how to divide property and business assets.
Paul had wanted to quit the family business since 2014, but there was a fierce debate at the Supreme Court over the split.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties in Smith Street, Collingwood, worth more than half a billion dollars since they bought a store in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and raised it to a chain with 160 retail centers.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in the property, and De Lutis’s portfolio currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contractor sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Under an agreement with their deceased father, Colin (described by Paul as a "significant driving force and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns one-third.
A court file says it means Colin has $316 million and Paul has $176 million worth of property.
For Paul, dividing property and cash is a contentious issue.
In his first sworn statement to the court in 2015, he wrote: “The dividends proposed by Colin left him with what I always considered the best.”
Last Friday was the first Supreme Court hearing after many failed mediation.
The brothers are also fighting over who will control the current job; Paul claims that Colin has left him out of it.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some property.
Colin said in a sworn statement that he hoped to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots dictate to me that family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails, and top lawyers like Allan Myers, QC, and senior legal advisers hired by both parties, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, are on the rise in the case.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were an Italian immigrant family who operated groceries and deliries from the late 1950s and had bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They had pledged their property to buy the Collingwood estate where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says that “in my last years in high school, when Paul was a little boy (at 10 years old)” he founded Westco there.
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hope to leave their property to their son in a friendly way.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court,” he wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies; Colin says Mark was paid $10 million and Luke was paid $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark "were dissatisfied with the terms of their financial separation."
According to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star, Colin tried not to draw attention, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with a text message, he replied, "I can't say much."
"It was very, very sad that my brother Paul had chosen to sue me and drag the name of our family to the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court application that he was trying to fulfill his brother's demands.
"Our father would not want us to fall into the current conflict," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful about the solution."
This hope seems lost on Friday.
"Our problem will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the president’s media diet.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly could really do that.
If so, it'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief will limit the flow of information (including news media reports) to President Trump in the hopes of keeping the boss more stable.
Here's some information from reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new chief of staff of the White House, met with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a fundamental problem that President Donald Trump planned to solve with regard to the White House: the transfer of bad information into the president’s hands.
Kelly told the staff that information should flow over itself, whether on paper or with briefings, because the president would be able to make better decisions when good information was given.
Kelly’s diagnosis made a lot of sense, but others tried to tame Trump by overseeing the media diet and failed.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades, and he’s now in the White House, and his habit of watching TV is still in good shape.
A former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February: “If candidate Trump is upset that he didn’t get a fair spot in the media, it would be a yield booster to show him that he found a fair spot in the media that could be persuaded.”
Politico’s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time, “According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit in check was to ensure that personal media consumption included a steady stream of praise.”
Oh, okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit is “under control” at any given time is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something the rest of us don’t know, such as that Trump’s tweets would be far more provocative without their intervention.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his staff were able to get him out of danger a few times, then his efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem was that the White House was made up of competing factions, people who, in any case, tried to advance their agendas with the materials they presented to Trump (which could be credible or unreliable) and put forward their own worldview.
In May, Politico reported that throughout the entire story, advisers had a tendency to strategically communicate suspicious information to the president.
This is an example of what reporter Shane Goldmacher described in detail:
“Current and former Trump officials say Trump has reacted furiously to negative clippings from the press, especially the leaks that have had a bad impact, and is obsessed with finding out where they came from.
At the end of February, someone deliberately handed over to the president a printed copy of an article from the website GotNews.com of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson accusing deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the "source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It didn’t matter whether Johnson was banned from Twitter permanently for harassment, or if he didn’t provide any concrete evidence, or if he had made false accusations in the past and turned away from them.
“Trump read the article and started asking staff questions about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that then-Special Secretary Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter were "trying to install a system that manages and documents the documents Trump received."
How did that work?
Kelly's trying to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will emerge as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own impulsive state and his aides are still competing for influence.
These immutable factors will make Kelly's mission quite difficult.
Crypto FET<0xC3><0x96>"operators revealed with special template
<0xC4><0xB0>zmir Public Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya has completed his investigation after the secret witness with the code name "Sava<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>", the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Tumamiral jihat Yayc<0xC4><0xB1>, said that he was a FET<0xC3><0x96>.
In the review, it was emphasized that, unlike Tümamiral Yayc<0xC4><0xB1>, he was not a member of the organization, he helped the investigative authority in deciphering the members of the crypto organization under the Command of the Navy and played an active role in the fight against FET<0xC3><0x96>.
The decision, which pointed out that Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> was trying to be pacified in the coup attempt on July 15 by the so-called martial law order by the command of the Navy Command, underlined that Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> has been actively fighting against FET<0xC3><0x96> since the first day of the coup attempt.
The following statements were used in the follow-up decision made by Karakaya: "It is understood that Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> has been working on the determination of the personnel of the Krypto Naval Forces Command thanks to the special template for the identification of members of the Krypto-private services class and the special system created on 64 basic criteria and 209 sub-criterias."
A preliminary, private and stubborn effort has been observed in the judicial investigations, there is no evidence of the name other than the afaki and unfounded statement of the secret witness, and as a result of the struggle, it has been concluded that it is impossible to evaluate a predictive assessment on the Sagittarius, which is known as an active anti-terrorist organization and which has great contributions in this direction, by our chief prosecutor’s.
Admiral Sagittarius has previously been charged with insults.
It turned out that the FET<0xC3><0x96> fighters were behind this, and the alleged crime was plotted.
The former Air Force Chief of Staff Colonel Hakan Dinç, who complained that Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> insulted him, was the former Adana Incirlik 10, who only translated the complaint in the form of information notes into documents.
Tanker Base Commander Air Pilot Brigadier General Bekir Ercan Van, former General Counsel of the General Staff who gave permission for the investigation, Colonel Muharrem Köse, former General Mustafa <0xC3><0x96>zsoy of the General Staff of the General Staff who was in the Investigation Committee, former Lieutenant General Mustafa <0xC3><0x96>zsoy who was in contact with the Chief of the General Staff who was in the Investigation Committee, former Lieutenant Commander Major Major and former Lieutenant Colonel, former Serge Command Commander, former Sergeant, former Serge Command Command Commander.
It turned out that some members of the organization, including FETO fugitive Tuncay Opchin, were targeting Yayc<0xC4><0xB1> with their posts on social media before and after the coup attempt on July 15.
Travellers cross the ditch, return to 'rich neighborhood'
Some of West Midlands’ wealthiest homeowners are once again in a fight with tenacious travelers who cross the ditch dug by the council to reclaim the area outside their mansions.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans outside a well-built Solihull street known as the 'Rich Neighborhood'.
They did not hesitate to jump from the ditch the council had dug to cut off their influx, but returned after they had just been fired in May, bringing babies and loads of wagons.
The cleverly moving group found a gap in defense, leaking their vehicles in by setting a path through a section that was left without barricades.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council, saying it was "unhelpful in solving the problem."
An anonymous resident said: “They arrived there Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The council should be ashamed of their actions because they're useless in solving the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were sent out, and now they come back.
There were more coming last night, and probably more coming today.”
He added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with the long suspension decisions taken to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Street and I’m not happy to continue paying my taxes when the council can’t even stop it.”
A resident who did not want to give his name said: “Like a joke, we saw that the last group of travelers had just left, and we were immediately devastated by a new group.
This time their number had increased, and a horse was even seen grazing in the parking lot.
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: “We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on Streetsbrook Street’s land, and we will begin legal proceedings as soon as possible to expel them from there.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible call 101 to report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help bring out the picture of the situation so that the court will consider when we present our case to the court.”
Galatasaray reported Ndiaye to the stock market
According to a statement sent to Borsa <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul from Galatasaray Sportive Industrial and Commercial Investments Inc. and featured on the Public Lighting Platform, the yellow-red club will pay <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.500,000 for the footballer's bonanza fee to Otmosmanspor, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750,000 if he plays a total of 25 matches in the league, cup and Europe, and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750,000 if he plays another game.
Galatasaray will pay Ndiaye a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11m guarantee fee, including <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>750,000 per year.
In addition, Ndiaye will receive a bonus of 5,000 euros for each point of the yellow-red team in the matches of the TFF Süper Lig and UEFA competitions.
The player is also entitled to a unilateral termination of the contract for 18m euros as of June 15, 2019.
The last day is alarming!
They went to the fire stations.
Thousands of vehicles were damaged by the storm and hail in Istanbul last Thursday.
While many of the drivers who received reports from the fire department to cover the damages by the insurance companies made their notifications, drivers who had not received reports so far were in line for the report.
Drivers who are not informed today came to the fire stations and requested a report due to the fact that this is the last day of the notice period.
Today is the last day
Drivers first had firefighters take pictures of their vehicles to detect the damage to their vehicles.
Drivers whose vehicles were damaged were later reported to the authorities.
Hasan Erol, who came to the fire station for the report, said, “I have registered and I will take a photo.”
There was intensity when I arrived.
"There was damage to the front window," he said.
The driver said, “We’re running.”
We're in line.
We took a picture.
“We’re going to wait for the report,” he said.
The skyscrapers with walls on land and sea don't mind breathing
CHP Councillor Nadir Ataman warned about the huge buildings rising on the beach and said: "The expert report in the case clearly says that these structures will not be able to withstand earthquakes of magnitude 6."
It is stated that the piles where the solid rock is 25-30 meters below are not excavated so deep.
The high-rise hotels and residences that weave walls between sea and land on the Istanbul Ataköy beach left the district breathless.
Nadir Ataman, Member of the Council of Bakirköy Municipality of CHP, reacted to the giant shopping malls, hotels and residential projects that rose one after the other in the district.
Ataman pointed out that the buildings on the beach cut the wind, "80 years ago, those who planned according to the wind formed the Atatürk Forest in Florya.
80 years later, what kind of urban understanding was reached, giant skyscrapers planted in wind corridors and changed the climate.
He said, “He’s not breathing.”
Ataman, who stated that the buildings that rise like a wall on the Ataköy coast change the balance of the climate, continued: "The temperature is felt 10 degrees higher because of the skyscrapers."
These buildings need to be built according to the direction of the wind.
But our skyscrapers rise above Istanbul's wind corridors.
The wind can't get into the county.
These structures are disrupting the balance of natural life.
Ataman said that these skyscrapers, which are harmful to the environment and human health, also cut off the connection of the people of Bak<0xC4><0xB1>rköy with the sea, and said that they would appeal to the Council of Monuments on the subject and go to the way of justice.
It's possible to cure hair loss without surgery.
In cases where phenol is administered, up to 83 percent success is seen.
In this method, the diseased tissue is effectively cleaned and the tissue cavity is filled with an agent that kills the hair follicles.
Another of the non-surgical hair rotation treatment techniques is the laser method.
With various lasers, the hair follicles and the tissue around them are burned by circular emitting rays, and during this combustion, the tissues are glued to close.
Thanks to these two non-surgical methods of hair loss disease, patients can return to their social and work lives in a shorter time.
Dr. Mert Atak stated that excessive weight, sedentary life, long-term sitting work, dense hair and not complying with the rules of hygiene caused hair to turn, and noted that the symptoms of the disease include pain in the tail, infection, abscess and swelling.
Italy hardens NGOs’ approach to migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean Sea that if they do not comply with the new rules affecting their operations, they will not be allowed to continue.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new regulation, it will be difficult to see them continue to operate," Interior Minister Marco Minniti told Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a boat operated by the German relief agency Jugend Rettet, suspected that its crew was actively cooperating with human traffickers to facilitate illegal migration.
The charity, which has only been active for a year, declined to comment on the content of the detailed charges brought against them by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“Saving human lives is and will be our top priority for us, so we’re very sorry we can’t work in the search and rescue area right now.”
"Only after we have gathered all the information and made an assessment of the situation can we assess the allegations that are currently being made."
Italian authorities have been tracking the young Rettet’s boat, Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that the crew took a pack of migrants into the boat, which were delivered directly to them by human smugglers, and allowed the smugglers to escape on boats for reuse.
According to the prosecutor's files, which were published by Italian media, at least one such meeting was alleged to have taken place 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast.
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian coast guard, who oversees rescue operations in the area because of humanitarian efforts rather than any other purpose.
According to the regulations, boats like Iuventa were supposed to have an Italian police officer on board, who was clearly monitoring their activities.
Of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations, only three have so far agreed to comply with the regulation: Save the Children, Malta-based MOAS, and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said Tuesday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because it would not cause any "serious changes or obstacles" to its own rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescues in recent weeks is indicative of fruitful efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local governors.
The minister said: “We have recently begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel.”
This month, he announced plans to hold more talks with Libyan governors on economic development initiatives and to take measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving Chad, Niger and Mali in hopes of reaching Europe.
Last-minute punch!
In Moscow, the capital of Russia, every year in celebration of the "Day of paratrooper troops", watermelon was beaten and vodka was drunk.
He attacked Nikita Razvozjayev, a Russian NTV correspondent who was broadcast live in a Russian Gorki Park that was involved in the event and had been drinking heavily.
In a live broadcast, the reporter warned the man who suddenly appeared and shouted, "We will take over Ukraine", "Please shut up."
The drunk man, who was said to be a former paratrooper, struck him hard at the reporter’s warning.
Surprised by the punch he received, the reporter tried to get away from the man.
Millions of people watched the shock on live television.
the Economic Coordination Board
The Economic Coordination Board (ECC) met under the chairmanship of Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek, the deputy prime minister responsible for the economy.
The EKK meeting, which was held for the first time under the presidency of <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek after the cabinet change in the government, began at 18.30 in <0xC3><0x87>ankaya Mansion.
Turkey's macroeconomic outlook will be discussed at the meeting.
The meeting, led by <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek, was attended by Finance Minister Naci Agbal, Science, Industry and Technology Minister Faruk <0xC3><0x96>zlü, Labour and Social Security Minister Julied Sar<0xC4><0xB1>ero<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Customs and Trade Minister Bülent Tüfenkci, Development Minister Lütfi Elvan, Treasury Undersecretary Osman <0xC3><0x87>elik, Central Bank President Murat Cetinkaya and the relevant bureaucrats.
How to Get Rid of a Waist Hernia in 45 Minutes
Assoc. Dr. O<0xC4><0x9F>uz Karaemino<0xC4><0x9F>ullar<0xC4><0xB1>, who pointed out that only 5 percent of patients should be operated in the treatment of lumbar hernia, says, "The first step according to the results of the examination and imaging of the patient is rest and drug treatment."
O<0xC4><0x9F>uz Karaemino<0xC4><0x9F>lu stated that interventional methods (e.g., epidural injections, radiofrequency techniques, in-disc interventions) should be tried especially in the patient group where the pain continues, "If success is not achieved from all these methods, lethargy and weakness in the legs become obvious, then surgery becomes mandatory".
Karaeminog<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1> stated that the ‘full closed back hernia surgery’, which minimizes the risk today, also allows patients to reduce their reservations about surgery, which cannot be achieved by interventional methods, and says that it is possible to get rid of back hernia disease in 45 minutes:
Although microscopic surgery is quite good compared to open surgery, after the operation, there may be some complications such as long recovery period, adherence to the spinal cord, recurrence of hernia and waist shift and infection that may develop in the future.
Microscopic surgery is often described as ‘closed surgery’, but microscopic surgery is applied with the same approach as open surgery.
In full closed lumbar hernia surgery, these risks are eliminated as the surrounding tissues are protected.
The full closed spinal hernia surgery takes only 45 minutes.
Special Commission at work
The Commission will include CHP MPs Mehmet Gökda<0xC4><0x9F>, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Peace Yarkada<0xC5><0x9F> and Turan Aydo<0xC4><0x9F>an, High Disciplinary Board Member.
Commission, Berbero<0xC4><0x9F>lu's 14th Istanbul on October 4th.
He will also follow his trial in the High Criminal Court and the applications made to the Constitutional Court and the District Court of Appeals.
CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyay Sindir and Deputy President Bülent Tezcan's signature included in the assignment, "The judiciary is independent and impartial, and it is an indispensable condition of justice that it does not receive orders from anywhere except the law."
"Our MP, Mr. Enis Berbero<0xC4><0x9F>lu, did not demand any special status while serving as a deputy, did not seek refuge in the armor of immunity recognized by his deputy, and wanted to maintain his faith in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary."
The prosecution argued that the court prefers to follow political orders rather than proceedings.
Although the Constitutional Court found the arrests of lawmakers inaccurate, the decision to arrest before the verdict was a clear proof that the court had taken a decision under the influence.
Michelle Carter Sentenced to Penalty for Messages Encouraging Conrad Roy to Suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted on June 13, 2014, of the murder of his own suicide, Conrad Roy.
Mr. Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family's heart is broken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter's been allowed to go free, with his way of appeal open.
He faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but his legal team argued that both he and Mr. Roy suffered from mental illness.
Wearing red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter was punished with tears in his eyes, his hands clenched and his eyes looking down at the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
He ended his life to heal his own.
He did not accept responsibility,” he said.
"He showed no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a terrible situation in which he regretted it all."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he had not seen "any significant effect on his actions by age, maturity, or even mental illness."
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr. Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "There is no day I cannot mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I've overcome everything, and I'm trying to be there for his sisters with all the pain we're going to carry forever."
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that the reality that he could never attend his brother's wedding, or that he could never have been to his children, "is not out of his mind."
"It's a pain that the person you've been with every day since I was born is no longer with me for the rest of my life."
There's no Massachusetts law that criminalizes telling a person to commit suicide, so the case seems to be going to court.
Carter was 17 when Mr. Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention when it was revealed that Carter's text messages encouraged him to end his own life.
While she was on vacation with her parents, she sent several messages two weeks before her death, saying, "Hold yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there's a lot of roads."
In the moments before his suicide, he wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz instructed not to be allowed to take advantage of the case through the press, saying that Carter wanted to attract attention through Mr. Roy's death.
The case divided legal opinion.
Among the minority that defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of killing her British roommate in Italy in 2007, two years before she was acquitted.
Mrs. Knox (30) published an article in the Los Angeles Times stating: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
Mehmet <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek's dramatic growth forecast
In his statement, <0xC5><0x9E>im<0xC5><0x9F>ek stated that inflation in Turkey should be reduced to low one-digit numbers and that food inflation constitutes a "risk area".
The deputy prime minister predicts inflation will fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his lightning speech, he said:
The next 12 months are critical for the reduction of uncertainty.
The biggest incentive is to reduce uncertainty.
We have a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope that the uncertainty in our nearby geography will also decrease.
By increasing our resistance to shocks with some reforms, I believe that we will put Turkey on a growth trend above 5 percent.
I said it months ago.
The worst of it is left behind.
Gradually, not to those areas of our energy, but to reforms that will enable our energy to grow inclusively and increase employment.
The next 12 months are critical.
On the one hand, reform, on the other hand, where uncertainty is reduced, there is already no political uncertainty.
Hopefully, we will be able to reduce the number of problems in our nearest geography.
Whether we like it or not, many of our classic markets have collapsed.
Libya, like Iraq.
We’re not just losing on Sunday, we’re facing a wave of over 3.5 million migrations.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we have solid foundations problems.
Now, with some reforms, we will increase our resistance to shocks and some more eliminate the question marks in the minds of investors and put Turkey back into a growth policy of over 5 percent.
Let me be clear, we have such a generous retirement system from here.
I think it would be reasonable to say that our retirement companies are not working hard enough.
Once in the car, the performance will be strong.
What's that?
Because we took precautions.
Companies don’t have to go out and spend money.
Taking these concerns into account, considering the poor performance, we worked out how to allocate global assets to which investment areas.
As you know, the payouts are high.
There will be a performance there, in addition to the 25 percent given by the state.
The rest is in the Treasury Papers, where the risk is usually low.
When we look at the big picture, I think the interest will increase in the coming period.
They will see the performance.
There is no failure in the other field, there is success.
In 2013, we restructured BES.
There are 6.8 million participants, a accumulation of 70 billion liras.
Trust me, the system was successful.
There are also 2.6 million participants in automatic participation, and 775 million liras are accumulated.
We need more effort from the companies.
Let’s do some advertising, let’s talk about this system.
We're working on withdrawal time.
Maybe if we stretch him a little...
We'll see, we're working.
Maybe the citizens will see the return, see the accumulation, and stay in the system.
Output from the system is 38%.
Nearly half of those who leave are those with voluntary individual retirement.
You don't want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing?
You're out of auto participation.
We were expecting a 10 percent drop.
We are also very optimistic there.
Once the system is working.
We brought a prime ceiling.
Insurance companies sometimes explain it unilaterally.
They raised their premiums very quickly.
When we asked them what was going on, they said, “They don’t care about what’s going on.
We have made a new net.
We told you to do your thing.
They said, “We’re not going to judge.
And we said, "That's not going to happen.
We have differences of opinion here.
Of course, when the ceiling passed to the premium application, some companies refused.
We made a new arrangement.
We created a pool of risky insurers.
Let me say this again.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
I mean, I don't find these ceiling price apps right, they forced us.
I would like to see this in three dimensions.
Be aware of the system we are working on.
Two, keep the system running normally, a price on that track.
In addition to its heavy loads, almost 30-31 pounds of every 100 lira premium paid goes to the tax cuts of the SGK.
I'm working right now, and I'm going to talk to our finance minister.
Third, technology is evolving rapidly.
Now, over time, traffic accidents will also be significantly reduced structurally.
This is mandatory traffic insurance.
The next morning, he saved his leg.
Buerger’s disease, which has appeared since puberty, was a condition that used to be common in men, but today it is also common in women.
One of these women is a 36-year-old man.
The pain that began two years ago became chronic in the soles of the feet.
When the young woman who had difficulty walking was at risk of losing her leg, she walked around the hospital.
A friend recommended Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
“Azerbaijan saved the life of the Minister of Emergency Situations,” the headline in SABAH showed.
It turned out that Dursun, who went to Kalko, was struggling with Buerger's disease.
Prof. Dr. Kalko took the young woman to emergency surgery.
After recovering from his pain, Dursun is now receiving oxygen treatment.
Audi to Modify 850,000 Diesel Vehicles While Car Manufacturers Face Reverse Reaction
The day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades on more than 350,000 vehicles.
The head of BMW’s board of directors said BMW, referring to European cities, including central Munich (where diesel vehicles are considered to be banned or restricted), that the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions.”
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes cars in Europe would be modified to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described these moves as recalls.
European automakers have heavily encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help cover carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides released by diesel engines are considered cancer-producing and can cause asthma.
The cost of the equipment that automotive companies need to install to neutralize the dirty smoke produced by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult for cars to keep their price competitive.
While German automakers are facing scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of indulging powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Firms are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, which hides that it uses the device known as a deceptive device and adjusts emissions to comply with the regulations when a car is being tested and loosens it under normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Audi's engine development department, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not protected against extradition and may be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was dragged into a German criminal investigation, including Volkswagen; they expanded the U.S.-based investigation after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to get rid of emissions rules in Europe.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be a burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car maker has an excessive share in Volkswagen’s profits.
Don't jump at every fish you see
Prof. Dr. Yusuf <0xC5><0x9E>ükrü <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar, President of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, warned not to jump fishing in shallow grounds from 2 meters.
Every year thousands of people are at risk of a stroke due to neck fracture and spinal injury due to diving in shallow waters.
Neck fractures most often develop in the 5th or 6th vertebra.
The peculiarity of the fractures is that at this level it affects the nerves that feed the muscles of the arms and legs, as well as the respiratory muscles.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said, "In such accidents, our most valuable organ, the cervical spine, is cut off or compressed by the broken spine."
"The wrong first aid for spinal cord injuries not only increases damage to survivors, but can also lead to death," he said.
Scuba diving ranks fourth in spinal injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20-29 years and the majority are men.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said, “You should not jump into the water that cannot be seen.”
He said, "No matter how well you dive, you can get a serious injury."
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar also recalled:
Depending on the level of the spinal cord where the damage caused by the diving can cause varying degrees of paralysis in the arms and legs.
You may know how to swim, but water can be tricky.
The place that looks deep to you can be shallow.
In the United States and Australia, warning signs placed on the seashore have seen a 70 percent reduction in cases of fishing in shallow water.
Prof. Dr. <0xC3><0x87>a<0xC4><0x9F>lar said, "Although there are 28 provinces in Turkey, there is unfortunately not a single warning sign in places outside Istanbul."
"With respect to this type of life-threatening accidents every summer, under the health department of each province, schools and social awareness project, information light or information boards on the beaches and pools need to be kept in a remarkable way," he said.
Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, Head of Spinal and Peripheral Neurosurgery Group of the TURKISH Neurosurgery Association, suggested that in case of injury:
112 should be called first at the time of the incident.
The neck should be kept as steady as possible, not moved, detected with a hard collar.
The airway should be provided and the patient should be placed on the opposite side for the drainage of the water that escapes to the lungs.
Shouldn't be held by the legs and hanged to drain the water.
No attempt should be made to correct the defect in the patient's neck.
The neck vertebrae may have been broken.
However, if the spinal cord is not damaged yet, an inappropriate position to be given to the neck during first aid and patient transport may cause broken bone fragments to press and cut and damage to the spinal cord.
Provence lavender is threatened by climate change
It had become a symbol of the Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is under threat of climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a huge headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: “Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years, the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which brings rain, much less in the spring and mostly in the fall.
This affects the life of the lavender.
There's also a little cicada, a leaf pest that transmits microbacterial bacteria, and there's a lot of them in very dry air."
And a lot of things are in danger.
As much as it attracts holidaymakers, it follows a lot of lavender oil for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “While we should have very long plant spikes with a few large flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped, or none at all, or weak spikes.
So we have less essential fatty parts."
The revised solutions include better water distribution and slowing soil evaporation, but also spraying a protective mixture of sludge and water on plants and developing species that are more resistant to dry conditions.
Journalist's murder highlights growing threat in Mexico
The weekly newspaper Riodoce’s staff usually meet on Wednesdays to review the latest riots by organised crime in the state of Sinaloa, corrupt officers, and plans for the endless drug wars to be featured in the paper.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they come together to talk about their safety.
They were told it was important to change their routine.
Two senior journalists discuss what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, perceptions and inner voices are enough.
Drug smugglers, politicians, business people, journalists suspected of being paid by governments or cartels, the bad guy who made a list of Mexico's chaos dangerous to write in the paper.
There is no cessation of violence, as the number of bodies nationwide rises, and more are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Peña Nieto took over in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 have been under federal protection after attacks and threats, and at least seven have died in seven states so far this year.
Among the recent deaths are editors and inspirational Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez writes in one of his many books on narcotics violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere, hanging on the facade of Riodoce's building with a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger, with the word "Justice"; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing t-shirts showing his smile, his glasses face, and his Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; reporters talk about their shared traumas, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to handle journalists’ cases, only two were prosecuted, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, journalists' killers are rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, despite their broken hearts, they insist on addressing the violence in Sinaloa, although the ground is now more deceptive.
Without information about the killers, without justice, it works very little to negotiate security, says Ibarra.
"It's silly to waste my time on this workshop," he says.
"Until we know why, you don't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.
The red Toyota Corolla was only able to drive a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; it was forcibly removed from its vehicle and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of its newspaper, which was translated as the Twelve River.
The gunman walked away in his car and hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left his wife and two grown children.
In Culiacan, rumors tend to circulate freely.
But there is almost nothing about Valdez but silence.
After Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the U.S. in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, with rival groups fighting to fill the gap.
In Sinaloa, don’t forget that every day on the street, one or many people are shot and killed, or that the cemetery is filled with more ornate, two-story, living-room mausoleums than most of the drug kings have.
For a minute, forget about the "calm" situation where only one cartel checks its precious ports and routes of drug trafficking to the United States.
Despite this, and despite being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez's work, Riodoce's co-founder and director, Ismail Bojorquez (60), is devastated by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to the murder.
The first was an interview in February with Damaso Lopez, leader of one of the rival cartel groups that was at war with Guzman's sons.
This article may have angered the boys; the possible gang members bought every copy of the raid as soon as it was distributed to the newsstands.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper with the same story was confiscated.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican-origin violence against journalists.
He survived for a very long time, and his friends and co-workers assumed he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste in 2013, when he joined five colleagues selling $50 worth of shares in Riodoce's discovery.
"It was impossible to do journalism without addressing the issue of narcotics in Sinaloa," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper gained fame for its bold and honest news, and sales and ads increased.
Reporters loved to publish life-threatening research without fear of censorship, and readers were caught up in a publication where they could read stories that no one dared to report.
Eight years after its establishment, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for her journalism in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee to Protect Journalists International Press Freedom Award for his courage to pursue the Mexican drug story no matter where it ends up.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to go on living."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said drug trafficking in Sinaloa was "a way of life".
"As a journalist, you have to accept your role. You play this or you play the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, ‘What were you doing in the face of so many deaths... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?’”
The Riodoce staff miss Valdez, the prankster who swears like a porter, his friends who are generous in their hugs and advice, their teachers who know how to survive.
They believed in their routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to a bar across the street called El Guayabo and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask: Is his love for his routine declining?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and survive.
"If you deal with their women, their children, their clean work, the secret airfields they use to transport drugs, they don't like it."
Bojorquez said, "These things were about crossing the line."
The result was a high degree of autocensorship and self-preservation, even at the best time.
Trusting your own instincts.
If it smells bad, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, editor-in-chief of Riodoce, said: “Smell is a sense that can be deceived... and what happened to Javier is what happened to him.”
He and others say that the old rules do not apply in Sinaloa, just as the profitable trafficking routes of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are a toxic mixture do not apply to weak institutions and corrupt government officials.
The ground is constantly changing.
No cell phones are suddenly allowed in the room where Riodoce staff meet for security training; days ago, it turned out that spyware sold only to governments was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Two police officers outside wanted to get rid of the 104-degree (40 Celsius) temperature in the shadow of a tree.
They were allocated by the state government to protect Riodoce's office in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half jokingly, half serious, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were policemen within the 50 percent that the governor himself said were unreliable.
It's been months since reporters went to the mountainous countryside where drug gangs actually control.
In this week’s issue, Riodoce examines three main stories.
The brother of former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez was murdered in Sinaloa.
There was also a disclosure of government spending concentrated on the governor's hometown.
And then there was the kidnapping of a group at Culiacan's most expensive restaurant just a block away from the D.A.
There was no official explanation as to who was kidnapped or how, so when it came time to write down what everyone in the city knew, prudence prevailed: the restaurant was a favorite of both drug smugglers and authorities.
One reporter learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the administration who dominated almost every level of politics throughout the past century.
Recently, many PRI governors have been accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter at the scene to write about the events that had happened before, including the escape of one of Guzman's sons in a military raid.
Only months ago, readers would look at the corner of Valdez for information from the best source on the abduction.
Villareal (46), nicknamed "El Flaco" because of its fine structure, said, "We already knew what had happened before."
"All channels of communication with our sources have been cut off."
As the staff turns into something they never expected, activists on behalf of the press, Valdez's office is being reused as a repository for banners and stickers protesting the murders of journalists.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up a few banners and went on the show the next morning for another journalist in the office of the local prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was found, and according to DNA tests, officials say it's him.
Journalists across the country have expressed their thoughts louder in organized protests by writing "Help the Press" on pavements and buildings.
Today, Bojorquez, the director, is away in Washington, trying to provide international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and forcing them to kill them for telling the truth.
From that day on, he wanted to be appointed to a position other than doing government news, thinking that his anger had undermined his impartiality.
Valdez has consistently said that journalists in Mexico have been "encircled" by organized crime, accomplices, official officials and a reckless society.
In his latest book, "Narco-journalism", he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but by orders of politicians and security forces collaborating with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articolo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to police and officials last year.
"You die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders clearly had the effect of a cold shower.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
His body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and headphones are set next to his ripped head.
In the northern border state of Chihuahua, some broadcasts, such as El Norte, opted to close after reporter Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after their manager was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels with the headline: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their country or even their country.
That's a bad decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still scanning the streets, waiting for danger.
Sometimes, they are captured by photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in an apartment building in Mexico City in 2015 with four women three months after escaping Veracruz.
It's a dance every day with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says that reporting on the drug trade scares her.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
On a recent Saturday at midnight, while preparations were underway for the final issue, Riodoce’s editors were sitting on the curb outside the office drinking beer, while simultaneously ringing their phones.
A series of armed clashes involving rival gangs and security forces near Mazatlan, a beach resort, have resulted in 19 confirmed deaths.
As promised in a series of cartel messages in the vicinity, the war continued to escalate.
They put the news on Riodoce's website through their cell phones on the sidewalk.
The front page would have to be changed the next day.
The sirens are starting to chirp, there's another gunfight in the area.
Bojorquez quickly peered at the guard officers to see if they were on alert.
If they were scared, they wouldn't show it.
Under the gigantic portrait of the succumbing founders of his newspapers, his middle finger was displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, while Riodoce's staff followed in his footsteps.
“How can you think of closing,” Bojorquez said, “when the day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him outside to report to me on the street?”
He used camouflage to avoid dinosaur enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, but it's a terrible one.
The researchers explained that the initial findings of an incredible rhinoceros-sized creature now found by a Canadian miner were very well preserved, as experts described it as the “Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.”
They were so well-preserved that they could tell that the scale skin was reddish brown and that they had a 'problematic history'.
A report in the journal Current Biology described it as “the best preserved armored dinosaur found and one of the best dinosaur breeds in the world.”
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodozor that lived around 110 million to 112 million years ago from the middle of the Cretaceous Period.
His exceptionally well-preserved condition has astounded researchers who have described him as “really wonderful.”
The plant-eating armor is the best-preserved fossil of its kind, according to reports from National Geographic.
He was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in North Alberta Canada, digging the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray.
He hit something that seemed strange to the rock around him and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
They spent the next six years discovering a wild animal in a heap of 2,500 pounds (1100 kg) of soil.
After so much hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
Caleb Brown, the lead scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature was exhibited, said, “If you close your eyes a little, you might even believe it’s almost asleep.”
'It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur species, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.'
By examining its skin, the researchers found that although it was coated with armor and looked like a walking tank, the plant eater was probably facing a serious threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
Quite heavily armored, the dinosaur used its red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and a protective technique known as contra-shadowing, which many modern-day animals also use.
Experts suggest that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing it to better blend into its surroundings and bypass its enemies.
The 110-million-year-old nodozor family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
The researchers have now finished their work, and they named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli, dedicated to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the team who spent more than 7,000 hours laboriously trying to uncover it.
The exceptional preservation of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and his international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the stamps and the armor on the body.
They discovered counter-shadowing, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the upper part of the creature is darker than the lower part.
Although counter-shadowing is common, the findings come as a surprise because the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of counter-shadowed animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaur has been under enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs to hunt, and that evolution has preferred to hide as a method of survival to confront.
But the most contemporary animals (e.g. deer, zebras, or armadillos) that use counter-shadowing are much smaller and are much more open to being prey, which means that this nodozor has faced a serious challenge to survive.
"The powerful hunting applied to a huge, heavy-armoured animal shows how dangerous dinosaur predators in the Cretaceous can be," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate at its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and drifted into the sea, where it sank on its back to the surface of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans were probably far more inland than they are now.
"The nodozor is truly remarkable because it is completely covered and preserved with scaly skin, but also because the original shape of the animal is preserved in a 3D way," Brown said.
The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous.
You don’t need much imagination to rebuild it; if you close your eyes a little, you might even believe it’s almost asleep.”
The Cretaceous was the time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armored dinosaur Borealopelta, which may have been hunted by some of its majestic ancestors.
Among them is the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 ft (11.5m) long, 6 tons-weighted monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings are in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was dragged into the sea after she died and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011, digging the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best-preserved armored dinosaur, including leather and armor, and it's complete from the nose to the hip.
The creature weighs on average around 18 ft (five meters) and up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
He has two 20-inch horns that come out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this armored herbaceous vortex was a cumbersome roaming around what is now Western Canada until it was dragged into the open sea by a overflowing river.
But the dinosaur's underwater tomb preserved its armor in perfect detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular species are so well preserved that the skin fragments still cover layers of bumpy armor along the dinosaur’s skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at her, the more incredible it is.
Fossilized skin fragments are still covering layers of bumpy armor that are dotted in the dinosaur's skull.
His right front leg is lying next to him, with five fingers inclined upward.
I can count the scales on the soles."
Don’t be shy when it comes to teeth.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are every person’s dream.
When people resort to all kinds of ways to whiten their teeth, Nukhet Berk, President of the Association of Oral Laser Applications, warns that products sold in the market or on the Internet should be avoided.
Nükhet Berk stated that such substances sold scratch the enamel surface and that the teeth are colored in such a way that they will not be recycled again. "Bleaching of teeth can be achieved with chemicals applied by dentists or thin porcelain surfaces that stick to the surface of the teeth like nails," he said.
Berk notes that the protection of dental health prevents the occurrence of many diseases and that aesthetic practices are important for mental health by providing both dental and gum health and a beautiful smile:
Teens usually have white teeth unless there is a disorder or genetic factors in their dental structure.
Due to ageing, scratching of tooth enamel, and frequent consumption of cigarettes, abrasive or darker drinks, teeth get darker over the years.
Whitening of teeth can be achieved with chemicals applied by dentists or with thin porcelain surfaces that adhere to the surface of the teeth with minimal or no erosion.
Never whiten teeth with products sold in the market or on the internet.
Because these substances scratch the enamel surface, the teeth are colored so that they can never be recycled again.
Since 2011, Keçiören Municipality provides "Tooth and Oral Health at Home" to elderly, disabled and bedridden citizens.
Köksal Güngör, 65, who has been in bed for 24 years in Keçiören's Awakening Quarter, "My wife knew about this service of Keçiören Municipality."
We called the police and they arrived immediately.
"I'm already paralyzed down the neck, at least I'm not neglecting my dental care because of this service," he said.
Kezban Gökçe, the 72-year-old daughter of 95-year-old Gülizar Ta<0xC5><0x9F>ç<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who lives in P<0xC4><0xB1>narba<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1> Neighborhood, said: "My mother has been dependent on bed for 7.5 years because of old age."
When I arrived at the town hall, I saw posters of this service and immediately called.
We have been receiving this service regularly for 4 years.
I have problems with my teeth, and when the doctors come, they look at me.
“We are very pleased,” he said.
There is no health insurance requirement for the service, which is completely free.
The "small" incident in the Turkish army
Dear readers, at the meeting of the Supreme Military Council (YA<0xC5><0x9E>) held the previous day, very interesting decisions were made, especially in terms of the Navy.
This was brought to the command of the Force, not an oramir, but a coramiral.
It's a practice that's hardly ever been seen in our army.
And how did that happen?
The Commander of the Force, Admiral Bülent Bostano<0xC4><0x9F>lu, has completed his term and will retire...
And it did.
Now the order of command had come to Veysel Kösele, the only oramiral.
Veysel Pasha, who had been a victim of conspiracy in the past and had been imprisoned for a while, was supposed to be the commander of the normal senior ranking.
But the government didn’t want him.
I'm trying to summarize, starting from the top in the Navy, the commanders 1, 3, 4 and 5 have not been promoted.
In this case, there was only one Admiral left in the Navy.
He had to be brought to the vacant post: Admiral Veysel Kösele, Commander of the Navy at number two.
And then what happened?
The sixth-ranked Admiral Adnan <0xC3><0x96>zbal was appointed by the government.
Now look at this picture!
Admiral Veysel Kösele stands there, but he is replaced by a lower-ranking commander!
A senior is being put under the command of a junior.
I wonder what's gonna happen next.
An oramiral who is superior to his rank does not and cannot serve under the command of a lieutenant general who is less than himself.
He doesn't take orders from her, he can't.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this hurtful situation, and if he is not resigned, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the sad message given to him by the government: “Goodbye, Veysel Pasha!”
The news of his resignation was spread yesterday afternoon when I wrote this post, but the situation has not yet been officially announced.
Now let’s look at this again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for one reason or another, refused, forced him to resign, and instead brought a sixth-ranked koramirali to the command and undermined our military's traditional understanding of "Senior."
There is politics in it, and we don’t know behind the scenes.
Maybe if someone tells us soon, we'll all find out!
Dear readers, I have tried to explain very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, the incident of seniority is very important.
Not just as a rank.
For example, the officer who finished 10th is more senior than the one who finished 11th.
The first to be promoted to general is more senior than the second to be promoted.
We've seen concrete examples of this seniority case in the War of Independence.
Commander of the Garp Front Ismet Pasha...
You have two armies at your disposal.
Army and 2nd Army.
We're in 1922, and our armies will launch a major offensive and expel the Greek army.
At this stage, there are valuable names that are expected to be assigned to the army command.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He is offered the command of the army, but he says, "The name is younger than me, I can't go to his command."
Another name is Jacob Shevki (Subaba<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>) Pasha.
Atatürk's lecturer at the War Academy...
A valuable and senior commander, whom he loves, whom he cherishes, whom he calls "Teacher", who has taken part in various wars.
In 1919, soldiers and civilians were captured along with Turkish intellectuals and deported to the island of Malta by the British.
On his return home, he is reluctant to command the army and says the same thing: "The commander of the Western Front is underage, I cannot take orders from him."
However, Atatürk convinces him of the request, and Yakup Shevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third one is a very colorful name.
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) Pasha.
A soldier who talks too much, constantly criticizes.
A commander who fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is also exiled by the British to Malta, where he escapes and arrives in Ankara via Kusadasi.
When he was offered the command of the army, Ali <0xC4><0xB0>hsan Pasha said the same thing: "I cannot fight under the command of <0xC4><0xB0>smet, who is less than me."
But he is convinced...
But look, after taking office, he is constantly arguing with Ismet Pasha, commander of the Garp Front, to whom he came under his command, making a scene and disturbing the army...
And shortly before the big attack, he is removed from office and retired, replaced by the bearded Nurettin Pasha.
After that, Ali <0xC4><0xB0>hsan Pasha's relationship with Atatürk never improves.
The senior issue in the Turkish army stands out not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course he has to go out.
Veysel Kösele is the last example of this.
An activist had to find out the answer to the question, "Whose Streets Are They?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shaken.
The day after he arrived in New York City for a tour, the native of St. Louis sat on the bed of his rented Airbnb and began to browse Facebook on his phone.
It happened to be shared by someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy and he's still lying on the street."
Surprised to find that no one else shared this information in the content stream, he turned off Facebook and started Twitter.
A user named <0x40>TheePharoah was constantly retweeted in his content stream.
The rapper from St. Louis was tweeting live about the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old unarmed black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He shared a photo of Brown's dead body lying on the street, where he would stay for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, "That's savage."
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He left his phone to return to tweets about gathering people on Canfield Drive later that same evening.
There were police tapes, yelling people, and photographs of a man holding a banner that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!" claiming to be Brown's father.
A live broadcast was watched by a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, he said, set the trigger on his rifle and shouted: "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
Ferrell recalled, "It's not unusual."
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and typical of."
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return ticket and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 a.m., he took his six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go with her to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years will come to theaters on August 11th, the subject of a new documentary called "Who's Streets?"
This is a story about survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance, and the people who live in that society and fill the streets with the answers they are looking for.
As Ferrell drove his car to Ferguson with his daughter, who wore a flower dress and wore a crown that suited him, they returned to the conversation about the experiences of blacks and the situation of blacks, which they had done so many times before that morning.
"Remember when I taught you that black people should fight for what they believe?"
“We’re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that’s not true.
“I couldn’t take it,” Ferrell said later.
"What happened here today... is a consequence of what happened in the past.
He must know, see, and grow in it.
Not only should it develop well in the field of activism and organization, but it should also know the layers of the black experience and its black status and know what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
Even if I were lucky enough to give her an experience of rough racism that she wouldn't personally experience, she wouldn't be any different from any black woman-child.
I feel like I’m going to do him harm by protecting him from them.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was on South Florissant Road, which turned into a campground for activists, where they waited to talk about the matter across the police station, which resulted in the subsequent indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and his daughter contacted local business owners who were preparing packaged food.
They prepared bags and helped deliver them to the protesters.
A new kind of activism was slowly taking shape for Ferrell.
As a student at Missouri State University, he was the president of the Union of Nurses for Minority Students, and his focus was on food justice and health injustice in the black community. "My activism has completely transformed after August 9," he said.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It came spontaneously."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, on an evening screening.
Folayayan said he and his own film director Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what was going on.
Ferrell asked, “Do you want to document, or do you want to find a story that you can use?”
This skepticism was reported by countless people, usually whites, to come to a society and benefit from its pain and resistance.
As Folyan explained in a recent interview: “We heard that people born and raised in Ferguson couldn’t concentrate their voices, so we decided to do it differently.”
Folayan had already contacted regional artist co-director Damon Davis, who is known for his activism regarding the death penalty prisoners.
His involvement warmed Ferrell to the project, which was followed by six other locals, as well as the "Who's Streets?" team in the years following Brown's shooting.
David said, “This is not a documentary about someone talking to us or talking to us; it’s us talking.”
“That’s what really matters to me, how these people will be represented, because that’s how I will be represented.”
"While the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, it shows that the movement "is not about a messiah leader, it's about community gathering," he said, "it proved to be the most obvious of the film participants."
As a result, "Who's Streets?" is surprisingly documenting the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
Laughing at his first sight of the finished product, Ferrell said, "I felt naked."
"But when I was doing this and humanizing black people, I knew there could be some sensitivity."
Ferrell’s story also reinforces the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement and puts them back in the spotlight.
Two of the three co-founders of the movement, who derived the <0x23>BlackLivesMatter slogan after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, describe themselves as gay.
"Black gay women in leadership have generally maintained the movement," Ferrell said, "and that's because we're constantly at war on many fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all the weight of this.”
Folayan added: “The movement is really being held up by black women and many gay black women.”
Ferrell, however, insists that "there is nothing in the form of affirmative action" and that he was not elected because of his identities.
He says, "He was the one who activated this energy."
“But it’s no coincidence that she’s at the forefront, because as a black gay woman, there’s a lot you have to lose by living a life in these intersections.
You can feel his energy on the screen.”
Meanwhile, news cameras are long gone in Ferguson, but alarming racial ties between society and the police continue.
Ferrell is under further surveillance for another 2.5 years due to blocking the highway during a demonstration.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in what he calls home as a "complexity."
Still, Ferguson has a song he engraved in his memory exactly three years ago that he took to the streets.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Winning is our duty.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round!
Irving told NBC Sports: “The world is not round.”
The world is flat.
They get people to get used to these things by giving them fear.
Oh, man, don't question me too much.
Because the more information you solve, the more information you get.
This is insane.
Is the world flat?
Or does it revolve around itself?
I think you should investigate this.
I'm telling you, they're lying to our faces.
They lied to us! he said.
Irving said, “For years I believed in what I wanted to believe.”
I thought the world was round.
Do you really think we're going back into the solar system?
Nothing they send comes back.
He's not coming back!
The information they give us is very inconsistent.
The truth is here.
You just have to look for this truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims the earth is flat, is battling the Cleveland Cavaliers with an average of 24.4 points and 5.9 assists this season.
A Convenient Similarity: The Artist Uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to Create Portraits
In the middle of the room at the New York Fridman Gallery, there are many faces, white, black and brown, each almost vaguely similar to each other, hanging over the cables on the ceiling.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from earsticks and cut hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Former intelligence analyst Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison after leaking secret diplomatic messages via WikiLeaks, sent his cut hair from Fort Leavenworth prison.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Convenient Similarity.
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans-woman pardoned by Barack Obama and a prominent dissident, three days before his sentencing.
By analyzing the DNA extracted from Manning algorithmically and using what a person with this gene data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg created 30 portraits, revealing not only the processingability of DNA data (there are many ways to interpret it and the determinism that comes from the essence of interpretations), but also his identity with a firm, perhaps somewhat cerebral interpretation.
Born Bradley Edward, but openly identifying himself as a woman in adolescence, Manning was convicted in 2013 for 20 crimes, six of which were under the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
His image was pressured by the prison, so much that he had only one photo: a sandy, black-and-white selfie of Manning, visibly agitated, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a self-contained platinum-yellow wig.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was successful with the gigantic success of his 2012 project, More Weird Premonitions.
In this, the artist produced portraits by filtering DNA from the debris of forensic pieces such as cigarette butts and gum to produce a picture of what these people might look like.
At that moment, he received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were interviewing Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some kind of portrait that could accompany this writing," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition.
They couldn't be visited, and they couldn't be photographed, so they went to Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his incarcerated inspiration became unexpected correspondents, with many letters exchanged over the course of two years.
They even uncovered the Repressive Images, a cartoon book illustrated by Shoili Lawngo, in which the president pardoned Chelsea's punishment and imagined a future where she could personally view the exhibition.
The fact that Obama actually asked Manning to be released a few days after the book was actually a happy coincidence that went well after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump finds new, tweetable ways to wage war on government-related leakers and transgender soldiers and further fuel the sharp divides he is asked to repair, there is something deep and powerful about this exhibition that is currently opening.
When asked about the strange timing of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Events happen for a reason."
An artist's statement, written on the wall of the gallery, under which Manning's signature in huge dimensions (the "i" in his last name is placed with the heart), called for an end to "automatic discrimination" based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
Across the wall is his mitochondrial DNA sequence: many C's, G's, and A's written in pencil.
By incorporating 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to describe how surprisingly similar we are all, at least as biological creations.
"What I hope people get out of this is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how subjective genetic data is," Dewey-Hagborg said in a 2007 video of his work, "Imitate Memories."
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and this is 30 of them."
The last piece of the exhibition, held in a single room, is a page from a short comic book mentioned earlier.
Here's Manning, the King Kong style, showing off with a hand-held speaker from the United States Disciplinary barracks.
It says, "When they silence your speech, they win."
"So don't ever shut up."
The artist from Philadelphia said, "This came directly from a letter he wrote to me."
"When I still talk about it, it makes my hair tick."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition (as he imagined highly visionary from the cartoon book), but when he does, he will be greeted by masks with their own genetic imitations, gathering like a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything else in the exhibition, the genetic haplogroups ranged from the size of Manning (5"2, Manning's height) to the height of his pencil, which was specifically done.
Dewey-Hagborg said, “In the past, I used to put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd.”
“I wanted it to be perceived as a collective movement shaped by Chelsea, which is the movement behind his emancipation.”
Northwestern training officer and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
Police say a nationwide manhunt has been launched for a Northwestern University trainee and a University of Oxford employee suspected of being found stabbed to death in a luxury apartment building in Chicago.
Cook's administration district records show arrest warrants for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for first-degree murder without bail for allegedly taking part in the murder of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau on Monday.
Documents say Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being stabbed multiple times.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said a body was found on July 27.
Officers received a phone call, reached Grand Plaza Apartments, and found the victim with many deep cuts on his body.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau had been reported dead at the scene, and while police were actively searching for the two suspects, detectives were investigating the stabbing as a homicide.
Lathem has been an associate professor at Northwestern University in microbiology and immunology since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an email that Lathem was on administrative leave and was banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"This is a criminal case under investigation by the necessary authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior financial assistant at the University of Oxford.
"We are in contact with the UK police and are ready to assist U.S. investigative authorities in any way they need," a spokesperson from the University and the University of Somerville said in an email.
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi of the Chicago Police Department said he strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but our efforts to identify them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the building manager of Grand Plaza, who had just received a mysterious clue that something was happening in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as terrifying.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He said security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren were in the building.
Guglielmi said: “We believe that the teacher Latham and the victim had an affair.
The management staff at Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents saying: "The police are still working on the victim's timeline and history and are investigating a number of motives for a possible domestic incident."
Italy seizes German ship
Italian police said the vessel Iuventa, which was carrying out search and rescue operations in the Central Mediterranean, had been seized on Lampedusa Island yesterday.
The police, who shared the records of the phone conversations that they claimed belonged to two members of the organization with journalists, announced that this operation was carried out within the scope of the investigation initiated by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
The members of the Jugend Rettet, who are alleged to have "acted in favor of illegal immigration on the Libyan-Italian line," have brought asylum seekers to Italy at least three times, which they have taken directly from the boats of Libyan human traffickers.
Members of the Jugend Rettet, who were questioned by the prosecution, allegedly committed the crime with some members of the Libyan Coast Guard.
They said that they would continue to save the lives of the people, and that they were assessing the charges against them.
In addition to the ships under the Italian Coast Guard and the European Union (EU) mission, about nine international non-governmental organizations are also involved in the search and rescue of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government has issued a 13-point code of conduct for these organizations to comply with, and stipulated that it should be signed.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: “We will complete the WADA roadmap in the short term”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the rest of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to resume operation.
“A certain stage in the fulfillment of the roadmap criteria has been completed, RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this context," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulation Compliance Roadmap, which recently published on the institution's website, describing the criteria that regulate the resumption of RUSADA.
According to Mutko, this does not include anything to worry Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future.”
However, one criterion on the list is that Russian anti-doping authorities are obliged to publicly acknowledge the reported results of the alleged state-sponsored doping investigation in Russian sports conducted by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, approved by the WADA.
Mutko said: “While our anti-doping system recognizes a failure, we are conducting the investigation.
All precautions have been taken.
But there is no state program, and we will not accept anything that does not exist.”
Mutko's words reiterated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, president of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Speaking to Russian broadcaster RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov acknowledged his past problems with Russia’s anti-doping bodies, but added: “We have told him on many occasions that the report includes positions and regulations that create contradictions.
No one is considering accepting the report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
In November 2005, the WADA suspended Russia from conducting doping controls in Russia following the doping scandal.
However, under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD), this June test planning and coordination was allowed.
In July, after a visit to the agency's headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli announced that RUSADA was "going in the right direction" to resume operations.

The President of Galatasaray will not return empty-handed
The former president of Galatasaray, Faruk Süren, criticized Dursun <0xC3><0x96>zbek, who went to Bucharest to persuade Mircea Lucescu and to the capital Ankara for the transfer of Ndiaye.
Here’s a quote from the president for his morning readers:
He said, “We’re going to finish when we’re done.”
The President of Galatasaray will not go away in vain, nor will he return empty-handed.
Ndiaye transfer: Galatasaray president does not go to football.
Football is on the President’s feet.
Of course, they will meet, kiss your hand, or hug you.
But whoever the player is, the president doesn't go to his feet.
You give 9 million euros to the player that Ottomanspor bought for 300,000 euros...
It's not 7.5 million, it's 9 million with bonuses!
You've already invested a lot, of course you're going to play it and it's going to be 7.5...
Uzbek’s actions: I don’t want to criticize.
But it's clear.
G. Saray's values are eroding.
It’s not just football, it’s all wrong.
It is the Board and the General Assembly that will change this.
As far as I can tell, the members are happy!
Start-ups that will help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee happiness at the e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
The answers were usually vague, unhelpful, or worse, deceptive.
Even if he committed anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
"There has never been consistency or objectivity," says Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company in San Francisco on hair care.
He also called for help from outside.
A new kind of human resource start-up is emerging to enable companies to understand how their employees feel.
They produce and license a software whose specific purpose is to measure employee engagement, enabling companies to conduct rapid-choice surveys, targeting specific teams and demographic groups, providing employees with anonymity and complaints helplines, and in some cases bypassing top executives and going directly to the board to allow employees to announce an irresponsibility.
Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City start-up Glint, who measured employee engagement by companies, said: “There are now tools like Strava and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is your company’s Fitbit?”
Using Glint, Errett says he understands better what his employees think and feel after three years.
In addition to offering quick surveys and optional surveys to specific teams, it also offers a heat map showing which departments of the company received the most complaints and which managers had low ratings, so the reasons can be tampered with.
To avoid becoming the next Uber, companies are beginning to understand that they need to know about the culture of their workplaces; Uber has been in a scandal since a blog post by a former employee described an environment of harassment in which those who openly say what they think are being punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this request for oversight is a very profitable business opportunity.
According to the financial technology insights website Let’s Talk Payments, the global management, regulation, and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and efficacy in Denver Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies detect and prevent bad behavior, has risen among Uber’s discrediting debates earlier this year.
Convercent has close to 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to perform personalized “pulse” surveys, collect real-time stealth responses, and extract heat maps of problematic areas.
It also offers an anonymous helpline where employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is charged, the complaints go directly to the board of directors.
Covercent's founder and president, Patrick Quinlan, said, "The public court has taken over the regulators."
Quinlan said: “If a company doesn’t treat its employees poorly or ethically, even if regulators don’t intervene, consumer boycotts, employee losses, or lawsuits can have costly consequences.
With more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, the restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for over a year to ensure that its employees are aware of the principles and procedures and provide a way to easily reach the company’s headquarters.
When a former employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email from the company headquarters, making a formal complaint and hoping it would be taken seriously.
Ruby Tuesday’s chief legal adviser, James Vitrano, said these are mostly intimidating and disturbing experiences, not a good way to track employee complaints.
But now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers who lived in office, city, or state distances (such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair salaries) can be identified and resolved more quickly.
Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group, said: “I can approach this employment experience from a holistic 360-degree perspective.”
"We also protect our shareholders against business litigation."
After accounting firm Arthur Andersen sank in 2002 due to violations of ethical values arising from the Enron scandal, companies took issues of ethics, values, and relationship with the employee more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after "social media came to a standstill", firms realized they couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from becoming viral.
“Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge repeated fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who support both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising its total capital to $47 million.
Glint provided $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and raised his total funding to $60 million.
Considering the nature, culture and risk capital of companies that are connected to each other, these investments are no surprise.
Increasing amounts of research show that today’s employees expect more from their workplaces than they did before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and given their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint, said: “When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices are heard and what they do is satisfying, they are more sincere in making that company successful.”
Investors earn profits when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well if their employees are sincere and feel they belong to the company.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase the sincerity and sense of belonging of employees, it’s no surprise they’ll find support.
Having data on employee engagement is important to workplace culture experts.
But the data is useless if the company's responsible people don't take action.
In fact, if a company wants feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn’t come quickly enough or never, it can lead to disappointment and make employees feel like they’re disconnected.
Russell Raath, head of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, said: “If you want 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to speak 4,000 words.”
"Because if you don't follow me, the employees will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why should I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem was reported in Glint.
And after collecting feedback from employees who were tired of the decision-making mechanism and the speed of communication quality, he was able to reorganize various teams within the company and added communication training to solve problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is gaining new insights about its employees and hopes that in the long run, it will be able to hire more workers in this type of industry, which is known to have a high number of employee inputs and outputs.
Vitrona said, “If you’re not committed to building a culture of transparency, you lose people.”
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you lose companies.”
It's a long day for the Bruins to get the NCAA off two training sessions a day.
It’s 11:00 a.m. and a bunch of UCLA football players hang out on the edge of a new training ground on campus to chat.
Some strip off their jerseys, revealing their sweat-sliding backs from the trouble of the first day at the training camp.
For a significant part of the team, these free minutes form the mid-day break.
After 3 hours of training, players enrolled in summer classes will return to their homeland and study for their final exams before returning to Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6.30 the next morning.
The Bruins coach Jim Mora said Monday, just before returning to Tuesday: "The next three days are a torment for these men."
Organized to lift the burden on players, the NCAA’s lifting of two training sessions a day, at least until the finals ended on Friday, actually extended their days.
That’s why UCLA’s first three training sessions are scheduled to begin at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate players’ already tight schedule.
The lack of two training sessions a day is more like a one-day training; the Bruins advance the start of the camp nearly a week ahead of last season, and during the summer school, Mora is training at the summer school for the first time during his six seasons in Westwood.
They plan to hold 18 training sessions by August 20, before starting official match preparations for their opening in September against Texas A<0x26>M.
Mora said the NCAA supports the rule change, although players have added new pencils to their busy schedule.
Mora said, “We put a huge burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very difficult.”
"And they've been through this recently; they're working, they're great kids.
I think we’ll have more time when we get to Saturday, it’s going to be really great.”
UCLA will stop training when the camp is over; the next parking lot and the next-door luxury hotel Luskin Center, which is flooded with soccer balls and closes the back of the castle with a protective net, is not an easy task considering their field lies on the line of sight.
Players from the Bruins are scheduled to move into the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora admits that there may be a problem with the emptying of these rooms during the season.
Mora said, "We'll have security."
“It’s a real concern, and it’s not so crazy to think someone’s going to rent a room and sit there and film a training session.
If you have a video recording of a workout, that's a pretty good thing.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security upstairs at parking lot 8.
We will do our best with what we have.
I won't worry too much about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook boosts story verification power to fight fake news
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story validators and show their findings under its original share, as the world’s largest online social network on Thursday described how it was trying to fight what they called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that they would use updated machine learning to detect possible scams and send them to story validators, potentially showing the story verification results at the bottom of the original article.
Facebook has been criticized for being one of the main distribution points of news known as fake news, which many believe has affected the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, as French voters have been hit by fake news before the May presidential election and Germany’s support of the penalty cut plan if they fail to quickly remove hateful posts on social media networks there before the September election.
In a separate statement in German on Thursday, Facebook said a test of the new story verification feature is being launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Facebook news feed product manager Sara Su said in a blog: “In addition to seeing what stories are being discussed by third-party story validators, people want more resources on what they read and share to make informed decisions.”
He added that Facebook will continue to test its "relevant article" feature and work on other changes in the news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating Comics: The Story of a Castle in England
In its recent history, the tiny Scottney Castle was featured in a Squeeze music clip and was a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But right now, inspired by a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire, a broom-haired, passionate historian, Scotland has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent.
“I find it very nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says sadly.
"What a personal connection it is to hold this letter in my hand."
A Castle in England from the Edwardian era to the Middle Ages, each story documents families who lived in Scotland to be portrayed by a different artist from the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: he also wrote The Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories in 2014, a project he found unexpectedly emotional, inspired by stories from the British Library.
"I'm even tearing my eyes to the fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a dual agent working for King James fans," he says.
"That was his thumb!
The letters always smell like work because you used to light a fire for light.
For someone 300 years in the future, this smell feels like he's there too.
I love the archives!”
As a lover of old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and being in a castle for almost four months ("Honestly, I've been a little over-the-top with my warm welcome.") seems too good.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" Victorian fortress, scanning the archives and studying many treasures and antiques, such as hyenas heads mounted on the walls of the mansion and bottles spent centuries in the ditches.
He wandered through the lands and ruins of the old castle, talking to Rangers, gardeners, and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank whiskey and started writing.
As the National Trust has access to full access only when its last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006, Scotney's detailed history is relatively unknown.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only begun to handle the archives, which he described as follows: "The aristocracy of hundreds of years was saying, 'Oh, throw it in the attic.'
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that set the boundaries of who owns what: "You think land disputes will be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch tree on which two families fought.
Forget it, people!"
Some of the stories in the collection, including The Laborer, who left the newly built castle to join the Peasant Rebellion in 1381, use the castle as a bounce point for a wider introduction to British history.
"In this book, The Knights of the City and Sussex, there is a record of a rebellion in the castle in 1380," Rhodes says.
“The Peasant Rebellion started around here, and I thought that an uprising might be a good starting point.
“Maybe these two are related?”
Other stories are closely related to the castle’s history, such as The Priest, who tells the story of the Darrell family, who hid a Jesuit priest for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, where 18th-century smuggler Arthut Darrell, who is thought to have filled a coffin with stones and plotted his own funeral (a revelation made years later when his coffin was removed from the ground).
The Darrells were Rhodes’ favorite Scotney family: “These gentlemen seemed to be pretty scams, they were always in debt, and they were spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
In different generations, the Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women; I imagine them as a group of handsome men who had the ability to flirt with female heirs.”
Rhodes, whose mission at the castle ended, is in search of another singular writing experience.
In Finnish wildlife, he completed a two-week work for a comic book about Elämämämäki, the site of a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, which has since been recaptured by nature.
But Scotney holds a special place in his heart.
She says, "I was sorry I left."
"It's like, 'Oh, now I have to go and face his goddamn real life.'
'Maho' reaction to Meral <0xC5><0x9E>ener
Ismet Büyükataman, Secretary General of the Nationalist Movement Party, made a written statement about the resignation claims made in social media and the media about MHP in recent days.
Using social media and the expression that "some old rifle Marxists have flown from the corners" to the MHP, Büyükataman suggested that "the country has resorted to games and stalls to prevent the movement from continuing its existence under the MHP roof after 12 September".
Grandfather said these things:
"No matter how corrupt the history of the Turkish nation, who cannot digest the historical existence of the Turkish nation, who cannot trace the homeland of the Turk, the criminal file is blurred, the idea is blurred, the mind is confused, he rubs his hands."
"Now they have come out "MHP Kocaeli Gölcük District Organization and 410 members and 215 people have resigned in Yeni<0xC5><0x9F>ehir district of MHP Bursa".
The public is misled by unfounded news such as 250 resignations and 300 resignations.
The lies in the columns of the newspaper have deepened, the deception has deepened.
As there is no resignation in this number, the number of destitutes in the mentioned places does not exceed the fingers of one hand.
He said that the public is being misled and the perception management is being carried out with the polls that he calls "so-called" about the resignations.
"The propaganda and campaigns of these people to create perceptions against the MHP will be reversed," he said.
MHP Secretary General Büyükataman, who stated that MHP is an important and indispensable actor of Turkish politics, said about the resignations:
The remnants of the swords of the old Marxists cannot destroy the place the MHP has acquired in the conscience of the Turkish nation.
There is a dirty account behind all the interpretations and methods of perception management applied.
Because politics and the media have kept an eye on the MHP base.
Those of us who don’t have the time and energy to do anything good for our community are not going to be able to do it right now.
What about those of us who can’t afford to resign?
In their lives, they have not done good to MHP, they have not shared our memories, they have not understood our ideals, they have not participated in our struggle, even if they do, the people who have always stood on the sidelines, whose minds have been charred and whose hearts have been stoned should find other occupations for themselves.
The efforts of those who are unable to draw on the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party, the efforts of sectarianism, the search for debate and factionization are in vain.
And he will turn back and shoot his owner.
The Nationalist Movement is the last stronghold of the Turkish nation that has remained standing despite heavy destruction.
In his statement, Büyükataman, who calls "political forgers" and "political smugglers" for those he claims to be targeting MHP, said, "The nationalist movement is not without owners."
"External ties inside, fed from beyond the ocean, will not reach their goals at any cost," he said.
In his statement, MHP's Büyükataman, who used the phrase, "Traitors with leashes will go mad and be burned in a feud", put together opposition parties and terrorist organizations and made the following claims: "From CHP to HDP, from Perincekgills, from PKK to FET<0xC3><0x96>, whatever they do, they are the ones who will not own the fate of the Turkish people."
Yesterday we resisted the new tactics and games of those who planned Turkey without MHP, without MHP; we fought to the end with the bastards who wanted the government without MHP, without MHP, without Parliament.
Now we're going to ruin the games, ruin the players.
"The patent of the country is in MHP," said Büyükataman, implying Meral Ak<0xC5><0x9F>ener. "As in Banker Bilo, an old Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilcam film, Maho said that he would take the villagers to Germany for days after he drove them to the truck safe and said that he would take them to the hillside of Istanbul."
It's their business, but all we want from them is for them to be new to where they're going.
Kjaer signed for Sevilla
Kjaer, who was transferred from the yellow-blue team to Sevilla for a price of 12.5 million euros, has signed the official contract, which has become the most expensive defender transfer of the Spanish team.
The Danish star will wear the number four jersey in Seville.
It is easy for your family to have babies.
The national airline, which puts the flight comfort and satisfaction of its passengers at the forefront and works to make them feel more comfortable throughout the flight, continues to develop new ideas for an excellent travel experience, according to a statement from THY Press Advisory.
In this direction, the "baby travel kit", which is prepared by examining the needs of babies and their families aged 0-2, has started to be offered to passengers travelling on intercontinental flights since August.
The kit, which is made with a specially designed bag, includes a lower change cover, disposable food apron, cat cream, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton wipe and chest pad.
Products that do not contain parabens, alcohol, paint and harmful chemicals were produced taking into account the sensitivity of the baby’s skin.
Washington is changing its Green Card rules.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has said there will be a new U.S. immigration plan that changes the Green Card rules.
It envisions a reduction of legal migrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work permits and restrictions for family visas.
The new rules were proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in both chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise salaries and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. grants green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing regime.
This new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, self-sufficient financial resources, and those who have the skills to benefit our economy," Trump said.
Writers commented on Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz match
For two seasons I could not find the enthusiasm and glory that I could not see again.
A team of "mangal heart", which Aykut Ka<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>man put out in poverty, was on the field to make a "stand behind us" agreement with his supporters.
“We can bring criticism to his game, positions or performances, but I haven’t seen a game that works and looks like this in a long time.
He made it clear in the first match, but yesterday he put his shoulder straps on himself; Fenerbahçe’s field commander is now Valbuena.
His age was a problem when he was transferred, but in his words there was the phrase "never giving up character".
Thirty years ago, we gave Riza <0xC3><0x87><0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>mbay the right to name the atomic ant.
If he wins, he will be the best player for the French team.
He was all over the field, participating in all pass organizations, always taking responsibility and scoring a goal, making it a giant show in the short run.
Alper's lead, his second striker position, left Sturm Graz "restricted" on the field for a long time.
While Fenerbahçe closed the circuit without a corner, he was constantly looking for a formula to overcome such a hard wall.
They dominate the ball, but they can't produce an effective pass in a competitive penalty area.
This image may come with the comment "the centrist needs", but we are facing a game that is hesitant to pass on Ahmethan, the only centrist in his possession who can't get into the position.
Either the team doesn’t trust the young player, or his performance needs to improve a little bit.
After the score was 1-1, they failed to take advantage of two net opportunities.
It was important for them to pass the round, but standing up for this supporter who applauded the players' struggle would make the night even more beautiful.
There will probably be one or two more transfers by Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahçe's biggest need is number 12...
We are on the brink of a very bright and enjoyable season with this style of play that carries the hearts of those in the tribune who are trying to play in front.
Aykut Gigaman is installing his machine strap, he needs a little more time.
They're in good physical condition.
The quality of the game will improve.
You can also see that the confidence of all the footballers in the field has increased.
They need a lot of applause from last night for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just when you think 2017 can't get any weirder, there's a new report on technological developments in the sex robot industry.
Oh, yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Agency for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report looking at the development of sex robots over the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot’s eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
Mr Sharkey said of the new report: “People are laughing at them, but companies are actually sending a lot, and we’re going to see more of them.”
Modern sex dolls evolved from their inflatable counterparts to robots with silicon skin that were hot to touch, especially human-like reactions performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also choose anything from the robot’s eye color, nipple shape and nail type or color to personalize their robots to fit their own beliefs.
But with so many robots having “personalities” to make a Stepford Woman look innovative, this becomes even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into silicone-skinned robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to personalize their robots based on the character traits they find attractive (e.g. shyness).
Then there are sex robots developed by True Companion that come with pre-programmed personalities that give the impression of shyness, including "Frigit Farrah" and "Wild Wendy" with their "adventurer" personality.
True Companion’s website is ecstatic: “Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as much as possible.”
So whatever you love, whatever you don’t like, you don’t like.
They also have moods during the day, just like real people.
He can be sleepy, willing to talk, or he can be in "full mode."
There are many disturbing aspects to the rise of sex robots: not only the replacement of real human relationships, but also the highly submissive female personality traits, the rape connotations when approaching Frijit Farah, are the most thought-provoking.
On its website, True Companion compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t men have a Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots aren’t just fetishes or sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity signal something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex through subjugation, an optional add-on.
Many men will not naturally have sex robots, and although the FRR draws attention to their growing popularity, they are currently on the outskirts of consumer culture.
But those who leak from the edges can be highly instructive about the course of the period we are living in.
Many people are not weird or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be.
With a president in the White House who boasts of sexually assaulting women, it's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots emerged at a time when women's rights were under threat around the world.
The creepiest thing about The Handmaid’s Tale TV series is that it’s not the depictions that show all the details, the dead bodies or the carved eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change, but it doesn’t feel like such a big change right now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create as many physical similarities as possible to real women (in proportions of porn stars, of course).
Their creators want them to feel human when they are touched and to imitate the movements of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personality," robots are clearly unable to represent real women.
They cannot leave their wives or leave them.
They have no activity or past stories, nothing that would expose their independence or disrupt the fantasy of total slavery.
In other words, they are pleasure slaves.
Or as 2017 would be called: concubines.
U.S. military convoy attack: dead and wounded
The suicide attack in Karabakh district of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, targeted foreign military forces operating in the country.
The explosion, which killed 1 NATO soldier and 3 civilians, included the wounded, five of them were American soldiers in the convoy and one of them was an interpreter working with NATO forces.
In a statement issued by NATO support forces in Afghanistan, it was noted that NATO forces exploded a suicide bomber’s home-made explosives during a joint patrol with the Afghan National Army.
The injured personnel have been treated at the American Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
The lives of the wounded are not in danger.
Local media reported that the suicide bomber belonged to the Taliban.
Trump's great talent?
Making Mitt Romney look like an example of common sense
The fact that the political divide that polarized U.S. voters divides families on a microscale has become the reality of the Trump era.
Newspapers in the US around Christmas and Thanksgiving were filled with how to deal with the nightmare of relatives voting for Trump.
We're all trying to blow up our so-called filtering bubbles.
The less talked about is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I'm referring to this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and is in a broken relationship with the Republicans in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
It reminds me that unification against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Everyone he knows, including his Republican brother, whom Trump has debated for decades about politics with his presence in the White House, is suddenly and oddly on the same side.
At the dinner table, of course, this is a good thing, but it seems to me that in a broad context, it carries significant risks.
The left was portrayed by Trump, but the bending effect of his presidency created a push to the right for all of us.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the terrible possibility that one day his bizarre behavior may no longer shock him.
There is even a more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who are breaking his own standards, and all of a sudden they seem to be symbols of logic.
I find myself feeling nostalgic about the bizarre version of Mitt Romney’s madness these days: the dog on the roof of the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like), both of which are really very mild in comparison to Trump.
When Trump is gone, the next Republican candidate needs only to be sane in order to be evaluated for immeasurable progress.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, which is the biggest carousel run by the New York Parks department, and the best three bucks you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are huge, fiberglass designs in the central cylinder (all clowns and animals making strange faces turned to look scared from behind their own shoulders) and clinking music is ecstatic.
In other words, many clichés of a city can be disappointing: the views of tall buildings are becoming boring, the horizon line becomes too familiar to create too much excitement, and the reality of the city does not reach the dreamer.
It’s been thirty-five years, and I still couldn’t quite get over the day I discovered that the Swiss Cottage was actually a large crossroads in northern London (the theme bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count) rather than a Swiss country house.
But the carousel in Central Park is still a strangely magical experience, so two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go here and all have a great time.
If I could grade the carousel, I'd give it a full grade, but thankfully no one asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to evaluate my transaction "experience" from 1 to 5 stars before passing my credit card at a bookmark this week.
The same thing at the coffee shop on the corner of my street, and the option to match the grade with a 15% tip, for what was bought at the counter.
The effect of this is not only that it slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also that it puts pressure on the server to personalize an event that is not needed at all.
While the poor woman at the marshal stood and smiled as she apologized, I, who was bored, gave her five stars in my credit card experience.
When the temperature exceeded 41 degrees, they wore swimsuits.
In Tunceli, where one of the hottest days of the season was experienced, people flocked to the beaches of Munzur.
At noon, the young, the old, the old, the women and the men, who entered the beaches on the banks of the Munzur River with the intense heat from the afternoon, tried to protect themselves from the heat by cooling in the ice-cold waters.
Especially in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and the United Kingdom, the beaches on the shores of the Munzur River were filled due to Tunceli citizens spending their holidays in their homeland instead of Aegean or Mediterranean.
Suna Tosun, who is among the coolers in Munzur Beach, stated that she prefers Tunceli instead of western provinces for the holiday, "I did not want to spend my holiday in the west, it was better to cool down in Munzur as a family and stay in our own lands."
"Munzur's ice water is nowhere in the world, at these temperatures, Munzur cools us," he said.
Hasan Ulu, who came from Germany, said that they preferred the shore of Munzur <0xC3><0x87>ay<0xC4><0xB1> in Tunceli rather than the shores of Cesme or Bodrum and that they did not regret it.
Oscar Pistorius taken from prison to hospital with chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he said occurred after he fell in his prison cell.
Pistorius was convicted of homicide after objections by prosecutors to the previous verdict of accidental manslaughter.
In the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, Steenkamp was shot several times in front of a bathroom door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder who was hiding in his cabin at night.
Prosecutors said they intend to appeal again against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they consider too light this time.
The National Prosecutor’s Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be considered this year.
Pistorius will face a 15-year sentence if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The first hajj is said to have
Pilgrimage candidates to Saudi Arabia with the organization of the Presidency of Religious Affairs were greeted with prayers and tears at the Atatürk Airport External Lines Departure Terminal.
Before the movement of the first caravan of pilgrims, the ceremony, which was held at the International Terminal, was attended by about 200 pilgrim candidates, as well as their relatives.
On the other hand, Turkish Airlines (THY) has distributed roses to pilgrims on a scheduled flight to the holy land.
The Hajj Kafir in Ankara was dispatched from Esanbo<0xC4><0x9F>a.
Martyrs and veterans were also present in the caravan, who for the first time benefited from this year's "unparalleled pilgrimage for the gazis and the relatives of the martyrs".
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Camping
According to the statement of the Foreign Ministry and bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by police in Sithonia on the morning of 1 August.
They were released on the same day as the investigation was already underway.
The foreign ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened their control over free camping and are still punishing those who are caught resting in unreserved places for that purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The minister said the court could impose fines.
We're not going back to Holland until we find him.
JOEY Hoffman (22) traveled to Turkey with two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who traveled to Adana and Mersin in the car they rented, disappeared in Silifke on July 8.
When his friends, who had come with him, could not reach Hoffman despite all the calls, he informed his family in the Netherlands.
While the police were on their way to find the missing tourist, his brother, Robin Hoffman, and his friends, Angelo Durei, went to Jaimy Gewald Adana.
SNAKES DISTRIBUTE AND DISTRIBUTE
Robin Hoffman, who applied to the police here, printed the missing listings to find his brother and distributed them in Adana and Mersin.
Robin Hoffman said he last heard from his brother on July 8: “We first contacted the police in the Netherlands.”
Later, with two friends, we went to Turkey and called the police.
So far, we haven't heard anything, and we haven't found any clues.
“We will stay in Turkey until my brother is found, until there is news,” he said.
Congrats to World Second Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren
At the 2017 Crawler Swimming Youth World Championships held in Russia, national athlete Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilba<0xC5><0x9F> became the second in the world to 400 meters above water.
Minister of Youth and Sports Osman A<0xC5><0x9F>k<0xC4><0xB1>n Bak congratulated Ay<0xC5><0x9F>e Ceren Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilba<0xC5><0x9F>, who won the silver medal with his message.
On the first day of the 2017 Crawler Swimming Youth World Championship in Russia, Ceren Ye<0xC5><0x9F>ilba<0xC5><0x9F> became the second in the world to 400 meters above water.
Ceren took her place in the second place with a spectacular performance on the track where she competed with 8 finalists, while missing the gold medal with only 27 sales.
Elena Lopatina of Russia won the gold medal in 400 meters with a rating of 03.18.73 minutes, while Ceren won the silver medal with a rating of 03.19.00.
Turkey is represented by eight male and eight female athletes in the championship.
His last words were, “I think I’m dying, good-bye mom.”
Among those killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London, which has so far been announced to be 30, he called his mother during the fire and said, "I don't want to die, Mom, that's not fair."
"Thank you for everything you've done for me, good-bye," said Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend.
Dozens of people who were not heard of the fire were Gloria Trevisan, 26, who lived on the 23rd floor of the 24-story building, and her Italian lover, Marco Gottardi.
Maria Cristina Sandri, a lawyer for the Trevisan family in northern Italy, said in a statement that it was certain that the two young men had lost their lives, according to information obtained from British authorities.
Expressing that the parents of the young people were suffering a great deal, the lawyer also asked the journalists not to insist on getting an explanation.
I think I'm dying, good-bye, mom.
Lawyer Sandri said Gloria had called her mother Emanuela Trevisan on her cell phone shortly after the fire broke out, and she cried when she heard the last conversations she had recorded.
According to the report, Gloria Trevisan spoke to her mother several times during the two hours following the fire, which began around 1 a.m. local time.
Trevisan, who was calmer in his first speech, said, "Mom, something bad is happening here, there's a fire."
We're stuck, we can't go outside.
There's some smoke, but don't worry, we're waiting to be rescued.
“We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was a lot of smoke and the elevator was not working.”
Gloria Trevisan's latest words, which raised concerns in her subsequent searches as the fire grew, were:
Mom, my whole life is passing before my eyes.
I think I'm dying.
I had a life ahead of me; it’s not fair.
I don't want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't hug you again.
Thank you for everything you've done for me, good-bye, Mom.
I'm going to heaven and I'm going to help you from there.
It's the Italian government's fault.
Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend, Marco Gottardi, both studying architecture, had moved from the northern Veneto region to London in March, when she struggled to find a job after graduating last year.
Gloria Trevisan, who had only found a job in her country with a salary of 300 euros, soon began working in London for <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 (about 2060 euros) a month.
Lawyer Sandri said that Gloria Trevisan's family was going through financial difficulties, saying, "Gloria had gone to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people are forced to leave the country to save their future and find work.
“The government must find a solution to this problem immediately,” he said.
Italy's drama that doesn't provide jobs for young people
Gloria’s father, Loris Trevisan, also expressed his anger, saying, “This is the fault of our government that forced our young people to flee abroad to find work.”
In Italy, the unemployment rate reaches 12 percent, while the youth rate exceeds 40 percent.
Over the past few years, many young Italians have begun to emigrate to many European countries, especially the UK.
Last year alone, the number of young people forced to leave Italy due to unemployment exceeded 110,000.
Comments on the death of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi have been published in the Italian press, stating that this is the drama of a country that cannot provide jobs for its young people.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate IBH
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the U.K., causes stomach cramps and swelling, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While patients are often advised to skip meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the protein’s main amino acid, tryptophan, helps develop immune cells that develop a durable gut.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna said that immune cells patrol the intestines to prevent microbes hidden in food from sneaking into the body.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced with cells that promote stamina by protecting sensitive tissues without damaging them.
If the balance shifts too much to the inflammation, it can result from inflammatory bowel disease.
In the experiments, it was found that some kind of immune cell that promotes endurance in mice carrying a specific bacteria in their intestines.
And the bacteria needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger the emergence of cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between the bacterial species Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the gut microbiome, and the development of the cell population that promotes endurance.”
The mice who had more tryptophan in their diet had more of these immune cells.”
If the same is happening in humans, L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich diets could improve a more durable, less inflammatory bowel environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied a type of immune cell that improves endurance, and discovered that a group of experimental mice had these types of cells, but no other group of the same species, which were kept in a different place, had them.
He suspected that the difference was related to the mice’s gut microbiomes, in other words, the bacteria, viruses, and fungi communities that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
DNA sequences of the mice's intestines were performed and found that in mice with immune cells, there were six species of bacteria, but they were not.
Rats who lack an intestinal microbiome because they are cared for in a sterile environment and do not develop such an immune cell were given L. reuteri and immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred it to immature immune cells from mice in small amounts from this non-bacterial liquid.
Immune cells have evolved into cells that promote endurance.
The active ingredient turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid when it was purified from liquid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s food, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were reduced by half, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan said that humans have cells that promote the same endurance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in the gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known if tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri have developed in humans as well as in mice, but disorders in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
He said: "This is something that we probably want to encourage the development of these cells because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
“Potentially high levels of tryptophan in cases where L. reuteri is present are causing this population to spread.”
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
After the midfielder played his first match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic.
The <0xC2><0xA3>40m transfer from Chelsea began with a 2–1 win in Dublin ahead of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in United's last preseason match, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were in a position to keep the forwards in line.
However, Matic, who was left out of the Blues' pre-season Asia tour, had a serious lack of match condition and was only able to score 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that it needed to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his genius in the way he thinks, he thinks about football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner."
While Mourinho began to shape his first 11 for the start of the season, like Matic, his new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also played at Aviva Stadium.
This week, The Independent revealed that Mourinho still wants three more transfers, but the club has already insisted that he has done an "extraordinary job" by making three of his four priority transfers.
"Thank you to the club for taking three of the four," he added.
"I'd be happier if they took four out of four, but they put a lot of effort into it for me."
Last year, 197 people were hospitalized.
According to the data of the Swedish Social Welfare Authority, the diagnosis of gender dissatisfaction in 1 person in a hundred thousand people in 2005 increased to 8 in a hundred thousand in 2015.
The Astrid Lindgren Children’s Hospital was handed over last year to 197 children and young people, the majority of whom were dissatisfied with the gender it was born in.
Child psychiatrist at the same hospital, Louise Frisen, said the increase could be due to becoming a more open society, adding that "openness in the psycho-sexual field, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general improvement in society."
It is known that gender dissatisfaction has nothing to do with sexual orientation.
Drug Operation in Izmir
<0xC3><0x96>demi<0xC5><0x9F> County Police Department Smuggling and Organized Crime Struggle Bureau teams conducted an operation on the house of 36-year-old F.T. in <0xC3><0x9C>lker Sokak, 3 September Neighbourhood.
In the home search, a sensitive scale with 33 extacy pills was seized.
F.T., who jumped from the balcony and tried to escape, was arrested and detained.
It was noted that F.T. will be sent to the court after the proceedings in the security.
Transfer in Evkur New Malatyaspor
Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor, one of the new teams of the Süper Lig, tied wing player Turgut Do<0xC4><0x9F>an <0xC5><0x9E>ahin to his colors last season wearing Kas<0xC4><0xB1>mpa<0xC5><0x9F>a jersey.
According to the statement made by the yellow-black club, a 2-year contract was signed with the 29-year-old wing player as part of the transfer work.
“A 2-year agreement has been reached with wing player Turgut Do<0xC4><0x9F>an <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, who is wearing a shirt in Kas<0xC4><0xB1>mpa<0xC5><0x9F>a.
Good luck to our newlyweds," he said.
British inventor wears a microchip to enter his house and car
A British inventor became the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip to open his front door, access his office, and even drive his car with just one hand.
Steven Northam (33) has transplanted the tiny chip between his thumb and finger, and is currently offering this service to businesses and people who want to make their lives easier with technology through his company BioTeq.
To ensure that the implant procedure could be applied to medical standards, he collaborated with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hans.
The technology is similar to the microchip transplanted to cats and dogs and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam's company will also make changes to locks in homes and vehicles for <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock to be compatible with the chip.
The man, who is married and father of a child, has both his house and his BMW Z4 fitted with this technology, and his car is running while his hands are at the wheel.
White House protests cost thousands of taxpayers
According to military records released to TIME, the White House’s decision last month to fly a marine helicopter to the south for an organization that highlights American production cost taxpayers up to $24,000.
When the president boarded, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as the Marine One, was the focus of attention at the White House in the organization promoting American construction programs on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials visited all 50 states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was exhibited side by side with a yacht from Main, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War Department requested the helicopter's presence on an individual order (also called FRAGO) just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern grass for the "unusual" organization.
The commander of the HMX-1 sent an e-mail to his senior Marine Aviation Commander the day before the event, saying, "I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually high-visibility organization."
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive on the southern lawn around 7 a.m. on July 17 for the organization and stay there until the lawn cleared between 6 and 9 p.m.
The note added that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second flight crew would be needed for the return flight due to duty time restrictions.
The unit's security personnel were standing inside the aircraft while the original flight crew was in the helicopter at the time of the organization.
From the records provided to TIME, it's unclear whether a second flight crew is ultimately necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
Records show that the HMX-1 is investigating whether the organization violated this condition.
"A question we asked was whether he violated Hatch Law and we were notified that he did not," the commander wrote.
"It looks like you're locked up," answered the Deputy Commander.
The "Made in America" organization has been designated by the White House as an official organization and is not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even the official organizations have political insinuations.
In the organization, the president referred to efforts to reform health services that were then underway in the Senate and praised efforts to restrain government regulations.
Using aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents need to use it to travel.
But it is unusual for them to be formally asked to be used only for the opportunity to take a photo.
Trump pointed out when his presidential plane went behind the scenes of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida in February, and his Twitter account was filled with messages about his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
White House deputy press spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said: “The White House is thrilled with the ‘Made in America’ exhibition, where American workers from all 50 states produce products made with American materials.
The HMX-1 crew often conducts training flights in the Washington area and exercises on the southern lawn to leave the U.S. President at the White House with a dot shot.
While Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 conducted 58 landings at the White House.
An official said the flight for the Made in America organization was counted on the need for air crew training during that month.
The unit helicopters flew an additional 11 hours that day for "support missions not related to the presidency".
The White House said the taxpayers did not charge any other number in the organization.
A spokesperson for Sikorksky said his companies did not participate in the arrangement for the helicopter to be displayed on the southern lawn.
The HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact expense incurred by the organization is difficult to determine.
But according to the Department of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense’s welcome rate to VH-3D is $24.340 per flight hour.
The unit records the aircraft’s flight time as 30 minutes from its base in Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico, Virginia, to both sides.
The White House claims that the actual operational cost of the helicopter is far below that.
"It is very misleading to make an expense to taxpayers based on estimates of the cost-repayment rate," Walters said.
"These rate estimates cover the sinking costs involved in staff, maintenance and annual expenditures."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the Department of Defense’s cost-sharing rates do not include staff costs, but include fuel, maintenance, and contract costs.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer had advocated the use of the helicopter for the organization.
"The main idea here is to showcase what's done in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I think it depends on the work of hundreds, if not thousands.
And I think we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, have worked tirelessly to make.
This is the right thing to do, to be ahead of him.”
It’s unclear if Trump interacted with the helicopter while roaming the southern lawns for the organization, but he stepped into the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump joked with the media about the company’s products in his fleet and addressed Sikorsky’s representatives.
"I know Sikorsky very well," he said, "I have three of them."

According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections could be representative if all segments of society, including women, play a role.
Nicholas Haysom, deputy chairman of the U.N. Assistance Mission, said hundreds of women competed in the provincial council elections, three women competed for vice president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters were women.
"Women's role cannot be overstated," he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections are only fully attended by women, and if they are included in all parts of the electoral process, they can be truly representative and reliable.
The Afghan provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban has threatened the electoral process, which coincided with the time when international military operations turned into advisory missions.
This year’s elections mark the first time a peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said the strong role of women will contribute to the democratic success of Afghanistan.
Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women from 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

McVitie's GMB worried about investment in Glasgow factory
A union is seeking reassurance from the executives of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie's that they will make a long-term commitment to the production at its Glasgow factory.
GMB Scotland said the company has remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross region.
More than 500 people work at the factory, where Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced, among other products.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said they have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the region over the past few years.
He added that if there is a change in their operations, employees and union representatives will be "first informed".
In a letter to the company's plant manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's to "resolve concerns that there is no funding for the modernization of production bands."
Drew Duffy, senior organizer at GMB, said: “The lack of clarity about the business needs of the facility’s general manager and the investment plan for Tollcross’s future is deeply worrying our members.
Generations of families have worked here and are concentrated in the local community and in the suburbs of Glasgow, a critical basis for adequate employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
From a business, salary, and welfare perspective, Brexit conditions, increased livelihood costs, and a chronic decline in production are urgently in need of a four-headed executive production presence at McVitie's, the eastern end of Glasgow.
A woman spokeswoman from Pladis said: “The facility manager at Tollcross received a letter yesterday from GMB Scotland and the company will respond directly because we value our commitment to workers and union representatives.
Two months ago at Tollcross, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives, where several issues were openly discussed.
Then we told our employees that, like all companies doing business in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, we were constantly reviewing our operations to stay competitive, which is true for all of our jobs and facilities.
“In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in production lines and operational developments.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility, and in the event of any change in our operations at the facility, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know.”
Necip and Utku in Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> for another 4 years
Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> Club extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran for 4 years.
In the section on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), which contains data on football players, Besiktas has extended a contract with the two players until 31 May 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the black-and-white team's infrastructure and made his first professional contract on 19 June 2008, started to wear the A team in the 2009-2010 season.
Born in 1991, he has played 254 official matches with Besiktas.
TFF website also reported that Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> had signed a contract with the goalkeeper Utku Yuvakuran, whom Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> included in the squad on loan last season, until 31 May 2021.
Utku was removed from his temporary transfer status as of August 1, 2017, and his license was renewed on August 2.
Utku Yuvakuran played for Be<0xC5><0x9F>ikta<0xC5><0x9F> last season in the under-21 league.
The young goalkeeper took part in only 2 Turkish Cup matches in a black-and-white uniform.
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s departure three years ago?
The La Liga side may have regretted their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t give up on Neymar after offering the <0xC2><0xA3>189 million release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of looting the world record three years ago?
With the Ligue 1 team ready to break the world transfer record, more than double the amount Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million, the sensational offer moved the summer transfer period.
With PSG’s proposed <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week salary after taxes, Neymar will be the world’s most expensive player and also the professional athlete with the highest earnings when the transfer is completed.
Although a source close to the Catalan administration insists that the club has always done its best to keep an eye on him since his arrival from Santos in 2013, Barcelona is known to be angry about the style of the proposal and Neymar's attempt to leave.
Was the football world warned by the PSG president about this scene three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in getting Blaise Matuidi to sign in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a harsh warning to all clubs seeking to sign one of PSG’s top players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're against them, we're going to contact their players," he said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign, they’re going to suffer the consequences.”
Spanish club Barcelona seems to have crossed that line earlier this summer, expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti.
The PSG has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian national to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona is feeling the repercussions of this interest by losing its greatest value, Neymar.
The penalty for failing to read
The defendants, Kenan Gülsen and Nait Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, who allegedly marched on the Imam Mustafa Baki of the Gültepe Mosque, who was reading and reading the selashes, "willingly and knowingly assisting the organization", "resistance to not doing the duty" and "injuring" Istanbul 22.
He was tried by the High Criminal Court.
From the defendants Gül<0xC5><0x9F>en, the court board, which decided to give up the complaint of the victim for "insulting the public officer for his duty" and, taking into account the manner in which the crime was committed, decided to impose a fine of 7,000 liras, gave the defendant Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz the task of preventing the victim from committing the crime by the date and time of imprisonment, taking into account the importance of the public opinion and the future of Turkey.
The committee decided that the prison sentence given to Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz should be turned into a 6,000-dollar fine.
After the two defendants were fined, the defendant's lawyers filed an appeal.
The case is being examined by the Istanbul District Court of Justice 23.
He's in the Penitentiary.
After completing their investigations, the department decided that the punishment imposed on the accused Kenan Gülshen was applied in the legal context, that the action was correctly described and that the application was complied with the type of crime stipulated in the law, and that the punishment was appropriate for the accused.
When the accused Nait Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz read the waterfall and met the imam Mustafa Baki, who came out of the mosque, he said, "You don't throw the waterfall, or the flood, or the people into the street."
The president is taken.
"This work is finished," he said. He stated that the crime of "resistance to not do the duty" was committed by admitting that his act of attempting to walk on him, to shoot him, caused the victim's imam to be unable to read the ezan and salaah which he should be reading at certain intervals.
Although the grounds have been set by the local court, the apartment states that the action took place when the victim finished the reading task and informed the public in front of the mosque. In the concrete case, the victim stated that there was no duty that he had begun or continued to perform, that he had to prevent the public duty that this act carried out, and that he had not been able to control the victim in the manner in which he had deliberately attempted to injure the victim.
The defendant has no criminal record, the defendant has no concrete material damage due to the crimes committed against the defendant, and the department said that the moral damage does not constitute an obstacle to the application of the declaration of the sentence and that the victim has resigned from the complaint.
The Court of Appeals of the defendant Nait Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz's lawyer on the grounds of these grounds, the apartment, which considered the appeal claims of the defendant Nait Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, decided to violate the judgment given about the accused and to return the case to the first-degree court.
6 Europeans on Interpol's suicide bombing list
German newspaper Die Welt reported that Interpol sent a list of 173 potential suicide bombers on behalf of the terrorist organization Daesh to law enforcement in Europe last May.
The 132 people on the list were from Iraq, North Africa, Gulf countries, Tajikistan and Bangladesh.
The six people on the list are European citizens.
They are said to have come from Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Bosnia.
The man with the Daesh connection from Germany was reportedly a 27-year-old German citizen from the city of Solingen, North Rhine-Westphalia.
In the autumn of 2012, the person was reportedly travelling to Egypt, then Turkey, and finally Syria.
Daesh said in a statement on its social media accounts in mid-July that the person had died in Raqqa.
The German police have not responded to the newspaper's questions on the subject.
The names on Interpol's list were allegedly seized during operations against Daesh in Mosul.
According to Die Welt, U.S. intelligence agencies reviewed the list and sent it to Interpol.
Interpol also reported the list to police in Europe in May.
According to Die Welt, based on German security circles, ISIS may have attempted to send some of the names on this list to Europe to carry out suicide attacks.
