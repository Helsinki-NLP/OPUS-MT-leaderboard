You are a very special girl.
You are a very special person.
Whatever you do, you'll get it.
You are out.
Your efforts will bear fruit.
Your efforts will continue to produce results.
You are my friend.
You are out.
you are right.
you're still young.
Your generosity is truly a great asset.
Your anger is killing me.
You need to eat more.
You need to sleep.
YouTube is not a good website.
