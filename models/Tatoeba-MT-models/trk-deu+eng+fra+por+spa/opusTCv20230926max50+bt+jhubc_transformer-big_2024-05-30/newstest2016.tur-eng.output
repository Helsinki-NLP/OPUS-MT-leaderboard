Professor Calls 911 to Admit He Killed His Girlfriend
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told the police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun, and the police’s voice was just a little quivering.
Lamb said his "love dog" was alive and probably sad, and that the deceased's family's phones could be found on the woman's cell phone.
The police found Amy Prentiss's dead body at home and a handwritten note on a white notebook: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could bring everything back, I loved Amy so much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me."
There was no evidence that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus, where he thought police loved history professor Ethan Scmidt had also been shot and killed by Lamb in front of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said the university officials heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb's deadly 911 call was made shortly after that, he said.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as the police approached him.
The day after the school shooting caused students and professors to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still investigating what prompted Lamb to do so.
Details drawn by investigators on both sides of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, painted a talented but probably troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to her class.
A policeman in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said Lamb had no criminal or criminal record.
Schmidt even referred to Lamb as one of the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
They both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students took lessons from both.
However, there were also signs that there were spiritual problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who spoke highly of Lamb, said he was also a nervous and anxious person, and that he seemed to have "something wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb had told him he was struggling with stress in the late 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked for a sick leave from Delta State University, stating that he had some health problems.
This year, she only taught two classes online.
Recent changes in the University’s recruitment policies could not automatically guarantee that Lamb would become a full-time faculty member despite his doctoral degree, which he worked hard to earn.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it's clear there's something in Lamb's mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campus was evacuated, police tracked Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Forensic Investigation Director Methel Johnson announced that Lamb had committed suicide with a single .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house in Greenville, Mississippi, about a mile from his family's home.
Lamb's car was found on the freeway.
While it is not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived in the house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at the city’s 3,500-student university in 2009 and taught geography and education.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic, and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 years old and Lamb was 20.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a nice guy who tried to teach her how to play guitar for a few years.
At the time, he was a quick heart beater.
Hairston, now 40 years old and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon City, said of Lamb, “When he arrived, all the girls melted.”
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for a while.
When Lamb said "I killed my wife" on the 911 call, there's no official record of them getting married.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the edge of a river in Gautier.
Police said the dog was in good condition.
Prentiss’s ex-husband, Shawn O’Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but he and Prentiss remained friends and now have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also said his daughter was completely devastated.
He and his mother were great friends.
He said he had never met O'Steen Lamb but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail were performing at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together at the generals.
O'Steen stated that he wrote and sang his daughter's music himself.
Prentiss was a nurse working at various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dim bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5 after Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica to a small number of spectators.
There was no sign of a problem.
He said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we cut it off and threw a line at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same university, said that the murdered professor Schmidt led his first-year seminar program and was an expert in Native American and colonial history.
He was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was also the president of a student solidarity group he founded himself.
About 900 people attended the candle planting ceremony on Tuesday night at the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, including academics, university employees, students and visitors from the local community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and her brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the memorial service where the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Bright Elegance".
Classes continue on Wednesday.
LaForge said, “We’re trying to bring our students back.
The crisis is over.
Time to heal the wounds.

Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (in Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans) contributed to this story.
This news text was corrected to reflect the fact that the police stated that Lamb had called 911 after killing Schmidt and Lamb referred to Prentiss as his "wife" in his 911 call, but there was no official evidence that the two were married.
Toys R Us to recruit fewer holiday season players
Toys R Us has announced that it will not hire as many holiday season employees as it did last year, but the toys and doll products manufacturer said it will allow its current employees and seasonal workers to work more.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, up from 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said interviews with the candidates will begin this month and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although the holiday season is months away, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to equip their stores to help them sell, send and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox makes jokes about his relationship with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also important for personal reasons.
In the trailer for the upcoming documentary, Back in Time, she says: “We were sitting in the cinema waiting for members of the Royal Family to arrive, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I knew that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me.
The movie started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was just a fake stretching and arm stretching away from me.
A documentary about "Back in Time" includes interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future was first released 30 years ago.
"This is the most exciting time-travel film ever made for me," Spielberg said.
In addition to the Back in Time VOD and DVD formats, it will also be shown in some select cinemas.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
Regarding Russia's growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the nearly five-year-old Syrian problem "cannot be solved by military intervention" and that more weapons would only be more violence and pain for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together and hold constructive talks to find a political solution to the problem.
Ban said at a press conference Wednesday that he plans to meet Syria with the foreign ministers of the five permanent councils of the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom and France at the UN General Assembly, which will be held towards the end of the month.
He said he is deeply saddened that the division between the council members and the Syrian people has made the regional powers "unresolved" the issue.
Ban has called on five permanent members to join forces in the Syrian crisis as well as in the Iran nuclear deal.
8 polls that show Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to label it as iridescent.
The others looked at him as a joke.
And some of them are supporting the internal explosion.
While some Republicans have tried to bring Donald Trump down in the polls, it hasn’t worked (as of yet).
The 11 most recent national polls have shown him the leadership of Donald Trump in double digits, and some are seriously starting to question the chance of the real estate emperor being nominated.
Of course, it's still early in the election cycle.
None of this means Trump can win the Republican nomination.
Experts say that Rick Perry’s rise during this period in 2011 led to a rise for Herman Cain, both of whom failed to win the nomination process in a single state.
And there are a lot of reasons why he would have trouble in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC group and the Growth Club, the economic conservative group, are realizing Trump’s lasting power and are starting to spend their dollars to topple him.
Here are some recent survey results that show that the real estate emperor is only temporary:
Trump’s preference rates have changed 180 degrees.
A poll conducted at the University of Monmouth just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed that two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate emperor.
In mid-July, it was 40 percent.
It was 52% in early August.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Three out of roughly 10 say they have a negative outlook.
And these numbers are high in the early stages.
Last week, a poll in Quinnipiac, Iowa, showed that 60 percent of Republicans there prefer Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters may be satisfied with the Trump nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be “excited” or “satisfied” if Trump ran.
Only two out of ten said they would be "sad" if he was nominated.
Only Ben Carson is embracing the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% said they would be “embracing” and 40% for Trump).
The other person closest to the ecstasy?
It's only 21% Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters said they would be "dissatisfied" or "sad" if the institution's favorite, Jeb Bush, ran.
The majority of Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been criticized for his pompous language and insults, according to Monday’s ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republicans questioned believe the real estate emperor has the right temperament to become president.
The same is true in Iowa, where the country's first party congress will be held, where 52 percent of Republicans believe he has the personality to lead, according to last week's Quinnipac.
Still, 44 percent don’t think he has the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t suit the White House.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When political experts wear their hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who was the best candidate to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 people said Trump was the best, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
A change since late July when four out of ten people invested their money in Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal ball of the GOP voters was not very clear.
During the last election cycle at the time, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would run for office, while only 28 percent opted for Mitt Romney, who eventually ran.
The majority of GOP voters still seem to think Trump’s election campaign is plausible.
Even if Republicans gather around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the scattered area could also contribute to Trump’s prominence, and it’s true that anti-Trump support has been distributed among more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey conducted in early September shows that in the event of a head-to-head match between Trump and many Republican candidates, Trump gets the support of the majority each time.
He beats Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points each.
He's in a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In the event of a possible one-on-one, Ben Carson beats the businessman by 19 points.
The vast majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have made their decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday shows more than half of voters who support Trump say they have locked their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say that it won’t change their mind.
46% said they left the door open to change candidates.
Still Trump’s biggest rival is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve made their decision are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “violent” in his campaign announcement speech two months ago, immigration has been the topic at the beginning and center of the 2016 conversations.
Some believe that Trump’s much-talking has pushed important Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and would damage rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the issue of immigration remains on the agenda, Trump seems to remain on the agenda.
Anger against the government is escalating to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson receive roughly half of the Republican vote, largely because of their external status.
In a new ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they want an outsider instead of someone with government experience.
And they're mad at Washington.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa showed that three out of every four Republicans in Iowa were angry with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "extremely angry".
Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn will appear on the podium for the first time
Since he was elected, Mr. Corbyn's appearance on the Prime Minister's Questions program has been eagerly anticipated.
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will stand for the first time in the Prime Minister's Questions after David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly after noon, and his performance will likely be closely scrutinized by the media and Labour MPs.
At the weekly show, he called for "less theater and more reality".
He also said he could skip some sessions, leaving them to his colleagues.
The match will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, followed by his appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's silence during the reading of the national anthem at the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has also been criticized by some Tory MPs and is the focus of front-page news in newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national anthem drew attention
Speaking on behalf of Mr. Corbyn, a spokesperson said he stood in a "respectable silence" and appreciated "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the English War."
But Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet member, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's News Night that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief in the abolition of the monarchy.
Mr Corbyn’s senior team, which had about a dozen shadows due to differences in economics, defense and foreign relations, refused to serve, while fewer than a sixth of those in the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that policy differences within the Labour Party have also begun to "clump" and are issues of Mr. Corbyn's appointment to a position in the European Union and the government's upper limit on aid.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party has introduced new amendments to completely lift the upper limit.
Hours later, the shadow work and pension minister, Mr Smith, said the party was only opposed to the government lowering the top limit of <0xC2><0xA3>23,000, which is <0xC2><0xA3>26,000, and was "very clear" about it.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face in the House of Commons since David Cameron became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader promised a different approach to politics and said he was "popular" and had received more than 30,000 advice to ask Mr. Cameron.
The Islington North MP told the Prime Minister that the Questions program is very confrontative and will focus on poverty, inequality, and the challenges faced by young people, rather than making a sarcastic exchange of "answer-raising" and sarcastic promises.
When Mr Corbyn was absent, for example, when Mr. Cameron was on a trip abroad, he told the Prime Minister that in the Questions program he would be represented by shadow trade minister Angela Eagle.
From time to time, he even suggested that other colleagues should take the stand, saying he had applied to House Speaker John Bercow to address the issue.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron often told the Prime Minister that he wanted to move away from politics in the "Puppet Game" style, which was associated with the Questions program, but he admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since its first publication in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questions program has been used as a key measurement point to measure leaders' decision-making ability, their dominance in the House of Commons, and their position among MPs, while some critics have stated that it has been caricatured and that extensive reforms are needed.
'Photographed in Joburg': Homeless teenagers studying photography
The city centre of Johannesburg is a challenging place for homeless people.
But a group of old street kids have found a way to gain a new talent and make a living.
I was filmed in Joburg, a non-profit studio that teaches homeless teenagers to take pictures of their neighborhood and earn income from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the first graduates of the project.

<0xC2><0xA3> rises as wage increases accelerate in the UK
Following data showing an increase in wages in the UK, the pound saw a rapid rise, while the FTSE 100 index rose following a purchase offer for SABMiller.
Salaries with the exception of premiums in the UK increased by 2.9% between May and July compared to the same period of the previous year.
This rate, which represents the fastest growth since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest rates.
The sterling increased to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,505 by more than 1% against the US dollar and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,3730 by 0.84% against the euro.
The FTSE 100 Index increased by 1.49% to 6.229.21 points.
The company that stands out the most in this rise was SABMiller, which saw an increase of 20% in its attractive bid to buy from its rival AB InBev.
This offer will merge the two largest beer companies in the world, and well-known brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% due to positive profit news from rival luxury retail group Richemont.
Richemont’s current sales figures have risen above expectations, as well as showing that sales have begun to rise again in China, one of the key markets for Burberry.
Mining giant Glencore’s shares rose by 5% after the company announced that it had received $2.5 billion from its allocated share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Packing and paper group Mondi's shares were among the stocks that lost the most value after Goldman Sachs lowered its offer to "Sales" with a loss of 4.3%.
JD Sports’ shares rose 3.1 percent after the company announced that its six-month pre-tax profit had risen to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million, an increase of 83%.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries could hurt expansion
Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the Board of Directors of JD Sports, said the higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers".
However, he said that this spending power could not, according to him, exceed the high employee costs of his own company.
He added that the costs would affect JD Sports’ expansion plans, which could mean less extra work.
Metcash launches public campaign to fight Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash has launched a popular campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against the $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open the first of its two distribution centers and 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationship with local food suppliers and trying to build the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide fair.
IGA retailers and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo, which offers flavor testing in IGA stores, and shop owners who sell South Australian football league tickets at a discount to their loyal customers.
Metcash, a food, beverage and hardware wholesaler, is expected to present more details about its defense strategy as it improves its annual investor strategy day on September 29.
The risk is huge, as South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30% of Metcash’s IGA store footprint and produce higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
South Australian and Western Australian store owners are negatively narrow-minded and enjoy a much stronger market share than IGA retailers have achieved in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30% more in GA and 24% more in BA than in Eastern states.
But analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take over about 5% of the market within 12 months of opening its first stores in the two states, taking sales from existing players, but in general, non-retailers.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose $360 million in a year and Metcash would lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This prediction is based on Aldi’s prediction that next year he will open 25 stores in GA and 30 in BA, earning $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.
The loss of food and market sales and Metcash’s high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash about $13 million in profits before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing its market share in eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles, despite recent Roy Morgan research that revealed that IGA customers are the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash’s food and grocery sales will decrease by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, reducing its market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, said at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash could “probably be erased within a decade.”
Metcash declined to respond to Mr. Douglass' comments.
However, it appears that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has dropped from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash’s earnings from the food and grocery business, which supplies nearly 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, indicating a decline in business leverage as sales and margins come under pressure.
But the wholesaler resists, investing more than $150 million a year in Coles and Woolworths for face-to-face shelf prices each week, helping IGA retailers renew their stores, adding more fast-growing fresh foods, and opening a better range of private labeled markets to the public.
Metcash executive chairman Ian Morrice says price matching and store renewal programs are starting to yield results, and the wholesaler is expected to return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backed by Steve Healy, President of Tennis Australia
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
According to Steve Healy, president of Tennis Australia, Thanasi Kokkinakis was an accidental victim of the last storm that broke out around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and deserves more praise than criticism.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo, normally referred to as the "Special Ks," found himself under spotlights that were unwelcome for Kyrgios' disgraceful crush on Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
During the tough elimination match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison were separated by the referee twice, Harrison explained: "Wawrinka has come over Kyrgios, and I must go over that boy."
The last time Kokkinakis was seen at the US Open potentially breaking his racquet to annoy Richard Gasquet, he was loyally defended by Healy.
The young player currently competes with Sam Groth in Glasgow for the second singles position behind Bernard Tomic against Britain in the Davis Cup semifinals.
Healy said, “What I feel quite enthusiastically is that I think a little bit of Thanasi is being drawn to the discussion.”
In the U.S., he broke his racquet when he was blocked and lost, but he's not the first player to break a racquet because he's disappointed with himself, and I know Thanasi knows enough that he shouldn't be proud of it.
But in reality, in the US, he handled himself quite well with Harrison and others under extremely provocative conditions, and I think he deserves a lot of praise.
He's got a great team around him, a great family, and I think he's been a little too hard on himself.
Although he is 19 years old, he is extremely mature, he works hard and adapts to the team, he has no problems with other players, he is well-respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is a very balanced and mature young man, and he deserves to be judged according to his own criteria.
Healy also supported his decision to tolerate Kyrgios for a significant draw; starting Friday, he began explaining that what was right for everyone was to "reciprocate" but to support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
"First of all, we want the team to focus on the entire game, not on the rivalry around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And in my opinion, as people like Nick, Federer and Murray have pointed out, the kid has risen very fast, he has grown up in the public eye, and he has made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we’re trying to support him, we’re trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he’s not under the spotlight, he thinks deeply that my thinking is appropriate, that it’s best for the team and for him.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and arrests migrants
Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, declaring a state of emergency to curb the flow of migrants, and detained those attempting to enter the country illegally.
The accumulation of hundreds of migrants in the neutral zone created chaos on the border and Serbian authorities acted in anger.
Migrants fleeing violence in their own countries set up tents on the side of the road for an indefinite period between the checkpoints of the two countries.
But his anger was growing.
As a police helicopter was passing above, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian agile police.
Some refused to accept the food and water they were given.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" for Hungary to return migrants as the flow of migrants from Macedonia and Greece continued.
He wants to be part of the solution, not to be hurt by this process.
In the coming days, talks with Brussels and other countries will need to be held,” said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
This tension on the Hungarian-Serbian border occurred a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common migrant policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who almost attacked Greece and Italy, and expressed hope that by the end of the next month or year, an agreement would be reached to welcome 120,000 more migrants, including those coming from Hungary, into the EU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an EU summit next week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
Hungary, on the other hand, is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbors will take any concrete steps on the issue.
The emergency call, issued Tuesday in the two southern regions, gives authorities broad powers to tackle the crisis, including blocking roads as needed and accelerating cases involving asylum seekers.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country plans to draw barbed wire along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants from Serbia after the barbed wire was pulled from the border with Serbia.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata announced that even inmates in prisons have been assigned to try to pull barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become an important narrow gateway and point of passage to the European Union countries, and many of these migrants are refugees fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of migrants are “economically motivated migrants” who are trying to move to Europe for a better life, rather than innocent people who come to flee the war – a view that is completely opposite to the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws enacted at midnight in Hungary have imposed harsher penalties on human traffickers, as well as making it a crime to cross or damage a 4-metre (13-foot) long barbed wire pulled from the Serbian border.
In a statement to journalists in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring an emergency."
One thing is clear: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
While the deployment of troops still needs to be approved by the parliament, the Associated Press reporters in the area have been saying they have seen dog and vehicle soldiers armed with heavy weapons here for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 people entering the country.
They passed by damaging the barbed wire, and now they're in police custody and charged with committing crimes under the new law.
The authorities are quickly repairing the barbed wire.
Hungarian authorities also used a train wagon covered with barbed wire to close one of the crossings on Tuesday morning, while closing two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia.
Chaos was also reflected in the main border crossing point near Roszke, when Hungarians commissioned a small metal container where people were crowded to make transactions.
Twenty people were allowed in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of migrants said they would not accept food and water aid until they were allowed to enter Hungary by blocking the highway connecting Serbia with Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's supremacy over Bernie Sanders cut by half in national elections
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead the two-digit Democratic race for the national nomination, but you. Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is currently in second place with 47% of Democracy votes (reduced from 58%), while Sanders is in second place with 27% (reduced from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is in the presidential race, receives 15% of the democratic vote.
More than five months before the start of the main races, most Democratic voters said it was too early to decide which candidate they would support.
But Clinton’s supporters have more solid ideas about their own choices than any other candidate.
Since last month’s CBS News, Clinton has been losing ground between a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has some gains.
Clinton is in the lead with a big difference between women and moderates, but that difference is closing.
Men's support has dropped dramatically, and Sanders is only five points behind him.
Clinton’s advantage of the Democratic voter under the age of 50 has evaporated, and he and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton is in the lead by a big margin in terms of older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sander with two-digit margins among the liberals, but now Sanders is five points ahead of this group.
Nearly half of the national-level democrats say they will passionately support Clinton if she becomes the party's candidate.
One quarter will support it under certain conditions, while another 15 percent will only support it if it becomes a candidate.
Six percent do not support Clinton.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters tend especially to support him passionately.
The views among those who do not currently support Clinton are even more confusing – only a quarter could passionately support it.
48 percent of Democrats say they will passionately support Clinton, while fewer Republicans are talking about their leading candidate, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters were asked open-ended questions about why they wanted Clinton to run, the first-line answers were that she had the right experience (16 percent), that it was time to elect a female president (13 percent) and that she was the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also expressed their relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).
Being conciliatory in problems and selectability are among the criteria mentioned.
As a vice president with the potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democrat voters would like to see him in the race, but a third of voters don’t think so.
When Democracy voters were asked what their second nomination for the party was, Biden was on top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden could have a second election, Sander said.
If Biden doesn't enter the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's dominance over Sanders increases, from 20 points in a race with Biden to 30 points in a race without Biden.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election, but that figure dropped from 78 percent last month.
Although Biden is second in this regard, he is far behind, but the percentage of those who see him as the most selective candidate has increased.
Once again, when asked what is the most important thing in a candidate, Democrat voters put issues ahead of electoral eligibility.
Similar to last month, no Democrat candidate or candidate seems to be unacceptable as a candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates perform well in some of the main characteristics among the primary voters of their own party.
The majority see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as being honest and trustworthy, as well as having strong leadership qualities.
While Biden ranks first among the three in terms of honesty, Clinton is strong in leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say Clinton is not honest and trustworthy, and about half of them say the same for Sanders (15 percent), while 27 percent have no idea.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as aligned with their ideology.
A quarter of all the Democrats have no idea about Sanders.
While questions about his use of his personal email address and server during his tenure as Secretary of State continue, most Democratic voters find the explanation to be satisfactory and say their views on him are not affected.
But this is a different story in the general American public.
While half of Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, only one-third find them satisfactory.
The public's views on this issue were divided in March, shortly after the issue was taken under the eye.
Most Americans say email disputes don’t affect their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent say they have increased their negative opinion.
These are Republicans in general, and more than six in 10 say their views on Clinton have been distorted.
Although Clinton is seen as being honest and trustworthy by the voters of her own party, this is still a problem for registered voters in general: only 32% consider her to be honest and trustworthy, while that figure has fallen by eight points compared to last month and by 15 since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not find him honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump are getting good grades on leadership.
Among the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson and Bush received the best points on honesty.
More often he finds Sanders honest, but as with Carson, most don’t have an idea of him.
The margin of error in samples from 351 Democrat voters is 6%.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in national polls
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson is running behind Donald Trump.
The new poll shows that the two candidates account for about half of the votes, while the other candidates have little chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with support from 23% in the last CBS poll before the debate on Fox News last month climbing to 27% in the poll announced on Tuesday.
But support for Carson rose from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson was doing well in demographic groups, with support among college-graduated Republican voters much higher than Trump.
With the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, Wisconsin's Governor Scott Walker is now down 2% from 10% last month.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
The most recent poll of 376 Republican voters had a margin of error of 6%, and the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson’s support for Republicans to 19%, just behind Trump’s 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post showed Trump seriously in front of Carson.
Faced with Carson’s rise last week, Trump apologized for questioning Carson’s faith, but continued to shake the retired neurosurgeon at random.
At a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said last Saturday that “we need energy.”
Five members of the Baruch College have been charged with the death of a first-year student.
Nearly two years after the death of a college student during a fraternity admissions ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, murder cases were opened against five people.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng at an initiation ceremony in September 2013 and contributed to his death by delaying his drive to the hospital, according to police.
Authorities reported that his eyes were tied, he was stuck on a backpack full of 30 pounds of sand, and he was constantly twitching as he tried to walk toward the target on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that over time his head hurt, and then he lost consciousness.
The Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 after Deng fainted, and police said they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
But according to Police Commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at a press conference, they changed Deng’s clothes, searched for his symptoms on Google and contacted Andy Meng, the brotherhood’s national president, for advice.
At this point, the members began to hide personal belongings and put the brotherhood's goodwill ahead of Michael Deng, said Commissioner Wagner.
He could not be revived and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng was traumatized by repetitive blows to his head, torso and hip with a sharp object.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement that as a result of the Brotherhood admissions ceremonies, many families have been destroyed, with at least one student dying in admissions each year since 1970.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step taken by the authorities is very important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County has recommended that the first five members be prosecuted for a third-degree murder charge.
Thirty-two members of the fraternity, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with the admission ceremony and criminal conspiracy.
At a press conference Tuesday, Wagner said, “We will hold not only those involved, but also those who have formally or unofficially approved it.”
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity ended its relationship with the local unit.
What will happen when the Fed raises interest rates?
With the rise of interest rates, the bull market is upside down, bond revenues are climbing, and the economy is going down.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long all this will take and how long.
History, especially in the economy, offers little information about timing.
The recession lasted as long as 86 months, as it did in as little as 11 months after the initial interest rate increase.
The U.S. Central Bank’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates has often been decisive in response to economic and financial assets, if not consistently.
This is why US central bank officials strongly emphasize that investors should focus on how long the normalization process will last, not when interest rates will start to rise.
It's a fact that there are various variations.
However, market participants may think that the urge to raise interest rates has been exaggerated.
"It is inevitable that the Fed's first interest rate hike since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the 'cheap money' era," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics.
On the contrary, we do not expect U.S. interest rates to gradually return to normal, but it appears that there is a seismic blow that most of the levels that are still low are afraid of.
But we can't say it won't have any effect.
Based on past trends, some areas of the economy may react as follows:
As seen in the past months on the market, waiting for interest rates to rise can destabilize things for a while.
As soon as interest is raised, the effect is not so obvious.
In a new study on what will happen after Fed increases, Deutsche Bank analysts said: “It appears that equity returns are a stagnation trend for 12-24 months after the initial interest rate hike, which may reflect a stagnation in monetary policy.”
According to a recent analysis shared by Nuveen Asset Management analyst Bob Doll at Barron's, the market has generally recorded sharp rises over the past 35 years – around 14 percent – and is moving in a straight line towards a rate increase after 250 days (average 2.6 percent increase) and 500 days after that, it has returned to normal and yielded an average return of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the impact on the shares became more pronounced in the later stages of the interest-raising cycle, and the return was about to disappear.
Regression is a fact of economic life, but interest increases also help them.
The Fed, in its current state, is facing some situations that have not previously existed and will accelerate the decline.
The most striking is that the gross domestic product is at the lowest level so far for the Fed's interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 interest rates increase since 1950, gross domestic product fell below 4.5 percent only twice a year from nominal year to year.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, the Atlanta Fed expects this to be permanent, with the third quarter at 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic environment can be risky and lead to the question of whether it will be different this time.
Market participants, who have been waiting for the Fed’s interest rate hike for a year, are paying attention at this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.
While most strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, futures trading only points to a 25 percent probability.
"In our research since 1950, all the increase cycles that have taken place to this day are in a super-rising trend cycle, with gross domestic product rapidly reaching pre-rebound peaks after the recovery that began," the report said.
On the contrary, it was a slow recovery from the worst recession that ever happened in an exemplary period.
The current cycle is the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the last recession - the longest one on record has been 35 months, and the current one is in its 74th month.
With the expected interest rate increase in the market, fixed income has become unstable, and the order is somewhat like that of equity.
The main difference is that when the Fed changes the course of its policy, the effect is seen much faster than in bonds.
When the first increase/fall of the cycle arrives, bond returns do not immediately change direction.
At the end of the interest-raising cycle, bond yields drop instantly," Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab strategists, increases in interest rates will flatten the tilt, bringing the returns between longer and shorter bonds closer.
“We’re still careful about reaching returns,” said Schwab analyst Kathy Jones, who said high-return bonds in analysis often perform better in an environment like this.
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adapting to the Fed’s policy expectations.
“In addition to the decline in dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is regulated according to stricter monetary policy,” he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are on the rise, the yield curve is smooth, credit spreads have expanded, and the surge has increased – all the features to be seen on the market when the Fed tightens its policy.
From a broader perspective, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will gain interest rates and local products will be more attractive.
Multinational companies that have a lot of debt will be worse off, because increasing dollar products will make them more expensive on the global market and their debts will be even more expensive.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks may experience performance declines at the beginning of such an increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for their customers.
Companies with strong balance sheets surpassed those with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percent following rates increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital gains and low fluctuating stocks also surpassed their low-quality competitors with an average of 4 (3%).
Debt will become a big issue.
According to Goldman, companies with high fluctuating exchange rate debts are the most likely to suffer the most damage.
Apart from the pure exchange game, consumers are also expected to benefit from the increased dollar.
Although experts have differing opinions on how fast to keep it, savingspeople can also benefit from high gains.
Andrew Bingham said a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses station of 'disturbing'
He argued that the radio became more and more unlike its commercial competitors.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused her of defrauding the Brit Awards.
His deputy colleague Damien Collins has accused The Voice of being unoriginal.
A forward-looking deputy pressured the broadcaster to reveal its difference to other commercial stations, saying that BBC Radio 3 was increasingly "converting" Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham said the radio channel, which provides public service to the BBC bosses, was "spreading" and increasingly becoming like its commercial competitors.
"I don't like to use that term, but Radio 3 is getting 'rapid', it's becoming Classic FM," he said.
The first one also targeted the BBC Music Awards held in December.
Another version of the BBC Music Awards Brit Awards, launched last year.
"So if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to mind, and you're holding and copying what's already on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC’s director general denies the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is clearly ahead of its commercial competitors in terms of live music and public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to learn anything about classical music from anywhere else.
And that's the commitment to live music, and music can't be compared to anything else.
I also think that the efforts of Radio 3 to discover new music and promote the works are very important.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 executive Alan Davey claimed that in order to reach more audiences, the radio had to work harder than in the past because the British were less educated in classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only component of the BBC’s selection committee on Culture, Media, and Sports held the ball because it pressed on the tail of its commercial competitors.
MP Tory Damien Collins also teased O Ses - a music talent contest that the BBC had received royalty of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million from Dutch production company Talpa Media.
Can’t you see why the program makes so much noise, because it’s not original and there’s no special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was juryed by Paloma Faith and Boy George, was made in a "BBC-specific style".
He said he wished the agency would "find a hit of its own blood" before it could do another show of entertainment.
However, he did not accept the idea that in the future it would be possible to block the construction of more O Audio programs or spend the amount of the license fee on other formats.
Is Black Friday the reason Internet sales experienced the lowest increase in history in August?
In the first three months of 2015, Internet sales increased by seven percent.
Last month saw the lowest growth since 2000, when records began to fall.
Three years ago, mobile devices began to be used in shopping, Internet sales exploded.
Experts say Black Friday in November could be the reason for spending cuts
Online shopping has been booming for more than a decade, turning Britain’s liveliest shopping streets into a ghost town.
After only seven percent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts note that internet sales are showing signs of increasing weight loss.
August saw a five percent increase in total expenditure compared to last year, the lowest growth since 2000, when records began to break.
After only a seven percent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts note that internet sales are showing signs of increasing weight loss.
Andy Mulcahy, sales index editor for IMRG, told The Guardian: “If you look at the growth levels of the previous years and especially the 2000s, you’ll see that everything has actually returned to normal over time.”
Three years ago, when consumers started using mobile phones to buy products, internet sales were on the rise.
This meant that more people could shop even while lying on the couch.
But now it's going horizontal, you can see the landing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept borrowed from America, is cited as one of the reasons why sales are slowing down.
Experts say consumers may be waiting for this event, which took place on the last Friday of November, to buy something.
At last year’s event, when five times more consumers attacked companies’ websites to grab cheap products than the previous year, many companies’ websites collapsed.
Experts say Black Friday, which shows shoppers fighting for a discount, may have restrained shoppers "for now"
A study published by the British Retail Association found that <0xC2><0xA3>1 for every <0xC2><0xA3>5 spent on shopping is spent on buying products online.
A third of products such as TVs and washing machines are now available in online stores.
In addition, more than a quarter of people buy their clothes and shoes online rather than on fancy shopping streets.
With Bin Laden's family found guilty, Muslims bid farewell to those who lost their lives in the crane accident in Mecca on their last journey
The bodies of 29 people who lost their lives after the first funerals in Mecca were carried on the streets by Muslims
Saudi Arabia blames construction giant Saudi Binladin group for crane crash
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the bodies of 29 people who lost their lives after a crane fell into the Mosque of Haram.
The crowd, mostly white, blocked the roads to bid farewell to their first funeral at the Muaysim Cemetery in Mecca.
The painful mass passed through the sacred place where a crane collapsed the ceiling of the mosque a few days ago and fell on the pilgrims.
The bodies of the dead were brought to the burial after the Saudi kingdom blamed Binladin, the owner of the construction conglomerate, for the incident, which included 394 wounded.
The bodies of 29 pilgrims who died after a crane fell into the Mosque of Haram were carried on their shoulders along the way.
Among the dead was Kas<0xC4><0xB1>m Akram, a father of four children from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram had come to the Mosque with his parents at the beginning of the annual pilgrimage.
Saudi leaders said the Hajj will continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on their way to Mecca.
King Salman said today that the Binladin Holding group should not leave the crane open when it is out of use.
In the Arabic version of the decree prepared by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, Binladin Group is the only party to be blamed for the incident.
The news agency’s English service did not pass this detail, but the company’s officials informed that a curfew has been imposed abroad.
At the beginning of the week, Salman vowed that the crane would find the reason for its fall into the courtyard of the Mosque of Haram, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrived at the Pilgrimage at the end of the month.
The Binladin group did not make any statements about the overturned crane, and its representatives were not allowed to comment.
The royal decree accused the group of not taking up-to-date security measures and of not cooperating with meteorological officials.
The Mosque of Haram in Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes, most of which are under the leadership of the Binladin group.
Binladin's family has been in close contact with Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and is the head of most construction projects.
Al-Qaeda's last leader, Osama Bin Laden, was also a perverted son the family had deposed.
The accident occurred just a few days before millions of people flocked to the land of Hajj, where every adult Muslim was supposed to visit at least once in their lives, during a period of severe wind and rain.
Authorities say 158 people are still receiving treatment at the hospital.
Authorities ordered the families of the deceased and survivors with permanent disability to pay compensation of 1 million Riyal (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000).
The other wounded will receive half of that amount.
B<0x26>Q boss says East European artisans working cheaply behind this trend
Veronique Laury says the British are hiring more and more masters
Behind this increase lies the number of Eastern European master craftsmen
As a result, 200 new Screwfix stores are opening for craftsmen.
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B<0x26>Q sales points across the country.
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Chief Correspondent
The British are said to have abandoned their hammers and paint brushes to hire skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do housework instead.
If you're good at hammering or wall painting, you're in the minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B<0x26>Q, the British are increasingly employing masters to do DIY work at home.
Kingfisher’s new chief executive, Veronique Laury, owner of the home improvement chain, said there was a huge increase in the number of Eastern European skilled craftsmen offering low-priced services behind this trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to close 60 B<0x26>Q points, while opening another 200 new Screwfix stores for craftsmen.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted more women to be hired in B<0x26>Q stores because eight of the ten purchase decisions in the store were made by women.
Currently, the majority of staff are men.
He said there is a need to meet the evolving demographic trends seen in the single-woman home, which has improved more homes than in the past.
Ms. Laury said: “We still have mostly men working in our stores.
We need to balance even more.
Basically, half of our customers are women and 80 percent of the decisions made about purchased products are made by women.
Women play an important role in decision making.
Ms. Laury, one of five women at the head of Britain's leading firms index FTSE100, restructured her top team to include an equal number of men and women managers.
Kingfisher, including its chief executive and chief financial officer, is almost alone in this field with a full 50 percent female staff.
Ms. Laury said: “It was an informed decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn't hard to find good women to take to our board of directors.
After the group loaded the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher announced a drop in both lower monthly profits and sales.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, owner of Screwfix and B<0x26>Q, will open 200 new stores
Time for U.S. Central Bank to decide interest rate hike for Fed
The two-day meetings of the U.S. Central Bank on Wednesday and Thursday are being monitored by the world; a decision is expected ten years from now on whether interest rates will rise.
In a Reuters poll, more than half of the 80 economists said the Fed would implement the decision last week, but they now think it will suspend the decision and keep rates between 0 and 0.25%.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Fed reduced rates to zero.
Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said: “For the first time, we will see a large central bank come out of its zero point and begin the process of normalizing interest rates.”
The U.S. economy is performing relatively well, adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet in the process of revitalizing the economy, creating a small amount of inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less promising global picture.
He warned the markets against an increase, but there are indications that they believe the situation will not allow such an increase.
The decision will be announced Thursday at 8 p.m.
The perpetrator of the murder at Delta State University left a letter of apology.
Shannon Lamb left a note Monday morning in Mississippi saying she was "sorry" for the first murder before killing her girlfriend with a gun and later that same day, officials said, with a "if I can get it back" wish.
Mississippi Gautier police say Lamb, a geography and social science education instructor at Delta State University, called 911 around 10:00.
He said he said he shot and killed a man on Monday.
Lamb said he had to send the police to the caller.
"I killed my wife last night," Lamb said, adding that he also found a "sweet dog in the house that didn't hurt anyone" and that he was probably sorry.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't say his name.
Lamb didn't make any statements about the murder.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb: “I’m so sorry, I wish I could turn back time.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing this note, Lamb drove to Delta State, 300 miles away, killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, and then committed suicide when he was trapped by the police.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it's obvious that there's something in Lamb's mind."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed his girlfriend Prentiss was having an emotional affair with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that they had "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for nearly seven years, describes Prentiss as a "good guy".
The couple divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said Prentiss and her 19-year-old daughter had been found, and the girl was "in ruins".
O'Steen also stated that Prentiss and her daughter were "absolutely each other's best friends".
Linsday Knowless, described by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Parentiss, said Prentiss was working online from her home.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owns a hunting dog named Lightning, has been with Lamb for about 3 years.
Knowles said, “He always liked to help others.”
Police said Lamb called his relatives on Monday, saying he was “not going to jail.”
That same night, when the police approached him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled over, jumped on foot, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a CV published on the University’s website, Lamb received a PhD in education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their old charm
The actor (left) who was seen with his son Redmond (right) had a rather stressful few years.
In 2001, she struggled with leukemia, and in 2009, she sacrificed her life partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor, who is said to be fighting drugs, was arrested for possession of drugs in 2008.
All of this, of course, did him a lot of harm.
Manchester United’s Luke Shaw has been out for months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two fractures in a match where Manchester United defeated PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
The incident, which brought the defender to tears, left him out of the field for at least six months, while Louis van Gaal remained hopeful that Shaw would be able to return to the field this season.
The fracture was caused by a careless encounter with Hector Moreno in the 15th minute of a match where 20-year-old Shaw fell like a bomb on the field.
He was intercepted on the field for nine minutes and then needed oxygen before being transported to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "The pair is suddenly broken in the leg, and he's in the hospital."
Today or a day later, maybe he'll be dispatched and taken to surgery in Manchester.
It’s a terrible situation – a young man who has been transferred to Manchester at the age of 18 has to have a hard time first, then have a great game, and then this happens to him.
He was in the locker room with an oxygen mask on his face.
She's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double ground fracture, it's at least six months, and it means you can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get rid of the red card and the penalty shootout.
Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal claimed that the Italian authorities made a mistake.
You can judge yourself when I say it's a penalty and a red card.
It was a terrible fight with two legs.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages, there are not enough words to describe how disappointed I was, my healing path begins now, and I will come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United: Luke Shaw in PSV defeat is shocked by injury
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be a morale boost for the English defender.
PSV manager Phillip Cocu said: “It’s a very bad injury.”
If such an injury happens to any player, everyone will be saddened.
The intention of our players is never to cripple their opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture at the 2014 World Cup as he played for the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Netherlands.
Cocu finds this very difficult because he never intended to cripple his opponent, and after he heard that it was a very bad fracture, it was never good, he said.
For me, it was impossible to see that moment.
All I could see was the ball moving in a different direction, as if Moreno had touched it, but I couldn't see Luke's swing.
Moreno told SBS 6: "I know how it feels. I know how difficult it can be.
I feel so bad about this, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was hospitalized after a fight with Chris Smalling.
Of course, David Cameron knows the Lorax better than that.
This is something that every parent learns in a short time: when your child loves a book, you know it won’t take long for you to learn it almost by heart.
It seems that if you're not David Cameron.
When asked what his favorite children's book was by a holiday programmer provider for childcare, the prime minister chose The Lorax, a 1971 environmental tale by Dr. Seuss.
In a message posted on SuperCamps’ website, Cameron said: “I like to read this book with a funny, impressive, creative and powerful message to my children because it contains an image or message that we always skip.”
So far, everything was going pretty well, until Cameron wrote something about the contents of the book, but actually summed up in a 2012 film version of the book, where new characters and details were added to inflate the contents of the original fairy tale.
In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is destroyed, even air is commodity, a boy named Ted wants to realize his desire to see a real tree to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he writes, including a love story that Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, did not know.
If this doesn't sound suspicious enough, the text Cameron's handling is in some way very similar to the short summary of The Lora in the Internet Film Archive, which begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted wants to win the heart of his dreamy Audrey."
Judging by the claims that he is a competent parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron has heard of the main subject of the book, in which he hears that an unnamed young boy was destroyed by the local environment, a stud named Lorax, a mustache and a creature that "speaks in the name of trees," despite the objections of the greedy, tree-cutting, moaning once-in-a-lifetime.
It's likely that such a weak public relations job was handed over to a servant of the order, who apparently hasn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A spokeswoman for the presidency said the text was thought to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was sourced from Cameron's staff, but made no further comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of Britain's extradition, but he's still intact.
Playing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a challenging task, but I don't think there's a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeats last time after seeing the British team selected for the round.
Still, I'm not excluding a displacement win.
Alastair Cook’s team may be more inexperienced than they were three years ago, but they have good players on the strike line, and the collective sense of play is strong; they don’t heal 2012’s wounds, they only provide a little youth-induced optimism.
In the ball game, Moeen Ali develops as a game spinner, and Adil Rashid represents an attack option, even though its quality at the Trial level is unknown.
Related: Adam Lyth left the UK Trial team and was replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to remove Adam Lyth is a difficult one to analyze for me as head coach in Yorkshire.
The Seven Trials was against two good strikes in harsh conditions, and the simple but inevitable fact is that cricketers are judged by the outcome.
For example, there was no question about Joe Root, the announcement had to be made because – as I said before – the players were their own best choice.
After a few 50-point series, Lyth could see his career stretching, but he made his own.
If he works harder for Yorkshire, I hope he gets another chance.
UK head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player’s attitude, even though he did not perform well, which didn’t surprise me; first of all, he’s a teammate.
It’s hard to answer the question of how long it will take a Test scorer to get his grade.
Lyth – like Sam Robson before him – took seven caps, while Nick Compton took nine.
Only Compton had a rematch.
The only pain you can feel for Jonathan Trott may be that Britain went to the Caribbean first – while Lyth’s form was at its peak – but this wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and I think he's a high-level striker.
He's an X-factor cricketer, and we saw that early this season in Yorkshire when he scored 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
It should at least be taken for the same opportunity as before, but it depends on the team formation in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea for Moeen to open up next to Cook to get an extra game spinner while holding the four quicks worked, and I'm not against it.
I don’t understand why a striker can’t shoot here, and this left-hander has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done his job for the city of Worcestershire, but he saw a number three for them, and it doesn't make much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Trials in his first fall before starting his debut in 2001.
He immediately grabbed the three hundred-dollar series and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup game spinner and surprised me as an impressive young man in my limited interviews with him.
People can see their raw stats – 31 average in the shot and 35 average in the ball – and think it’s a degage, but there’s not a lot of game spinners raising their hands, and player selections are for the younger one.
He's going to learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, the UK seems to have made a few cunning additions to their coaching team.
The appointment of Sri Lankan striker Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the Test matches could be an ingenious measure.
He is one of the most adorable men in the game; he will bring with him a full experience in all circumstances and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming for the white ball leg of the round, giving both energy and a ruthless series to the game layout.
I’ve always thought he was born for the international cricket world, whether he’s a player or a coach, and he’s like Mahela with a sense of direction.
Sometimes new sounds in the locker room can bring the team something new, even if they convey messages that have been said before.
Colly’s teammate Ben Stokes from Durham is resting for a day’s games, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I’m okay with that.
While not everyone agrees, the plans are not made by coaches and those who choose players.
And you have to remember, like the players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
Brexit could win camp if the economy is stagnant by 2017
David Cameron's semi-cooked re-negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, even though Jeremy "Yes or No" Corbyn was elected to the Labour Party leadership, or TUC was outraged on Tuesday about Europe.
Strangers have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend of mine recently stated that some member states are tired of the agenda of divisive privileges and interfering treaty changes in the EU, which they don't want most of, which is entirely caused by them.
At his annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided that it did not want them if it damaged social protection.
In fact, it's Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in the capitals of foreign countries, take pictures of themselves in front of famous monuments there, whether prominent or not, and then return to their countries and gather allies for reform.
This is all about me.
When Berlin said, “Don’t leave us alone with France,” my European friend, who wanted an extroverted Britain in the EU tent, said that in some of the capitals, more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to a point where they no longer care whether we stay or not.
Germany's prudent and sane Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years, and, as in the case of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), she wants to leave before the situation worsens.
François Hollande faces a re-election or change of power in France in 2017.
It's a fading power.
Soon a left-wing government will take power in Poland and a right-wing government in Spain.
Selfie, which should use its energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, is unlikely for the British to make an effort because they don’t want it because most of them have secessionist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning to speed up the Brexit process by making deliberate statements that, in the style of the Scottish National Party, will not help the situation during the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign, my friend says.
"There would be no re-negotiation" and "Britain has achieved nothing that would benefit from re-negotiation."
Europeans know from their previous experience how exploitative Fleet Street was to the oligarchic press barons as opposed to the EU because they were not like that in the time of Tony Benn, but they were inspired by the 1975 referendum that ratified our entry in 1973.
That's how they remember Boris Johnson, the chief Euro-opportunist who was a Brussels correspondent in the early 90s, who made his name as "EU flat bananas".
All their stupidity aside, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them were anti-tax vagrants, foreigners who listened to illegal phone calls, and so-called foreign residents who owned most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair often thought the same thing about them, but when he was trapped in a cage with a horny gorilla, he realized that he had to distract himself by giving him bananas to avoid being eaten at lunchtime and tea time.
In fact, Miliband was Blair's opponent of Cameron's brilliant idea of a referendum, as Blair compromised the principle of the EU constitution, which was repealed in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who gave him a exit card.
The press never forgave him for that.
But a friendly pat on my back in Westminster on Monday—which I told him I had no time to lose—Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, seems to be in danger of reintroducing the strategy of boycotting Murdoch in the '80s, which was a mistake then and now.
While it will take time, he needs to develop a consistent strategy to stay in touch with the media, not me, especially Andrew Marr, who left the BBC chair on Sunday.
I kindly express Corbyn's official position in Europe as developing.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of the people outside of Ukip's hostile tendencies, and ardent supporters of Conservative Little England, say yes.
That's what Hilary Benn said on radio and television this week, as she naïvely forced herself to admit that it was a bad idea for Corbyn to appoint John McDonnell as the shadow chancellor.
This reminds me of his father's fight on television for disloyalty to his friends in the Labour cabinet in the '70s, not going too far, and his loss of office in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more appealing.
But in Benn's words - fighting to stay "in any circumstance" - was neither what McDonnell said nor what JC said to the lords and deputies at a special meeting on Monday night.
Considering that he also touched me, the message discipline continues to hold its importance, from the detail-to-generality that Corbyn is trying to convey, no matter what the illusory image is, in the age of TV 24/7, and especially in the social media vortex, which is the bedrock of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it's reasonable to challenge Europe, which ensures Cameron's support for the Labour Party in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's transition from EU membership to Bennite encirclement economics and anti-capitalist backgrounds is no longer a special debate among left-wing opponents, where minor differences are the cornerstones of narcissism's doctrinal ambivalence.
As with his transition to NATO – Tom Watson is determined that JC will not campaign to leave – foreign diplomats will have to struggle to make a point for their masters in their countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital on concessions to Britain, where they have their own skeptical voters?
As I was told at the opening of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday, the United States is already disappointed by the British’s poor minimum performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the cost-cutting Conservative Party government in power.
Experts criticize UK public health e-cigarette research
In a 12-member meeting with people connected to the tobacco industry, a government-funded agency said e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than cigarettes.
Experts writing in the British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used in the UK Public Health (PHE) report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE published its report last month as a "turning point", which it described as a "detailed examination of the evidence".
But some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed out links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The Lancet medical journal's editorial of last month targeted the "extremely rotten foundation", which is based on the main conclusion of the PHE.
Two other researchers in the BMJ have questioned whether the claims were “founded on sand or rock.”
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of public health is that it is based on evidence of effectiveness of policies."
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking according to the best estimate available" to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this comes from a meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-critical decision analysis (MCDA) model to form a synthesis of their views on the harms associated with various products containing nicotine; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had previously reportedly received funds from British American Tobacco for an independent investigation.
They also said he approved the BAT's public health identification document in a sustainability report.
They added that one in 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funds from a manufacturer of e-cigarettes, but this was not the previously reported funds from the Philip Morris International cigarette company.
It was not disclosed how panel members were selected, but some of these include some known giants of e-cigarettes, some of whom reported the industry fund in the article.
Some of the people present at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco controller at the PHE also attended the meeting.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group's research paper "effectively" acknowledged a lack of "concrete evidence about the harms of most products by many criteria."
But none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said the allegations that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a transition to smoking for children or non-smokers" were too early.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and welfare at PHE, said the allegations at BMJ have been answered before.
He said, “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two smokers dies from this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks caused by e-cigarettes are small compared, but we must continue to examine their long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear mission: to inform the public about what the evidence has shown and what it has not shown, especially at a time when there is a lot of confusion about their harm, especially when compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
We are clearly fulfilling our national responsibility by making it clear that e-cigarettes, although not risk-free, carry only a small fraction of the damage caused by smoking.
Channel 4 chief says BBC should leave EastEnders
Former Channel 4 president Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, and that ad competitors could "give their right hand" for hit shows such as the Albert Square series.
Johnson said the licensing fee should only be used to make such programs that are not made by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public service programs on channels like BBC4, which are likely to be watched by a smaller group of viewers, against their competitors’ highest-rated programs in value-added ranges.
After the BBC’s general director, Tony Hall, said the organization wanted to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson said in his own time on Channel 4 to establish a connection with the BBC that this had been unsuccessful for six years.
Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee during a questioning of the BBC’s future, “I am struggling with the idea that the BBC is ordering and broadcasting programs that can be clearly shown by non-subsidized competitors.”
If you maintain the licensing fee app, which I’m not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, then its output should at least be reduced to programs that others don’t or don’t order.
They're broadcasting The Voice in the primetime range because they want to provide as much support as possible for the future.
The main idea here is based on the idea that no one else can publish it, which is ridiculous and obviously ridiculous.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why programs that can be funded without help should be funded with a decreasing tax rate.
One is The Voice, the other is EastEnders, and it’s actually made in-house.
To be honest, other channels give their right arm for this.
I'm trying to see what public service broadcasts are like.
I don't think that's going to cut the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings "for the ambition of the people who work here and for the way these employees see this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support."
Comments on the BBC’s most popular programs repeat comments from Tony Ball, a former Sky executive who used the MacTaggart class in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer the BBC to sell its programs like EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC’s more affordable public service programs went to BBC4, where viewers could not be measured, but that they covered tax amnesty and could argue to continue their showy religious duties on providing <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion in licensing income, adding: “Of course we’re doing all these dim programs that nobody’s watching.”
They put them in holes that no one will ever see.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I invite you to find a more regressive system in terms of the people who benefit the most from it.
Of course you all think, we all think, 150 pounds a year is a great value, but I wonder why people do it when 150 pounds is a lot of money because they don't watch a lot of the BBC.
David Elstein, a former Sky and Channel 5 executive who also presented evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said some of the BBC’s output is now officially classified as education — which is 1% of the TV output and 0.1% of the radio — and that public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be the forefront of this, and that it should be replaced with “information, lighting and training.”
Regarding partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do something about the Proms shown on TV but only a handful, and collaborate with ad streamers to ensure that all of them are watched online.
'Sonogenetic' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the threadworms change direction as soon as they are hit by sound vibrations.
Scientists have grown maggots with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave bursts.
Tiny threadworms change direction as soon as they are hit by loud vibrations that humans can't hear.
The vibrations are activated by activating the genetically modified motor nerve cells to carry membrane channels that respond to trans-audio waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said maggots have proven the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, so ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an intrusive procedure that gives electrical vibrations into people’s brains to treat Parkinson’s disease symptoms.
Threadworms mostly do not react beyond sound, but Chalasani found that they reacted when they were surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he finds strengthen the ultrasound waves, allowing them to pass through the maggots.
The amplified sound waves affect structures in the membranes of some maggot cells called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are connected to.
In order to create threadworms controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified the worms to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied trans-audio to the altered creatures, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transmitted into the maggots, where they also activated the altered motor neurons.
This procedure has similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to activate and turn off neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that needs to be sent across an optical fiber to the desired point in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue unimpeded and thus be sent through the skull into the brain.
“Using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, we believe that targeted human neurons in the clinical setting for certain neurological treatments can be temporarily made sensitive to the trans-audio signal,” Chalasani said.
He added that other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - right at your doorstep!
Advertisements condemn Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-weapons exhibition video.
Terrible killer drones!
The shackles that ripped your ankles apart!
Fragmented bombs!
And electric shock sticks that cause severe pain but leave no marks!
Fine voice and cartoon footage produced for Amnesty International, designed to highlight the British government’s desire to sell weapons to repressive regimes through the International of Defence and Security Equipment at ExCel Center on London Dock, leaves no doubt that the world’s largest arms fair is a sharp scam.

But a different campaign continues with posters at bus stops and subway trains, requiring a double look.
At one point, using the fonts and brand of the London Underground, he turns the DLR line into a tank and asks, "Important announcement, are you going to travel in the DLR between September 15 and 18?"
This September, a horde of arms dealers will attack the DLR... where customers are asked to help stop this arms show.
The 300 posters are from artists exhibiting works at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Bansky's Dismaland.
A collective called the Private Patrol Group helped distribute it by using "Pulse Packs to Ad Space", which cost <0xC2><0xA3>6 and claimed to have "accessed about a third of the bus stop advertising spaces on the planet."
Transportation for London was not pleased with this banner’s “vandalism.”
One of the ads was created by the Private Patrol group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator of Cruel Designs and Professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more questionable every day and are looking for ways to move political affairs to the masses outside the galleries.
Many artists are working with activists in their protest movements, and they are beginning to realize that for their art to have an impact on society, they need to come out into the real world.
Another anti-weapon trafficking poster stands out to travelers on the subway.
Amnesty International’s video was viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook within 24 hours and was created by the free-run advertising agency VCCP, which also produced the graphic designer and audio artist for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was very surprised by the silence against gun show ads – with free space on the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them a campaign they’re trying to escape.”
They played with the idea of a more realistic, cunning corporate ad, but "they're decorated with bright colors and animation, it's more noticeable."
Tom Davies of Amnesty said: “They have helped us a lot to raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair.”
What we need now is the UK government to act to prevent torture equipment from being sold illegally at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art in the arms fair comes from ExCeL inside, where the exhibitors sell fantastic overlapping products.
In a press release, Saab showed the order of the US military "AT4CS RS launched from our shoulder".
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that strikes the target with a great blow by passing the armor."
Whatever he's doing, it's not gonna be nice.
Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved to student dormitories as a careless 19-year-old and I still believe in bruises and moral relativity, but now I remember the fabled smiles of those I was bothering with — and the countless lengthy complaints about others.
Much of what I've learned can be distilled into eight golden rules.
Moving home can go from frustrating to absolutely terrifying.
The seduction of babbling: where you come from, if you've lost a year, where you insist on Corbyn, and why you don't love or hate Marmite, because really, gentlemen, it's just yeast extract HAHAH I'll be in my room."
Take a breath.
And let others take one too - ask questions and show relevance.
This will guide the conversation, and it will help you separate what you like from people you won’t talk to, even if your eyelashes are burning and they are squeezing out a fire extinguisher.
Leave some space for people.
People’s rooms often turn into drink receptions, movie night venues, and mass hangouts, but these are also places where people dress and arrange their underwear.
Related: Don’t even think about starting college with a relationship
Introverts are treated badly in college.
Your room may be a retreat, but many dormitory corridors develop a culture of hanging out between rooms, and this is open to friendly, social and lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go away for a while so I can put back the energy I spent communicating with you.”
Try to sense that a friend is getting tired of socializing and maybe texting instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A friend in the student dormitory had adopted a policy as if he was invited inside if the door was not locked.
He's seen a lot of things.
Don't make friends by cooking.
Since you’ve started college at the height of the cooking contest madness, it’s less awkward to introduce yourself by ringing people’s doors with a plate of brownies, and less the 1950s will be “Welcome to our neighborhood, I’ve cooked something for you, now I’ll smile while you’re asking personal questions.”
Offering people homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk, and maybe they will associate your face with a sweet surprise.
Frankly, it's about you being a master cook.
Well-mixed lumps of dough, sugar and oil will make people pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
To be honest, catering to someone’s chicken is a theft, but buying a few drops of milk for your tea is stealing?
Check the milk twice.
She'll probably tell you to take care of yourself, even if she's swimming in it.
It's very uncomfortable for someone to steal their stuff, and I understand you -- but try to deal with it in a more mature way than my dorm companion. He put liquid soap in to punish the person who stole his milk.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noise in a way that prevents people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just about being a decent person, but because you're people in glass houses.
A girl in my hallway pressed her neighbor next door and told them to lower the drums a little bit because it's 3 a.m. and she's the morning test.
The answers made the sound even louder.
When they finally closed at 5:00 in the morning, she opened her own music and locked the door with the last sound, gently letting them sleep for two hours before going to her own three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife moved into the same hallway as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be weird if you misunderstood a corridor friend and thought you were your future wife, and you had to hang out and break up and see her every day, and you had to watch your common friends be taken captive?
Of course, that’s the heart, but if your hot aisle neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, at least talk to the little one and advise common sense.
When you realize that in a merry-go-round someone has left their keys inside without locking their door, know that the line between joking and persecuting someone is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it will take time to come back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun lesson about safety by hiding their belongings – but never pollute someone’s room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in a glass of water in the freezer, but don’t stick your stuff to the ceiling more than twice.

Her heart stopped when she became beautiful.
Raquel Santos (28), a mother of two children living in RIO DA JANEIRO, consulted her aesthetic doctor last Monday to remove traces of laughter from her mouth.
After a while, the woman who was injected with filler in her face accelerated her heartbeat and breathing.
After that, his heart stopped beating and he died.
Police are investigating whether the drug "Potenay", which she uses on a daily basis, played a role in her death.
The real cause of death will be determined after the autopsy.
Debora Azevedo, one of the model’s closest friends, told the Brazilian press that Santos, a seven-year-old and a 13-year-old boy, was obsessed with plastic surgery.
Santos, who took part in one of Brazil's most important beauty contests in December, was second.
Oil companies have officially collapsed.
In 2014, when oil prices began to fall, nearly $400 billion in investments were delayed until the end of last year, with most deepwater oil exploration projects suspended.
According to a study by consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices have led to the suspension of $380 billion in oil and gas exploration/production, while production of millions of barrels from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa has also been delayed.
The biggest reason for the cost cuts is that in the summer of 2014, at $115, oil prices fell by 70 percent in 1.5 years, to the lowest level in 12 years, the report says, "Company budgets have drastically narrowed."
400 BILLION DOLLARS IN ASSHOLE
While crude oil prices bring new surprises every day, they last fell below $30, the lowest in 12 years.
"Oil drops to $15"; "Is oil now cheaper than water" debates on energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie's research today reveals how the industry is affected by falling prices.
Finally, in a July report, Wood Mackenzie revealed that falling oil prices led to the suspension of $200 billion in 46 major energy investments, and his new study reveals where this figure has reached by the end of 2015.
In the last six months of 2015, 22 major projects have been postponed, while 68 major projects have been suspended since the oil collapse began in 2014.
The value of these projects is about $400 billion.
2.9 MILLION DAILY
Highlighting the impact of low oil prices on company plans, the study notes that the most affected projects are deep-sea development projects.
Suspended projects account for a total reserve of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent, with daily production of 2.9 million barrels of oil being postponed until 2025.
According to the study, the final investment decision of most of these projects was postponed to 2017 and beyond, with initial production targets shifting between 2020 and 2023.
Among the 68 deferred projects, the report highlights the potential investment of $170 billion, which is projected to be made over the next five years, "most of the $170 billion is deep-sea projects."
This is because the cost of pre-investment is too high.
"70% of deep sea expenditures are primarily oil-based projects in Nigeria, Angola and the Gulf of Mexico."
According to the study, the countries with the most deferred oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 percent of the deferred liquid (oil) reserves.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, the countries with the largest deferred gas reserves, account for 85 percent of the total.
While most of the natural gas waiting to come out here is in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions such as building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant from scratch.
The most endangered companies are oil giants with successive commitments in the deep sea, Canadian oil sand and the Caspian region, while the companies are trying to adapt to the "longer lower" oil prices scenario.
Eyes in Iran
About four years ago, the United States and Europe had imposed an embargo on Iranian oil to stop Tehran’s nuclear program, the price of oil was about $110 a barrel, and it was debated how Iranian oil exports would shrink without causing a sudden price jump.
When we come back this week, we see a different scenario.
Oil prices fell below $30 for the first time since 2004, mainly because of the U.S. manufacturing boom, and the embargo against Iran has been lifted.
His eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases its oil exports, even more oil will flow into the oil market, which is already quite saturated.
This could lead to prices falling below the levels that surprised us today.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, which does not want to lose market share to Iran, will pump even more oil, and there may be a price war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
As soon as the sanctions are lifted, Iran’s main target is its former partners in Asia’s fast-growing oil market, India and Europe.
Earlier, Iranian officials said they were aiming to increase exports by 500,000 barrels per day in the first place and to bring that amount to the market after a while.
According to Reuters map information, while 22 very large crude oil carriers (VLCCs) are waiting outside Iran, at least 13 of them are fully or in large quantities.
Iran has the world’s fourth-largest proven oil reserves.
Thanks to the sanctions, Iran still exports about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Before the sanctions, Iran’s daily oil exports were up to 3 million barrels per day.
Support Securities Research Specialist Aysun Göksu answers the question of whether oil will fall below $20: "China-based global growth concerns increase the downward pressure on commodity prices, while deepening the loss in oil prices."
In China, the world’s largest oil importer, we see losses of oil have reached 20 percent since the beginning of the year, with concerns that oil demand will decrease in parallel with economic slowdown.
In addition, due to the global value gain of the dollar and the global supply surplus problem, we may witness prices below $30 in oil in the coming days.
As long as we don’t see lasting pricing on the $32-33 levels, the upward movement in oil may be limited and the downward pressure may increase.
At this point, it can be said that closings below the critical $30 level play a key role in keeping the declines going.
In such a situation, it should come as no surprise that there are relaxations on the lower side that last up to 23.30-25.60 support zones.
Isham Sardouk: “The angel era is over!”
Why did you turn the route to Turkey when you took the role of trend creative at Victoria’s Secret and WGSN, which determines the fashion trends of the world?
- I'm always in favor of change.
I was born in Paris, lived in London, then went to New York.
I also took important positions there.
In the meantime, I've been advising Koton for the past two years.
And then I saw the potential in this geography and the Koton brand.
I realized that there was everything necessary to be a chain of stores in the world age.
Now I'm here to make that happen.
Will you be able to do it soon?
- Absolutely.
Even though it is a young brand, it is already sold in 50 countries.
We produce 50 collections a year, 15 separate chapters.
So there’s everything a chain of stores has to have.
From Dubai to Moscow, we are able to meet the needs of consumers from different geographies.
Now we are opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era.
Do you need to open a store in Paris?
- Yeah. - Yeah.
It’s not because Europe’s economic situation is great.
But you open some stores for image.
In fashion capitals like Paris, London, you have a shop, you make money in the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, the other adds money, both of which are essential for a brand that plays globally.
Let’s talk about trends...
We have a very romantic, chic season ahead of us.
Floating chiffon dresses, soft tones, pinks, whites, reds.
Patterns...
We are going through very difficult and ruthless times, and the fashion world always tries to bring a little bit of happiness to life by carrying elegant, heartwarming designs to the podium during these difficult times.
That's what we do.
That's why the "era of elegance" is coming back in the new season.
Let's go back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel? - Karolina Kurkova.
I’m not just talking about her great physique: she’s so positive, she’s so good!
He would sit next to me while I was working and feed me apples and stuff like, "Honey, are you hungry?"
I mean, he was so cute.
You know what I'm talking about, and you interviewed all Victoria's Secret models.
Caroline was beautiful, wasn't she?
But Adriana Lima was also very impressed with her beauty.
- Say yes, that voice!
That speech, that tone...
Then, after a while, he gets nervous and says, “Sit down and look good, and don’t do anything else.”
It's nerve-wracking.
That's right, there's shocks like that.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, but I was horrified by her stupidity.
- Most of them are.
The angels are not the same as before.
I remember Gisele's time...
It was hard to work with him, though.
He came to the backyard and smoked like a chimney.
It's not that he's a drug addict.
No one can drink, that's the only thing they can drink.
Let's make a 'diva'.
The Victoria's Secret show, which was released two months ago, received the lowest rating in its history.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, it's over, the time of the legendary angels.
Excuse me, but who needs Gigi Hadid?
What's so good about it?
Kendall Jenner, like a wooden...
There's no fold, nothing.
Kate Moss has zero curves, but has become the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but what a beautiful face.
I want to exercise my right to object here.
I interviewed him last year, and his face was pretty...
- All that smoking and drinking, now it's ugly.
But in the nineties, she had such a beautiful face.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
He had reached the end of his supermodel era.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington.
Christy was my neighbor, and I saw her every morning without makeup.
Such a pure beauty cannot be such an elegance.
What about Cara Delevingne?
- He's wasting himself.
It is not included in every campaign.
People get tired.
There is no hunger for celebrities and celebrities like before.
People want to see real faces like themselves in campaigns.
We're going to go after it.
Because that's the trend.
25 Letters from Turkish Authors
Authors, including the presidents of the International Union of Writers (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, noted that threats and physical attacks targeting colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life.
The letter included two attacks targeting Hürriyet newspaper in Turkey, the Koza group raid and the arrest of Vice News reporters, as well as investigations and arrests against journalists.
Mother's Right to Half-Work Debate
"We believe that mothers are given half the right to work in order to bring back the rental labor."
"This may be a trojan horse," said T<0xC4><0xB0>SK, "and we are concerned that this arrangement, which will be in favor of women, will prevent women from working."
The new rights, which were planned to be introduced to civil servants and working women after childbirth or adoption, passed through the commission with all-day negotiations.
After childbirth, the most common issue in the commission talks was "leasing work" of the regulations, which provided the possibility of part-time work for 6 months or free leave until the child reaches the elementary school age.
It is true that it is right to have partial work until the child goes to primary school, but there are some concerns that CHP <0xC4><0xB0>zmir MP Musa <0xC3><0x87>am said, "If you bring the rental labor arrangement after this, we will be against it until the end."
Enis Bagdadio<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who participated in the commission talks on behalf of Turk-<0xC4><0xB0><0xC5><0x9F>, expressed similar concerns and said, "We have doubts about how to replace the female employee in half-time work."
Bagdadio<0xC4><0x9F>lu stated that new problems will arise that will surpass subcontractor work if hired work is brought up again on this occasion, "We will therefore monitor developments related to private employment bureaus with concern," he said.
T<0xC4><0xB0>SK Secretary-General Bülent Pirler said that the law introduced a five-year period of partial work, adding, "There is no such long-term partial work in other countries."
And look at it this way.
"In places with 1 or 2 employees, it is also necessary to consider the consequences of this practice," he said.
TOBB Consultant Ahmet <0xC5><0x9E>agar also said that if the practice goes to life, there will be difficulties in finding workers.
Saying that there is no legislation regarding the rules to be applied in part-time work, <0xC5><0x9E>a<0xC4><0x9F>ar said, "An agreement should be reached between the worker and the employer to whom the regulations regarding private employment offices come out."
Metin Feyzio<0xC4><0x9F>lu: We do not support
Feyzio<0xC4><0x9F>lu’s statement reads: “We do not agree with this declaration, it is impossible for us to participate and support it.”
There is no word of criticism from the PKK.
You could not say anything negative to the PKK, to the separatist terrorist organization, and you did not put dust on it.
We do not take the heavy statements made against the state seriously, and we do not find them sincere, taking into account the people who use them.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
If the representatives of the state, public officials, and security forces have any illegal behavior within this framework, let us follow it.
When we say to the remnants of the armistice that look sympathetically at the divisors or the divisors, “Don’t destroy the state,” they attack us as “Separatists, fascists.”
When we say, "This is the law," we say, "This is the law," and we say, "This is the law."
We're the bridge.
We are always responsible for telling the truth.

Who's the Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name is Belgin Sarl<0xC4><0xB1>ker, was born on 16 July 1960 in Mersin.
With the divorce of her parents, she moved to Ankara with her mother Sebahat <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>r in 1966.
After Yenimahalle Yunus Emre Primary School, he entered the Piano section of Ankara State Conservatory, but due to financial difficulties, he left and worked at the PTT for a while, increasing his age.
In 1979, after performing at the Feyman Night Club, where he went to have fun with his friends, he accepted an offer to work.
At Feyman Night Club, together with the Group Lokomotiv orchestra, he performed with repertoires consisting of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and modern-day arcs.
After Ankara, Bergen went to Adana for work, where she met Halis Serbes and married a year later.
In 1982, he released his first longplay from Atlas Records, "I Have a Complaint".
As her artistic life continued, Bergen, unable to withstand her husband’s violence, ran away from her many times.
In October 1982, while working in <0xC4><0xB0>zmir, she was insulted by her husband's insistence.
In this attack, Bergen, which lost one eye and burned a large part of the body, was convinced by Cengiz <0xC3><0x96>zseker, the composer of the song "Who knows?", which became famous for Kibariye after the treatment.
Until 1985, the artist, who performed at <0xC3><0x96>zseker's <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Diamond Pavilion, together with his boss, prepared a demo cassette called "Brother Fate" and sent it to Ya<0xC5><0x9F>ar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist, who produced his first professional longplay in the Istanbul music market, "Human Lover" under Burhan Bayar's music directorship, became famous for his "Woman of Pain" in late 1986.
In April 1987, she was awarded the Golden Plate and Golden Tape by the record company with the title of "Best Selling 1986 Album Arabesque Female Artist".
In the same year, with <0xC3><0x9C>lkü Erakal<0xC4><0xB1>n's screenplay and directing "The Woman of Pain", Yalç<0xC4><0xB1>n Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron were in front of the camera.
Bergen, which gained a large fan base, survived the knife attack in Adana where she went to the concert at the last moment.
The artist, who also left the stage for a time, released the albums "Yak Allah", "The price of my love" and "I don't want" respectively under the direction of the great masters Salami <0xC5><0x9E>ahin, <0xC3><0x96>zer <0xC5><0x9E>enay and Cengiz Tekin.
After her husband's divorce in April 1989, Bergen returned to the stage in June 1989 with her last album, "Years Without Forgiveness".
The artist, who started the promotional tours of the album, which was met with intense interest, was shot and killed by his wife on the night of August 14, 1989, in Adana Pozant<0xC4><0xB1>.
His homeland was buried in Mersin.
In his 29-year short life, Bergen made 5 longplays and 129 songs on 11 tapes and a video film.
The claims that the artist who signed the arabeske with his distinctive and powerful voice became legendary were confirmed by the fact that the album "My Youth of Gone", which was released after his death, was exhausted from the first day.
Bergen's official studio albums:
1982 – I Have a Complaint LP (reprinted as MC in 1986).
1983 – Brotherhood Fate LP (reprinted as MC in 1985 and 1990)
1985 – Human Loves LP, MC (reprinted as a CD in 1999)
1986 – The Woman of Pain LP, MC (reprinted as a CD in 1999)

1990 – My Outgoing Youth MC (reprinted as a CD in 1999)
1990 – Stranger's <0xC3><0x87>iles<0xC4><0xB1>r<0xC4><0xB1>n MC (reprinted as a CD in 1999)

Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet commemorated on his 114th birthday
Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet Ran, known as the Country Poet, was commemorated in the 114th year of his birth with the event "Good luck Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m".
The event organized by Konak Municipality took place in the hall where the name of the poet was given in the Güzelyal<0xC4><0xB1> Cultural Center.
With the event, poetry and music were listened to and the poems of the famous poet were voiced by the theater and film actor Ru<0xC5><0x9F>tu Asian.
In addition, the event was accompanied by the Three Anatolian Music Communities with their comments.
His wisdom was accompanied by many works of art.
These names included Ali Selekkiner Receiver, Erkoç Torun, Nedim Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z, Zeynep Göknur Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z and Ziya <0xC3><0x96>zsekmen.
In Istanbul, the event organized by the Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet Foundation for Culture and Arts was held.
Foundation President Rutkay Aziz and members, daughter, son-in-law and grandson of Nâz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet's wife Vera Tulyakova, met in Tarabya for the event, actor Tar<0xC4><0xB1>k Akan.
He will read poems and throw cloves into the sea with the slogan, "Living is like a tree and free / And like a forest, brotherly."
The event organized with the contributions of Sar<0xC4><0xB1>yer Municipality will be accompanied by songs of Nâz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet Choir.
Nazim Hikmet was born on January 15, 1902.
The poems of the world famous poet Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He was arrested several times for his political views and spent most of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poems have been translated into more than fifty languages and his works have received many awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
Bursa Nilüfer Municipality made special works on the 114th birthday of the world famous poet Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet.
The municipality, which works for the documentary "Nazimi of Bursa", which tells about Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m's 11-year-old days in Bursa Prison, also issued personal stamps for the poet for the first time in the history of Turkey.
Thus, in cooperation with the PTT, the first personal stamp in the history of Turkey was issued in the name of Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet.
These special stamps and first day envelopes, which are priced at 1.40 TL, will be presented to the guests on the night of Thursday, January 14, at Naz<0xC4><0xB1>m Hikmet Kültürevi.
They will be deported by bicycle.
However, due to the lack of agreement between the two countries, refugees, most of whom are Syrians, will have to return to Russia by pedalling at minus 20 degrees Celsius this time.
During the summer months, a group of refugees flew to Russia from Murmansk to Norway because it was safer and cheaper.
Because the agreement between the two countries did not allow them to cross the border on foot, migrants crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
The Norwegian authorities have ordered the repair of abandoned bicycles after crossing the border.
Turkey's <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion crisis
Turkey is facing a crisis of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion committed to refugees.
European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker has criticized Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for blocking funds to be transferred to Turkey.
The mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good, Juncker said, underlining that the EU has to find <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
"This money is not for Turkey, it is for Syrian refugees in Turkey," Juncker said.
We haven't reached 3 billion yet.
"This is a matter of EU credibility, so it's important," he said.
Juncker said he expects the money to be completed by January 26, the date previously given.
Italy is among the countries with a positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources say Rome's stance on the financial package is not a direct move towards Turkey and is linked to problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some EU countries.
Tensions between Italy and the EU have been on the rise for some time.
At the last EU summit on energy, banking and migrants, Renzi continued to criticize German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU harshly.
Juncker, who criticized Renzi's stance at a press conference yesterday, said, "Renzi should stop blaming the EU."
"It is wrong for Renzi, who I love so much, to insult the EU Commission at every opportunity," he said.
Juncker hinted that Renzi was playing for the internal public.
Of the 3 billion euros promised to Turkey, 1 billion will be covered by the EU budget.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion will come from the budgets of the member states.
Germany will contribute at least 427 million euros.
The Greek government, which said it would not transfer money to Turkey for political reasons, has agreed to transfer its share of 2.3 million euros to the EU budget to be used to support Jordan and Lebanon.
The resource is expected to be used in 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw the Charlie Hebdo cartoon.
Speaking to the Russian news agency Sputnik, father Abdullah Kurdi reacted harshly and said, "I cried for this cartoon if you want to be honest."
He said, "I felt really bad."
The father Kurdi said he expected positive things from the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which became a symbol of freedom of expression after the shooting, said:
They made a bad caricature.
Everyone was saddened by this cartoon.
Aylan is a 2-year-old boy and is dead.
Charlie Hebdo was supposed to respect Aylan, me and my family, but it was the opposite.
This magazine should show respect for the dead.
They published a disrespectful cartoon about our Prophet.
They have published a book about God.
It is a small thing that is done to my child in the sight of Allah and His Messenger.
Kurdi, who lives in Erbil, made the following call: "My call to the whole world and to the humor magazine, everyone should respect all children who die."
They shouldn't hurt their families, they shouldn't add pain to their suffering.
Aylan Kurdi’s aunt Tima Kurdi, who lives in Canada, was also one of those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau, a 3-year-old Syrian who threw his dead body on the shore of Bodrum, has the impression that he could be one of the abusers in Germany when he grows up.
Last year, the French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo, who was attacked by radical religious groups for publishing cartoons, became the focus of controversy again because of his cartoon about Aylan Kurdi.
The caricature depicts the female abusers in Cologne, Germany, as well as the pig-faced and migrants who chase women, as did the female abusers during New Year's celebrations.
The cartoon, which causes different reactions on social media, is actually part of a 4-frame column.
The column reads, "This is not France," and many readers criticize the growing hostility to refugees, along with other values lost to France.
The cartoon, on the other hand, has led many to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
Last year, the magazine Charlie Hebdo praised Germany for accepting 800,000 refugees, criticizing France’s reluctance to open its doors to migrants.
The caricature says that he was “very close to his purpose,” while the ad poster reads “Two children’s menus for one price.”
Autopsy of Germans killed in Sultanahmet in Germany
According to the weekly magazine Der Spiegel, the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office has decided to bring the bodies of 10 people killed in the attack to Germany.
The funerals of the dead will be held today or tomorrow at the airport by a German Air Force aircraft.
In Germany, experts from the Identification Commission of the Federal Criminal Agency (BKA), which conducts forensic trials, normally go to countries where the incident occurred for German citizens who died in accidents or attacks, where they perform identification and autopsy.
However, Der Spiegel magazine said the situation would be different this time.
According to the magazine, officials from the Federal Criminal Agency applied to Turkish authorities for identification and autopsy of the dead in Istanbul, but Turkish officials did not accept the proposal.
The Federal Criminal Department sent four specialists to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are undergoing treatment at the hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has died.
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theorist and socialist historian, was particularly remembered for his important work on the origins of capitalism.
Meiksins Wood of Latvian origin, born in New York in 1942, also published in Turkish: Escape from Class -- The Archaic Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- The Origin of Capitalism -- Capitalism -- Return to Marx
Swimming pool ban for asylum seekers
The German press reports that the municipality will lift the ban if social workers in the country are informed that the message of the ban has been understood by the asylum seekers.
In a statement to the WDR, Markus Schnapka, a social office official, said the municipality does not want to punish the innocent for the actions of a few people, and that they have informed residents in the dormitories in three languages about the values of importance in Germany.
Schnapka noted that they are debating the value of gender equality that Germany attaches to, adding that the municipality will punish any attacks and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival at Rheinberg has been cancelled due to the possibility of the upcoming carnival parades in Cologne.
The municipality announced the cancellation of the carnival pass because there was no guarantee that the abuses would not happen.
What are the benefits of cooking on steam?
The technique of steam cooking, a technique that does not kill vitamins and minerals in food, is becoming increasingly popular.
Steaming, one of the most preferred cooking techniques in the Far East for centuries, makes metabolism strong and facilitates digestion.
With this method, which completely eliminates problems such as indigestion, the bacteria and microbes found in the food also die completely.
Substances such as protein, cellulose and starch in the food melt completely with this technique, making the food softer.
Steam cooking at low pressure is carried out in the pot with the help of steam containers or steam machine.
When cooking at high pressure, the amount of water used and cooking time is low.
One of the best examples of this is cooking in a pressure cooker.
In order to cook foods such as vegetables, especially in dietary menus, it is necessary to wash the vegetables thoroughly first and then put them in the strainer and wait for them to glide well.
A deep pot is filled with a third of water and the steam strainer is placed inside the pot.
The mouth of the pot is left half-closed.
This ensures that the steam can easily come out of the pot.
The boiler fire is first brought to the highest level and the water boils, then the boiler fire is brought to a lower level and a constant heat is obtained.
Vegetables and nutrients cooked in the steam for about 10-15 minutes are checked with the help of forks after thoroughly cooking.
Vegetables that are cooked are taken from the stove and placed in plates and served.
In the technique of steam cooking, the appearance, color and smell of the food do not change, so this method is healthy.
The taste of the food remains the same.
Thus, the quality and taste of the food remain intact.
In steam cooking, which is also one of the most economical methods of cooking, the loss of nutrients is also kept to a minimum.
Steamed vegetables offer a satisfying feast to those who eat with their more lively and vibrant appearance.
This method, which is often used in diet meals, is also often preferred because it is light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: Alien's "last" album
To know that you're going to die, to make that last album without telling anyone, to make your death bed an artistic expression in the clip you're shooting...
Things like this may seem too “on the edge” for us earthly mortals.
I say earthly mortals because I am among those who sincerely believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He had come to our Earth from another corner of the universe; now he has returned to his homeland; that is what happened.
He came because there was an inspiration to be given not only to Kiss, Marilyn Manson, or Lady Gaga, but to all the artists of the world.
He fulfilled his duty well.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: 9.99 <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 5/5
He probably fed from Warhol, Kubrick, who was from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the moon, he decided to say, "Is that something I'm an alien?" and he got confused, singing "Space Oddity."
Actually, he didn't get involved; he always went a few steps ahead.
Many have found their way through it.
Musician and listener...
If we put aside his interest in plastic arts, his acting and all that, it would be unfair to say "It was just music" for his music.
The characters that go from song to song and create themselves; their references, innovation, taboo, and discography express an artistic integrity to me.
I can't call him the ancestor of glam rock, nor the cousin of punk.
What about those avant-garde electronic movements, the jazz he's been hiding as love ever since he was a kid?
David Bowie has been reminding us of what the word means all these years when we chewed up the word "icon."
It wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman, it wasn't a man.
It was a body.
He appeared to us for a while on a mission.
He left the world two days after the release of his 26th studio album "Blackstar".
Before the album was released, he tried to get us to go with "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" that we listened to.
We thought, "He's getting old, he's talking about death or something," and he knew it all.
One last game...
Apart from the great "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", which bears the message and the emotional burden of the album, the number of songs we know together with "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)" and "'This A Pity She Was A Whore", which was re-released a long time ago.
The rest of you, "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are all very good songs.
"Blackstar" is built on a very powerful musical structure, but it's also made with a lot of sincerity, instantaneous sensations...
Not death, not a "compromise with the past" album.
It's just a real "last" album.
"The End" of a musical life that is a masterpiece from beginning to end.
Turkey targeted in Sultanahmet attack
Holger Münch, head of the German Federal Security Service, said in a program on German first channel ARD that the attack on Sultanahmet Square on Tuesday killed 10 German citizens.
Münch said the target of the attack was Turkey, not German citizens.
“I have 400 people under my watch.
However, Münch said the Sultanahmet attack did not change the threat of terrorism in Germany, adding: “We are still under a threat that needs to be taken seriously.”
Münch said there was a decrease in the number of people from Germany who went to Syria to join ISIS, while a large number of people returned from war zones.
"There are almost 400 dangerous people that we should not keep in custody at the moment," Münch said.
Münch called for better coordination and closer communication between police agencies in Europe.
Turkish officials said the suicide bomber was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the attacker had not yet been identified.
Sezen Aksu Says Goodbye to Scenes
Sezen Aksu, who has decorated his 40th year with a concert series, captivated his fans with his "Years with Sezen" concert last night at Volkswagen Arena.
The last ring of the concert series, which was held in July, took place at Volkswagen Arena on January 15-16.
Aksu took all his listeners on a 40-year journey from yesterday to today.
In addition to the love songs that touched our personal lives, Aksu sang his songs on social issues that are closely related to our country and the world.
After performing the concerts promised, Aksu, who said he would say goodbye to stage life, upset his fans.
Sezen Aksu appeared with a separate story in each piece in front of the fans who filled the Volkswagen Arena in the "Senior Years" concert.
Each story, show, light and stage show took the audience to different eras.
In the last part of the unforgettable concert, a video showing the Istanbul paintings of Revolution Erbil was also shown.
Aksu also made his first appearance on the scene by introducing his fans to the previously recorded videos.
25 cents for bread raised in Ankara and Istanbul
In Ankara, as of yesterday, 250 grams of bread increased by 25 cents and began to be sold for 1 TL.
Before the new year, especially in December, the Minister of Food, Agriculture and Livestock Faruk <0xC3><0x87>elik and the Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci made statements in the form of "No Zam".
However, in the capital, Ankara, 250 grams of bread were sold yesterday for 1 TL.
Halil <0xC4><0xB0>brahim Balc<0xC4><0xB1>, President of Turkey Bakery Federation, regarding the 25-cent increase in bread, said: "The increase was not made, the tariff decision from 2 years ago has begun to be implemented" and added:
"It was a tariff decision taken two years ago."
The Chamber of Commerce established this tariff two years ago.
A price applied throughout Turkey.
This means that a new price increase has not been achieved.
But because of competition, in some areas in Ankara, the tradesmen sold for 75 cents.
In some areas, it was already sold for <0xC2><0xA3>1.
The trader who relied on his machine and bread did not lower the price. Because of the competition, they now have to apply 1 TL.
There is no increase or increase.
They're applying the unsecured price.
“In the first half of 2016, the kilogram price of bread will definitely not exceed 5 TL and if we do not experience a lot of trouble, we will complete the year with this price.”
In some parts of Istanbul, bread began to be sold for 1.25 TL.
This time it was Burkina Faso.
The attack, which targeted a luxury hotel in Burkina Faso, West African country, which is known to be favored by foreigners and UN officials, killed 23 people from 18 different countries.
Al Qaeda's North African branch claimed responsibility for the attack.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after ISIS carried out a terrorist attack in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim country, with a population of 250 million.
In a daylight bombing and shooting at a Starbucks branch and police station on a busy street with foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops, one Canadian and one Indonesian lost their lives.
Indonesian officials said the attackers were inspired by the Paris massacre on November 13.
British BBC television security correspondent Frank Garner said the move was part of a frightening trend that has recently manifested itself in many cities around the world.
The U.S. was recently injured in the terrorist attacks.
At the beginning of December, 14 people were killed in a shooting in San Bernardino, California, U.S.A. in an ISIS-sympathetic couple.
The 'San Bernardino' attack on the United States
Following the suicide bombing in Sultanahmet, which killed 10 German tourists, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere recalled that there were terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, “We experienced two major attacks in Paris.”
If we say so, then terror will win.
We used the phrase "without stepping back."
ISIS Leaves Whatsapp Talking with Alrawi App
According to a new report, the terrorist organization is using its own chat tool to communicate independently of chat apps such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to Defense One’s report, the organization is using a new messaging app to send messages between itself.
This Android app, called "Alrawi", is distributed and installed through an APK file.
The app allows the organization to message and share media between itself encrypted.
Flash moves from ISIS in Iraq
The functionality of the app remains “primitive” against popular apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to Ghost Security Group.
How powerful the encryption used is is not known at this time.
ISIS had previously carried out all of its communications through the Telegram application, which allowed to send messages via encrypted connection.
Telegram, however, revealed the channels that ISIS members were talking about.
What’s more, the U.S. administration is demanding that app developers place backdoors on their apps.
This is why the organization has now started using its own solutions instead of relying on WhatsApp and Telegram encryption.
UAE: Iran agrees to nuclear deal
Speaking at a press conference in Vienna, Kerry said Iran has fulfilled its obligations under the nuclear deal and the United States has officially lifted economic sanctions on Iran: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has announced that Iran has fulfilled the necessary commitments under the nuclear deal.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted congratulations on the lifting of sanctions following the nuclear deal signed between six world powers and Tehran.

How should the Semester Vacation be evaluated?
We asked Murat Ayd<0xC4><0xB1>n, an education expert-student coach, how should students evaluate their semester vacation.
Semester holidays should not be thought of as just rest, entertainment, spending time in front of television and computers.
Semester holidays are a very important opportunity to prepare for the new educational period and review the past.
The so-called leisure vacation is also an important opportunity for personal development, knowledge, skills and hobbies.
Make a semi-annual assessment list.
Write down everything you plan to do and try to implement it.
Make sure you enjoy it and you will have a very productive semester.
Now let’s talk about what a productive semester period should be for students who are preparing for YGS-LYS in the first place.
Because the questions that come to us most often from friends preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are: "How should we evaluate this period, should we solve a lot of questions, or should we solve the missing issues?"
In order to answer both these questions and to have a productive period, let us first begin with the advice of friends who prepare for the exam.
While the exam preparation process should be a process that normally starts from the 9th grade, we are trying to complete it more often in the last 1 year, which for us requires us to spend the last year more efficiently, efficiently, and using the time more accurately.
In addition to exam preparation, the senior student must also carry out the school’s written work together.
Although the graduate student who has completed the school has taken and experienced the exam (YGS-LYS) at least once, the year in which he will prepare for the exam as a graduate student is critical for him as well.
Because most graduate students and their parents see the "O" year as their last chance, which creates even greater stress.
Studying is the work that the student does not enjoy, only because he feels obligated, and therefore he usually leaves it at the end, but for the students who do it regularly, who make it a habit, it has become a task and what to do is always within a plan.
Now we have a semester break ahead of us, and we need to make the most of it.
We need to have a plan that will allow us to manage our time well.
Studying on a Semi-Year Vacation:
Everyone should have a plan that fits their situation first.
What was taken care of, what was lacking, should plan the day, the week, and the 15-day time.
During this period, there must be both repetitions of the subject and questions solutions.
At the same time, students who do not lack too much can solve an average of 1-2 trial exams.
Research shows that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetting is to do it over and over again.
Students who make a lot of mistakes from past subjects in particular should focus on their general re-work.
Find out what you are missing and plan for the day, place the topics on each day, and make sure that they are addressed.
This planning will comfort you both academically and psychologically.
Make sure that when you put things in your plan, they are the ones you make the most mistakes.
Because you won’t have such a long vacation in the future.
Make Question Solutions:
It’s just as important to solve problems as to repeat them.
Because we can see how much we understand the work we do only through the feedback we receive through the question we solve.
Don’t forget to set a certain number of questions every day.
The number of questions you will solve may vary according to the work you will do on that day; you may not be able to solve a lot of questions in a day when you work on the subject, but we still need to do a certain amount of question solving in order to see how much we have learned about the topic that day.
Solve the Trial Exams:
Another study you will do on a half-year vacation should be to solve trial exams.
Although not all subjects are finished, you can at least make the lesson trial test solutions.
Let’s say that you have done a great deal of the Turkish lesson; you can solve 40 questions prepared Turkish lesson experiments.
And do it while you are doing it.
If you can solve 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes at first, your next goal should be to solve them in a few minutes less if possible.
Vacation and Hobby Plan:
Of course, a vacation doesn’t just mean studying; you should also set aside a few days for your vacation, rest and hobbies.
A holiday period that will only be spent studying will prevent you from being discharged and resting.
Therefore, there should also be special times in your plans that you have to devote to yourself.
Reading books, watching TV, surfing the Internet can be part of your plans, and most importantly, how much time you will spend.
I have a little advice for those of you who haven’t had a good first year.
If my first semester didn’t go very well, I didn’t work hard and you say that I have a lot of shortcomings, this semester vacation is a great opportunity for you too.
But first you have to decide and believe it.
In the 2009–10 Turkish Super League, the most goals were scored between the 76th and 90th minutes.
Now answer the question you asked yourself, is the game over and you are going to the dressing room, or is the game still going on and there are so many minutes left to score?
I don't think anyone would want to say "we're going to look at the next game", which is a lost football team coach or a classic comment by his players.
All you have to do now is leave the past behind and look ahead, not walk, but run.
To summarize what we say:
1) Make a semester vacation plan in the first place,
2) Do it again by going over the things you know.
3) Resolve your missing issues.
4) Solve the issue by consolidating the issue,
5) Solve trial tests,
6) Read the book,
Set new goals for the new period.
Take time for yourself, your hobbies, and the things you enjoy.
9) Spend time with your family and friends,
10) Spend time on social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theater, concerts, excursions, picnics, etc.)
The Caravan has come a long way.
<0xC5><0x9E>inasi Demirel and his son Hasan, the founder of Karvan, one of the largest ‘home’ store chains in Turkey with 45 stores with an average of 1,000 square meters each, have added Home Sweet Home to the membership of Karvan, which has 17 stores abroad and 25 stores in the country.
With the operation, which was recently completed in the trade registration process, Karvan also became the owner of 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
<0xC5><0x9E>inasi Demirel stated that there is currently no Caravan store abroad, "Now we will continue the large store with Caravan and smaller store with Home Sweet Home."
He added: “The country will also be open to the outside world.
With the merger of Home Sweet Home with a turnover of 50 million liras and Caravan with a turnover of 90 million liras, a retail chain with a turnover of 140 million liras emerged.
Caravan, which has 45 mosques in 35 provinces, has a total sales area of 45 thousand square meters.
25 of the stores are owned by the parent company.
There are about 500 people employed in the caravan.
Home Sweet Home has 25 stores abroad and has a total sales area of 6,500 square meters and employs 320 people.
Home Sweet Home Chairman Kadir Kalayc<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who works in production, export and merchandising with his partner Alev Pakten, stated that they are very pleased with the merger with Karvan and said, "We are Mardinlily and entered this sector in 1998."
From the beginning, we would have come up with a brand with the support of <0xC5><0x9E>inasi Beys.
Mr. Shinasi is the TRT of this sector.
We learned a lot from him, too.
We even started our first step to the store when he gave us his own White Center store.
We were already working with the caravan as a strategic partner, not as a competitor.
“Now with this merger, there will be a very serious synergy,” he said.
Kalayc<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu announced that Home Sweet Home currently has 17 stores abroad, the weight of which is in the Middle East, and started exports to China last month.
“We also opened our first corner in Shanghai.
We have a chain with 200 stores.
“From now on, we will develop the large store abroad as Caravan and the small store with Home Sweet Home,” he said.
Poroshenko sells factory in Russia
Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, in an interview with the Liga.net news site, said that the factory is on sale for $200 million.
Moskalevsky: "Yes, we put the factory on sale."
"As soon as I put it on sale, all the real buyers disappeared," he said, noting that there was no buyer.
Regarding the price of the company's factory in Lipetsk, Russia, Moskalevsky said, "We set it at about $200 million."
Roshen, which produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and confectionery per year, is one of the largest producers in the world and belongs to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding was a PLADIS Abroad
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding has merged global companies operating in the cookies and chocolate sectors it has purchased under the name "Pladis".
With the merger of De Met’s, Godiva, United Biscuits and <0xC3><0x9C>lker brands, a new $5.2 billion food giant with 26,000 employees was born.
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding Chairman of Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding Murat <0xC3><0x9C>lker, who spoke at the meeting on the unification of global companies, said, "Being a global company has been our goal since the beginning" and added:
Murat <0xC3><0x9C>lker, 335 million liras sold live from Periscope
Founded 72 years ago, it is now Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding, a global brand and global company in the chocolate confectionery business.
During this time, we have developed from retail to packaging as well as biscuit chocolate candy, from real estate to personal care and in various industries.
We are at thousands of sales points with 77 factories, 300 brands operating in 14 countries.
All Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding said that "more than 50 thousand people are a family" <0xC3><0x9C>lker said, "Now that we look at the opportunities in our family, we want to go back and focus on our main business, the biscuit chocolate candy, and be global in this field; for this we are re-organizing and explaining the new structure as follows:
<0xC3><0x9C>lker's father Sabri Bey's life story
We re-evaluate our company structure, we re-organize.
We divided the world into regions.
And we shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Mohammed and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tütüncü, Turkey is responsible for the Middle East, K.A. Africa and Turkish Republics.
Mohamed Elsarky is responsible for our global Godiva business, as well as the Americas and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be in charge of England, Continental Europe and Africa.
While Ali <0xC3><0x9C>lker, which I can call a quality and innovation guru, assumes global responsibility in his field, Cem Karaka<0xC5><0x9F> will also help me in managing the business.
China, Russia will be partly South East Asia regions that we will build and develop.
Murat <0xC3><0x9C>lker sold shares in SAF GYO
Murat <0xC3><0x9C>lker continued, "We promise happiness to the whole world at every bite", "The name of our global company we have established to make this happen is Pladis."
“No matter where you invented Pladis, it doesn’t really have a special meaning,” he said.
The Aztecs call it the Maya.
>>uzb_Latn<< Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
We were inspired by the name of the constellation of the Pleiades, consisting of seven stars in Latin, which means Süreyya in Arabic and <0xC3><0x9C>lker in our language.
In other words, we have translated the country globally.
Y<0xC4><0xB1>ld<0xC4><0xB1>z Holding Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors Ali <0xC3><0x9C>lker also emphasized that "we started to create synergies in innovation" by cooperating with laboratories in different countries and added:
We have very valuable R<0x26>D teams, by bringing these teams together, we have achieved certain synergies in the work on a R<0x26>D platform so far.
We have 27 R<0x26>D centers under the Pladis.
The biggest of these are in Turkey and England.
We have over 300 R<0x26>D specialists working here.
Synergy studies have already begun to yield results.
The draje of Digestives, which is produced in <0xC3><0x9C>lker and will start exporting to the UK, is produced in Silivri in the chocolate factory of <0xC3><0x9C>lker.
Another example of synergy: Brands are different, but the products are the same <0xC3><0x9C>lker Krispi Knurled.
We have adapted a cracker technology developed in the UK, namely Jacob's Crinklys product, to Turkey in a short time, and brought a nice taste to our country under the name of <0xC3><0x9C>lker Krispi Knurled.
Laviva, which we are all familiar with, met with consumers in America today.
Call of Duty has exceeded 250 million
This series, in which Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games have engraved their name in gold letters into the game world, will not be forgotten for many years to come.
In particular, the newly announced sales numbers prove just how legendary we need to find.
Activision, which holds the license rights to the series, showed 250 million copies in the number of sales it shared privately at the end of the year.
At the beginning of last year, the company shared the sales of the entire series, and since then it has sold 75 million Call of Duty games.
Of course, the majority of Black Ops 3 games are not that bad.
Kemal K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was elected president once again.
In the Ordinary Congress, Kemal K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was re-elected as president.
K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, who won 990 of the 1,238 delegates who voted, became president again.
Of the votes used, 248 were invalid.
Following the announcement of the result, the parties were in a show of joy.
The CHP had a total of 275 delegates.
The Congress has completed its work to meet at 10 a.m. on Sunday.
In his sermon on the subject, he said:
We wanted to play games, to sing songs.
But it's not encouraging that we're here.
There is an unmanageable reality in Turkey.
The atmosphere overshadows all of this.
The reason for the drought is the country's leaders.
We as CHP people are against terrorism, no matter where it comes from.
Terrorism is a crime against humanity and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terror is done with intelligence, with knowledge, with wisdom.
Of course we want to fight, we want no one to bleed.
How is it different from photos in Syria, Lebanon, photos in the Southeast?
While sitting at the table, they made some serious mistakes.
The blood flowing, the tears, the power of all those who died.
They surrendered the country in 2002 with zero terror, and today there is a Turkey that is turning into a bloodbath.
Who is responsible for these?
The taxi driver in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r is <0xC5><0x9E>ehmuz?
What is Turkey paying for?
We will sincerely participate in the meetings on changing the laws of coup d’etat and convey our thoughts.
We will not allow a country to be built on the personal opinions of anyone.
I said, “Let’s change the soul.”
Their houses are raided in the early morning and taken into custody because the intellectuals of this country have revealed their thoughts.
There are aspects that we disagree with, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictator's rascal says, "He who eats the bread of the state and is hostile to the state."
I would also like to ask him, why didn’t they think while those who ate the bread of the state and exploited all the resources of the state robbed the state?
The CHP is the party that brought the biggest changes to this country.
Together we will prepare for the fourth great revolution.
Whatever the cost, we will bring freedom to this country.
They can arrest us, they can arrest us, no matter what they do, no matter how expensive the price, the CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I'm making a clear call to you, Davutoglu.
Hiding behind coup law, the man who was hiding did not throw the coup mentality out of his head.
You gave the man who gave you the memoir a superior service medal.
What impact are you talking about?
It's all about fooling the public.
The party officials listed the other three revolutions as follows: the 1st great revolution ended the rule and the establishment of the Republic; the 2nd great revolution, the transition from a single-party period to a multi-party period during the Inonu period; the 3rd revolution, the transition to social democracy with Bülent Ecevit...
The President has qualifications and duties.
Article 103 has the oath of the President.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
If a person comes out and makes that promise, he will fulfill it to his death.
Because honor and honor are indisputable to us.
The man who is a dictator, what honor and dignity means to you.
What do you know about honor and honor, and why did you take this oath?
What does honor and honor mean to you?
That's what I want to know.
In a religious man, the concept of honor and honor is the crown of life.
Their intention is not to abolish the law of coup, but to arbitrate the law of coup.
They don’t want the presidential system.
How to Preside; Bossed Presidency System.
Why are you rejecting the Ottoman parliamentary system?
One person will order, and everyone will do what they have to do.
Is the Turkish parliament working in good health?
No, it doesn't.
If we bring liberal democracy, the system will work.
They call it a coup d'etat, but they've strengthened the coup law.
Izmir MP Mustafa Balbay, who announced his candidacy for the presidency, was unable to participate because he could not collect the signatures of the 128 delegates needed for the nomination.
Balbay, who was able to collect 92 signatures, said, “I cannot be a candidate under the current circumstances.”
While there were seats reserved for deputies party council (PM), central executive board (MYK) and honorary board members in the assembly hall, the former CHP Leader Deniz Baikal was seated in the tribunes with the party members.
Gülay <0xC3><0x96>zgükçi, the deputy of Istanbul, instead of sitting in the place reserved for deputies, came early and sat next to the place reserved for President K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
The meeting of Yalova MP Muharrem <0xC4><0xB0>nce with K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu was also one of the topics discussed in the congress backyard.
He also admitted that he had not been offered a PM membership.
However, the head office sources came up with the claim that the request for a meeting came from <0xC4><0xB0>nce and that PM membership was not offered.
<0xC4><0xB0>nce tweeted, "Nobody can learn from these headquarters sources, the content of the meeting, by <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul MP Ali <0xC3><0x96>zcan".
“How can I know about the meeting between two people?”
He just said, "He's gone."
He was often applauded by the press.
On the first day of the usual "Congress on Democracy, Change and Fraternity", the backstage of the party assembly (PM) was marked.
K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu went home after the congress speech and started working for the PM list.
K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu's 100-person key list was prepared by the current MYK members, explaining that he did not want to take part in the administration by calling Yakup Akkaya, Sensar Ayata, Ercan Karaka<0xC5><0x9F> and 13 members of the MYK other than Seyhan Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>du, who were once again nominated to the PM.
K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu may point to a 100-person PM key list as well as another narrowed list.
In the 21-point final declaration adopted unanimously in the CHP Assembly, it was requested to remove comments on the European Local Government Charter, which came to the agenda with the autonomy debates of the DTK, and to increase the sharing of authority in the local area.
The declaration also aimed at "ending the order of the party state" and "establishing a transparent and accountable state of law".
Selçuk <0xC3><0x96>zda<0xC4><0x9F>, Vice President of the AK Party, Idris Baluken of the HDP, and Ruhsar Demirel of the MHP followed.
AK Party <0xC3><0x96>zda<0xC4><0x9F> and AK Party delegation left the hall after K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu harshly criticized President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
He said: “I’ve seen a lot of people criticize me, and I can’t accept it.
In the hall, there were photographs of detainees Can Dündar and Erdem Gül with the banner "How can the darkness go to the light if I don't burn" and the banner "Peace" in Kurdish, Turkish and English.
In the morning, the congress started with Grup Yorum and Ahmet Kaya songs.
The message sent by the wife of Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Baro<0xC4><0x9F>lu President Tahir Elçi, who lost her life in the armed attack, Türkan Elçi's message to the congress was received with great applause.
Berkin Elvan's mother Gülsum and father Sami Elvan also attended the congress.
The part where K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu said that no matter what price he would have to pay, he said he would take democracy "to his death" was the most applauded part of the speech.
So far, the CHP, which has gathered 52 congresses, including 34 usual and 18 extraordinary, gathered its 53rd largest congress at Ankara Arena yesterday.
Participation was high.
There were more than 15,000 CHP members in the 12,000-seat hall.
However, there was no enthusiasm that the crowd deserved.
The most exciting moment was when K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu entered the hall with his wife, Selvi K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
The excitement continued as the K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu couple greeted the hall.
There was no discipline seen in the AK Party congresses.
Even as he spoke, there was a great movement in the field on the field of the Arena.
Obviously, the CHP people who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by explaining themselves to party leaders and journalists.
A CHP executive tried to explain that this is not a bad thing, saying that "it is better to have extra party members, like party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union, lined up like ropes and sit still."
There is another difference between the CHP congress, AK Party or MHP congresses.
At these parties, only the presidents speak.
In CHP, the congress becomes a platform where party issues are also discussed.
When there were too many parties who wanted to speak at the congress yesterday, the chairman of the Divan Murat Karayalç<0xC4><0xB1>n had trouble adjusting the time.
In the faces and languages, "The country is going bad," but there was also a distance to the comments "You will change the course with the table that will come out of this room."
Although all the CHP people said "something to do", there was no consistent and strong answer to the question "what to do."
It was a big impact that there would be no election in the next four years.
When K<0xC4><0xB1>l<0xC4><0xB1>çdaro<0xC4><0x9F>lu appeared on the podium, we journalists waited for what he would answer the question “What to do.”
The son answered the first question, “What’s going on?”
He drew attention to the issue of imprisoned journalists, what was done to academics because of the statement, what happened in the Southeast, and the deadlock in foreign policy.
He has long responded to the "Anatolian myths" about the CHP, such as "it is an unreligious party", "it supports the coup", "it is the party of the elitists".
When it came to the "what to do" stage, he tried to put forward "strategy" instead of talking about concrete steps.
He stressed that all these problems can be overcome with more justice with stronger democracy.
He made a promise on behalf of the CHP and said, “We will work at any cost until we bring democracy.”
“We will fight to the death for democracy,” he said.
One last note; It should be remembered that the CHP has solved the "organization" issue as of the 53rd congress and is now able to collect the congress without problems.
Meanwhile, cards were issued for the 900 journalists who were supposed to follow the convention, but the participation of the journalists in the hall was not at that level.
The representatives of the media organizations in Ankara were not as eager to follow the convention as they were at the AK Party congresses.
Self-defense is a life sentence
The indictment prepared by the Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r General Public Prosecutor's Office on 7 defendants, 3 of whom were detained, was accepted by the 4th Heavy Penal Court.
In the indictment, it was stated that at the instructions and calls of the senior leaders of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization, statements were made under the name of "self-government" in some districts and neighborhoods of Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r, <0xC4><0xB0>stanbul, <0xC5><0x9E><0xC4><0xB1>rnak, Mardin, Mu<0xC5><0x9F>, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and A<0xC4><0xB1>r.
The indictment, which was stated to call for illegal actions from the leaders of the organization and the youth and women's structures, recorded an increase in bombed, long-barreled weapons and rocket-propelled attacks against security forces, public institutions and organizations, citizens' homes, workplaces and vehicles in Sur, Ba<0xC4><0x9F>lar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro districts of Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r.
Isis and opposition clashes, our police station is shot
The recent clashes between Düden, Kara Mezra B<0xC4><0xB1>g<0xC4><0xB1>dd<0xC4><0xB1>n and Daesh and Fatah Army, which were formed by opposition groups in Kara Köprülü Village, in Syria, opposite the Yavuzlu Village of Kilis, continue to intensify.
The sound of gunshots and mortars fired during clashes between ISIL and opposition forces near the border is also heard by Turkey.
While smoke from areas where frequent explosions occurred was visible to the naked eye by Turkey, security forces at the border took intensive measures with armored vehicles.
On the other hand, a harassment shot was fired at the <0xC5><0x9E>ehit Mehmet Border Patrol near the Yavuzlu Village of Kilis, from the village of B<0xC4><0xB1>g<0xC4><0xB1>dd<0xC4><0xB1>n under the control of ISIS militants.
Then, under the rules of engagement, the soldiers responded with obuses and heavy weapons to the area where the harassment fire was opened.
Russian fighter jets allegedly launched an attack on the village of Hamelin, 17 kilometers from the Turkish border.
Six Syrians injured in the air bombing were brought to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
Lotteries get their checks.
The Robinson couple, who live in a small house in Munford, Tennessee, valued at $150,000, chose to receive a single payment of $328 million (about TL 1 billion) rather than a total of $528.8 million ($1.6 billion) over a 29-year period.
The couple said, “There is no guarantee of tomorrow.”
John Robinson, who works in a store chain, and his wife Lisa, who works as an assistant to a dermatologist, said they would be in charge of their business Monday, although they are now millionaires.
With the money they earn, the couple primarily aims to pay off their home loan debt and help their relatives.
It was announced that the jackpot was split into three.
iOS9: How to get the new iPhone operating system, Apple releases the update
By going to Settings for the new operating system, you can tap "Generate" and select "Update Software".
When ready, your phone will give you the option to download and install.
Some users experienced a problem after this installation and received an error message that said "Software update failed".
To overcome this problem, users are advised to wait for a reduction in loading on the system or try to upgrade iTunes from there.
The phone will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may include deleting apps to make room – but Apple has kept this from happening by shrinking the update and recommending some apps to delete and using a special tool to reinstall when the process is over.
It’s worth making sure your phone is charged or is next to a charger so that your battery doesn’t run out while the update is on.
If the charge is too low, Apple won’t allow updates, as the phone can stop halfway through the update.

FedEx’s revenues are mixed, financial outlook will fall in 2016
FedEx has reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant has reduced its profit forecast for the whole year due to a decrease in demand for cargo services and an increase in costs for ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
In pre-opening transactions 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening gong, it fell by about 2.5 percent.
FedEx Corp. expects earnings from $10.40 to $10.90 per fiscal year, which will end next May, which is 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts expected $10.84 based on research by FactSet.
It is likely to decline despite an average 4.9% increase on January 4 and high surcharges on land transportation of heavy or large packages, which will begin in November.
Cost cuts, higher revenues and profits from the growth of e-commerce are still expected to be higher than in the previous year, the company said.
President and CEO Fred Smith said the company "has shown solid performance, especially despite the poorer economic conditions than expected in manufacturing and global trade."
Holiday employment plans were announced a day after rival company UPS, according to which UPS said it plans to recruit 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, the same number as last year.
During the three-month period ending August 31, FedEx raised revenue by 6% compared to the previous year, earning $692 million.
The earnings per share was $2.42, falling behind the forecasts of 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx was hit by a decline in international priority shipping last year, which led to a stagnation of revenue in the Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has elevated FedEx Ground Services results.
In the last quarter, ground services revenue increased by 29%, but business revenue was basically stagnant due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
While revenues fell in the cargo business at high labor costs, the express unit saw high revenues due to high base rates.
In pre-opening transactions about an hour before the opening gong, FedEx shares dropped to $ 3.85 or $ 150.15, down 2.5 percent.
They closed Tuesday with a 11% year-on-year drop and a 17% drop below the record on June 11.
In their most anticipated meeting for years, Federal Reserve politicians decided this week that it was time to raise the interest rate twice, with almost a decade of spending two days around a 27-foot Honduran mashed table.
The two-story meeting room on the wing of the central bank will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed’s female president, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues put the nation’s economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has two tasks from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have acknowledged an unwritten third mandate: the financial balance.
And that third mandate could be factor X in an unpredictable decision on whether the U.S. economy, which will be announced on Thursday, is ready to begin cutting off its unique stimulus support from the near-zero-term interest rate since late 2008.
While most data show that the economy is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in the global financial markets could already make careful Fed officials timid about adding vulnerability by increasing reference federal fund rates — even at less than a quarter of a percent.
"Obviously the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they're watching," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus <0x26> Co.
"But I think if they're looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough ground to wait a little longer," he said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, and this in itself leads to fluctuations in the financial markets.
Half of the economists Bloomberg recently interviewed were expecting a rise in interest rates this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to stand by with the main indicator, which shows a chance of an increase of only about 30%.
This could indicate a drop in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, if policymakers do not mitigate its impact by promising another increase could be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industry index average rose by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group, said: “The increase was triggered by the expectation that Fed policymakers would keep steady this week.
“It would be amazing if the Fed was increasing rates right now,” he said.
If Fed executives had decided to do so, “they would have to take a long year to calm the financial markets so they wouldn’t panic.”
Other experts have suggested that a rate increase could calm financial markets due to the lifting of the fog curtain on when the Fed will take action.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on its way to increasing the rate by 0.25% this month, which would be a small step toward a slow contraction of monetary conditions, strengthening the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said he expects this year’s rate increase in spring and early summer, despite complaints from liberals about the need for a more economic process.
Although the pace of job creation declined in August, growth in the labor market was steady this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest level in seven years, closer to what the Fed deemed full employment.
Salary increases showed signs of improvement.
And although inflation continues to fall below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, Fed politicians say the temporary impact of sharply declining oil prices is a major reason.
Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomy, said the economy "can cope with higher rates and needs it despite the shortage in the labor market."
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month after China went into devaluation of its currency.
The Dow Jones industry index average fell by as much as 16% in May due to investors fearing a slowing Chinese economy could bring global growth down.
The market somehow bounced back when it was now almost 10% below Dow’s high level in May.
The market turmoil for Fed policymakers makes calculating the time when the interest rate will rise is even more complicated.
Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research partner at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Fed official, said: “They may have narrowed down a bit in this meeting over the past few weeks due to the lack of information about the financial markets in the Chinese economy and the lack of information about economic weakening.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least another month to better manage these effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the US economy will be, and they have virtually no data to rely on forcing developments in China to go down in history,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s primary concerns, so technically there should be no factor in landscaping processes.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world’s financial authority.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
Until then, the only clue from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013, the Fed could “reduce” its monetary expansion triggered by worldwide market shakes.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials are expected to not only follow developments elsewhere, but also consult other central bank managers and experts to better study the global economy.
Asset management firm Envestnet Inc.’s global strategy chief, Zachary Karabell, said the decision-making process is “more of a talent than of science.”
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va. President Jeffrey Lacker said this month that "the Fed has been overreacting to financial market movements that seem to be linked to economic fundamentals in the past."
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee and pressuring for a rate increase, cited the 1998-99 resolution as an example.
"Despite limited identifiable recommendations for U.S. growth," Lacker said, "the financial crisis in Asia has caused the Fed to deduct 0.75% in the indicator rate over three meetings."
A year later, the Fed took back those cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England rate determination committee, said: “The Fed should only prioritize financial balance concerns during major crises, as in the 2008 market meltdown.”
He said that the final turmoil is not approaching this level.
You really don’t want to be afraid of going to a rate hike because the markets are resentful, said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and it doesn’t mention financial balance, and I don’t think they should move in that direction until that changes.
Do you want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.

Brazil's Rio Grande Society of Pediatrics encourages healthy eating during breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has resorted to a shocking method by introducing pictures of dairy children depicted with unhealthy food depictions to try and explain to women the importance of healthy nutrition during breastfeeding.
Human milk is made up of many types of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system.
Due to their energy surplus needs, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by around 500 calories.
However, new research shows that the dietary supplements that mothers should take are not limited to calorie intake alone.
According to a new study led by Professor Robert Waterland of Texas Baylor College of Medicine, pregnant women’s healthy diet affects their baby’s genetic expression and protects them against tumor development.
Unfortunately, it has been found that unhealthy eating adversely affects the child’s immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to dominate ratings despite Nine's efforts to take the lead on Today Show
The moves by Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to overthrow the Liberal leadership in Canberra failed to provide a rating boost for Today.
After Tony Abbott's fall of Malcolm Turnbull, Grandma's breakfast show was staged in the national capital.
Hosted in London by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, Rival Sunrise is stuck among the weekly international series, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance problem doesn’t seem to make much difference to Australian viewers, compared to today’s 339,000, Sunrise has an average of 397,000 viewers in five capitals.
Today recorded a slight increase in ratings compared to Tuesday (283,000) on Monday (317.000), but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343.000).
Today has been closing in on Sunrise in recent months.
Today’s average was 318,000, compared to Sunrise’s 330,000 in August.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
By September, the Sunrise average was 349,000, compared to today's 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens in all mornings.
The winds of change are affecting the people this morning more than the parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The big news for Seven was the breathtaking beginning of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a newly widowed father deciding to move to the seaside with his two children in New Zealand reached an impressive average of 1,219 million.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson could run a solo show without Rebecca Gibney, the star of the Rafters.
Last night's result was a resounding "yes."
Seven's X Factor retained its strength with 1,136 million viewers, easily defeating Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven has mixed their night fortunes with Australia.
The first half hour (17:00-17:30) of Andrew O'Keefe's new quiz attracted an average of 446,000 viewers.
In the second half hour (17:30-18:00), the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers – enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000).
Monday Night Tracking Australia's first half-hour reached an average of 520,000 viewers, while the second half-hour increased to 720,000.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
The follow-up Australia's second night's rating drop made Nine think that the Hot Seat would dominate at 5.30.
The follow-up Australia was a change made to McGuire’s show’s Million Dollar Minute that didn’t bite.

The three last remaining singles think Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Has the secret been revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who would win the Singles.
At the end of Sam Wood's bachelor's program, the woman he was going to choose remained in great secrecy.
And the remaining three girls are doing their best not to tell me who took the last rose.
But if we check Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markoski the day before the three of them split, they may have unwittingly given us a clue as to who the winner would be.
Sam Wood seals his mouth until Thursday's final
The three women explained in lyrical language why Wood was perfect, with an emphasis on his humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude, and why they wanted to be his partner.
But their answer to the question, “If it’s not you, who should take Wood’s last rose?” may contain information about who will win The Bachelor’s heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood except themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been very close since the first day.
Jeavons-Fellows said: “From the moment I got home, I felt like they were fit for each other by reading [Sarah’s] energy and Sam’s energy, and I thought so throughout the program.
“Sarah is very practical, it’s fun to be around her,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's a chemistry between them.
They feel very good and comfortable when they are next to each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are going to be a very good couple.
Mackay said last week's home visits made him think Wood was the right person.
“When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was definitely not just a game – I’m totally committed to him now,” he said.
When asked who Wood could choose without him, it was mysterious.
He said, "I don't know if I can say that."
"I love other girls equally - Snezana and Lana are equal."
The Bachelor airs on Ten on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
First post: Is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options in terms of where he would start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest in him after he moved to the U.S., and many other teams approached him after last year’s impressive open practice day.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and that seems to be a wise decision.
Some coaches had Hayne back-up due to his loss in performance in the Australian rugby league, as in a 20–3 win against Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula believed this man and gave Hayne another chance to play in a game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula continued to show her true color to the locker room after the game.
Instead of humiliating the rookies in front of the whole team, he gave them courage.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-match press conference.
Cam Inman, a 49ers team correspondent, said Hayne had also been encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey and had been advised to forget about this drop and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne caused the Minnesota Vikings to score in the first quarter and dropped the ball.
This was not what Hayne and his vast Australian fan base had imagined for their first match in the NFL.
Hayne was seen swearing out of the field after dropping the ball, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy that he could not think of a worse start for his NFL career in 2DayFM 104.1.
Hayne said, "It's just one of those things, you get upset about the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also recalled the 2007 Origin first match with a back pass that made Queensland score.
It was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted the pose on Instagram after holding an Australian flag with fans after the game.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights

Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was imprisoned, the oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his pro-democracy efforts were cut short.
In Nepal, four people died as a result of police squeezing plastic bullets on protesters
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, died Wednesday after police fired plastic bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution.
The incident occurred on Tuesday evening in the city of Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
County chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said 1,000 phase protestors gathered outside a police station, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used pepper spray and opened fire on the air before using plastic bullets.
He said 20 policemen and five civilians were injured.
It's unclear why plastic bullets, which are known to kill but are often used as a less lethal alternative, resulted in such a high mortality.
The conflict was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group suggested that the new constitution-generated regions would dilute their own political influence.
The Tharus ethnic group, which wants to establish its own state, is also protesting in western Nepal.
At least 40 people, 11 of them police officers, have died in violent clashes since August 10.
Four major political parties in this history agreed to divide the country into regions – an important but creative step for the preparation of a new constitution in Nepal, which has been governed by the central state for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been going on since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated this process after the devastating earthquake that occurred in April that killed thousands of people.
Legislators have worked on draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials say the new text will be edited by Sunday.
NHC says there is a 60 percent chance of hurricanes south of Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday that a large low-pressure system up to 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde is 60 percent likely to turn into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecasting center said there was a 60 percent chance of a tropical hurricane in the next two days.
Google launches fundraising campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced a fundraising campaign aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees fleeing their war-torn and impoverished countries into Europe.
Google announced the donation initiative on its blog with an unexpected personal approach.
Instead of a manager making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her own personal experience.
“In our journey, there was hunger, thirst, cold and fear, as well as numerous dark bus and train journeys,” he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe grows, many families, like my family, need help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Children’s Rescue and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will match the first $5.5 million donation at google.com/refugeerelief until it raises $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the biggest of which is the Syrian civil war that has been raging for four years, displaced more than 4 million people this year.
He is also fleeing Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, which have been damaged by many wars.

Weight loss surgery in patients with moderately obese diabetes can help
According to a new study, the benefits of obesity surgery in moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether moderately obese diabetes patients live longer than patients who have not undergone surgery after obesity surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who has written an article on JAMA surgery, an expert on obesity surgery, "it takes a long time for mortality rates to show up."
Weight loss surgeries, also known as bariatric surgery, use a variety of methods to reduce the stomach diameter.
They reduce hunger and restrict the body’s ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with advanced body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
The BMI, which is measured in proportion to the height of the weight, is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that a person is overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 or more are considered obese.
You can calculate BMI at the following link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwan’s full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital used data from the experiment where they compared two types of bariatric surgery – gastric bypass and tube gastric surgeries – which have been performed since 2007 in the treatment of moderate obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
By the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of those who underwent surgery had dropped from 31 to 24.5.
In comparison, BMIs of those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment remained stable around 29.
Diabetes was partially solved in 36% of those who had surgery, and in 28% of those who had surgery.
In the group receiving medical treatment, diabetes was fully resolved in only 1% and only partially in 2%.
In addition, the authors noted that blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the "surgically operated group".
The researchers also visualized blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which reflects the rate of blood sugar in patients over time.
According to the researchers, it is best to keep A1c hemoglobin below 7%.
Postoperative hemoglobin decreased from an average of 9% to about 6%.
In the group receiving medical treatment, it remained stable at around 8%.
But with improved levels of A1c hemoglobin, this better "glycemic control" did not reduce mortality in these five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu, who led the study, and his teammates.
The research team compared the findings with these two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1), and A1c hemoglobin (2.1% to 3.1%), compared to the group with tube gastric surgery, was also more likely to have a total decline (16.9% to 16.9%).
Although the study did not indicate a clear benefit for post-surgery survival at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone of the Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix said it had valid data that surgery extended life expectancy, according to a study in more overweight patients in Sweden.
In this study, Swedish obese patients who had undergone bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years than in any other group with more traditional treatment.
Although this new study has not shown what the benefits of surviving surgical patients are, according to Blackstone, it is relevant and reassuring for people under BMI 35.
This is also the most crucial part of the article, because in the group with low BMI, this surgery is said to be safe, there was no increase in the risk of death or renal ailments, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking the issue of weight gain seriously as the patient’s BMI falls below 27 to 30.
I think we've waited long enough for people to take this matter seriously," he said.
I think it's really hard to reverse this once you've collected these genetic changes that make their bodies associated with obesity and diabetes.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama said that Europe cannot host all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the country of refugees.
At the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK, the Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Center in Oxford.
Under the current circumstances, he argued that the interests of humanity should be put at the forefront rather than the interests of countries or continents.
At the same time, he stressed that, although appreciated, the responses of Western European countries to the refugee crisis are inadequate.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said.
Although he appreciated the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, the Dalai Lama said it was only a temporary solution.
"It's great to take care of a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions, how you can bring lasting peace and sustainable development to these Muslim countries through education," he said.
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We must reduce the use of force.
“The use of force has never been the solution to problems,” he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also referred to what George Bush did after the 9/11 attacks and said that the US’ violent responses had begun a chain of uncontrollable events.
In a letter to President Bush after 9/11, I conveyed my condolences and stated that the way to solve this problem is through non-violent methods.
I know his motives were well-intentioned, but he used force and led to unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
4-fold increase in hand antiseptic in children over the past 4 years
Toxic control centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in high alcohol-containing wet wipe swallows seen in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of cases of hand ingestion of antiseptic in children under the age of 12 reported to the center increased from 3,266 cases in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez told CNN: “Children have become more in demand for such products, and unfortunately there are those with a percentage to be taken to the ER.”
He said that some children drink hand antiseptics knowingly, while others do so in order to impress their friends or in a social media claim.
Videos on YouTube show teens drinking antiseptics for cheap drunkenness.
It has been reported that some adolescents mixed the antiseptic mixture with alcohol-containing mouthwaters to get a firmer drink.
Young children may be attracted to the attractive antiseptic odor.
Lopez said, "The child doesn't think it's a bad thing."
And most of them are the ones that are more attractive.
There are hand antiseptics with strawberries, grapes and orange flavor that are extremely appealing to children.
Hand antiseptics contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few shots can cause alcohol poisoning.
Dr. Stephen Thornton, the head of the Kansas University Hospital poisoning center, told Fox 4 in Kansas City that "high concentration alcohol is alcohol."
You don’t leave a few glasses of whiskey around, but people leave these hand antiseptics out in the open, and that’s an easy way for kids to get a lot of alcohol.
Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who had recently swallowed just four pints of strawberry-scented hand antiseptic at school, was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
The alcohol content in his blood was 0.179, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who took care of him at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta, twice the legal limit of alcohol in an adult.
Nhaijah couldn’t pronounce the words and couldn’t walk when he came to the emergency room.
According to Rithey, because alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, doctors kept her under observation for the night in a separate children's hospital despite any signs of brain trauma.
Anne Ortaria Scott told CNN it was “very scary”.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to keep the contact of antiseptic wipes with the skin short and lift them out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died from swallowing a hand antiseptic containing an unnamed toxic substance.
Health officials have suggested that the substance may not be ethyl alcohol, as listed in the list of ingredients, but methyl alcohol, which has a lethal effect.
In January, three fourth graders from the north of New York City conspired to "place antibacterial products around the class" in order to poison their "bad-hearted" teachers, according to police reports.
The teacher was extremely allergic to hand antiseptics and banned her from using it in class.
The police called this plan a "empty attempt" and proposed disciplinary action to the school administration.

The killer's out there, shaking hands, looking at us and grinning.
Some people try to turn their attention away.
While the killer is in front of our eyes, he creates opportunities for him to escape instead of pointing at the killer.
He's covering for the killer.
He's hiding it.
After he disappears, he tells everyone that he's not actually guilty.
The battle we have fought over the last 10 years is clear.
Someone wants to narrow the circle of fire around us and set us on fire.
Someone is trying to stop it, and moreover, to put out the fire around us.
Someone's trying to tear it down, plunder it.
Someone is trying to make, to produce.
There are those of us who have fought all kinds of wars on our territory.
Civil war.
Interstate war.
The sectarian war.
The proxy war.
And they have subcontractors.
Dirty terrorist organizations.
Bloody clowns.
Different names, formats.

Saudi Arabia has not given up on TUBITAK
Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Fikri I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k stated that the Balistic Image Analysis and Recognition System (BALISTICA) developed by the Scientific and Technical Research Authority of Turkey (TUB<0xC4><0xB0>TAK) has made a new agreement for the sale of a second party to Saudi Arabia and said that the number of BALISTICAN to serve in Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement covering the development and installation of the additional 8 systems.
I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k made statements about BALISTICA developed by T<0xC3><0x9C>B<0xC4><0xB0>TAK Space Technologies Research Institute.
I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k said that the system provided a comparison of ballistic analyses of weapons, bullet cores and shells seized in the incidents to the data found in the central database, thereby eliminating the problems that ballistic experts encountered when examining shells and bullet cores.
Light stated that the data and accompanying information from different geographical locations can be questioned by storing them together thanks to BALISTICA.
Pointing out that one of the most important features of Balistics is its ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data that gives more details and fewer errors, Light emphasized that the ballistics expert’s decisions can be made quickly thanks to the innovations brought by the system, and the success has been greatly increased.
BALISTICA exported under "SUBA-1 Project"
Underlining that BAL<0xC4><0xB0>ST<0xC4><0xB0>KA met all the criteria of success and received a full grade from the General Directorate of Security, I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k noted that the system established in 10 different regions, especially in Ankara, covers the whole of Turkey.
Expressing that the system was opened abroad as a result of the success, I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k recalled that BAL<0xC4><0xB0>ST<0xC4><0xB0>KA was exported under the "SUBA-1 Project" implemented with Saudi Arabia and its installation was successfully completed in 6 regions in 2013.
I<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k said that a new deal for the sale of the second party of BALISTICA to Saudi Arabia has been signed, the SUBA-2, which is a continuation of the SUBA-1, and the number of BALISTICAN to serve in Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement covering the development and installation of an additional 8 systems.
Crocodile fossil found the size of a bus
The prehistoric sea crocodile was reported to be 10 meters in length and 3 tons in weight.
Only the skull of the crocodile was measured at 1.6 meters in length.
The researchers named the species “Machimosaurus rex” and published the findings in the journal Cretaceous Research.
Federico Fanti of the University of Bologna, who is the lead author of the paper, said the 130-million-year-old fossil was “almost the size of a bus.”
Speaking to the Washington Post, Fanti said the colossal saltwater crocodile "was at least at the top of the food chain in a certain region at the time."
Paleontologists have revealed that M. rex, who is believed to be the largest crocodile living in the sea, was ambushed in the lagoons.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is thought to have been the "Sarcosuchus emperor", who lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and was able to reach 12 meters in length and weigh 8 tons.
They're all so confused!
Ece Temelkuran's first book, 'All Women Are Confused', was adapted by Aysa Production Theatre under the same name.
Deniz <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>r, Zeynep Kankonde, <0xC4><0xB0>pek Turkish Source, Kadir <0xC3><0x87>ermik and <0xC5><0x9E>ebnem Sönmez are playing the game Selen Uçer.
'Poz' and 'Dry Squeeze' are still ongoing, but Uçer's first experience of copywriting and directing is questioning the confusion in women's minds.
The game met with the audience at the Trump Show Center last week.
The show starts with a radio show.
In the dark, a voice that takes us to the past years...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing by the window, about to jump down.
Who he is and why he tried to commit suicide is explained by the interference of his neighbors.
A Letter is Leaving.
'Ebru Uysal', played by Deniz <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>r, is a popular writer.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
He's got things in him since he was a kid.
The inability to taste the love of the father, the exclusion in his student life, his lonely childhood, misunderstood relationships, the thought that he did not understand, brought him to this point.
He decided to commit suicide leaving behind a letter, but he couldn't jump out the window.
Because 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde), the mysterious woman who lives opposite the apartment with the talkative and pure cleaner of the adjacent apartment, 'Perran' (<0xC5><0x9E>ebnem Sönmez) speaks to her.
They approach the situation as if it were a normal, normal process.
She gets even more nervous and can't concentrate and jump.
When the famous singer Meltem Kaya, who cleaned her house, joined the conversation between the three, the situation turns into a lot of turmoil.
The 'Multem', who approaches the situation with its own naive and intimate style, cannot stop singing when he sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt takes a different dimension when real estate agent ‘Murat’ (Kadir <0xC3><0x87>ermik) enters the girl’s house with a spare key.
The singer's 'Meltem' giving the press false information is driving things crazy.
Nazan Prenzle's "Street Girl" song is also used in the game.
BUNALIM SMILE
For the first time, Uber managed to maintain the pace and fluidity of the game.
The comedy burden of the game is drawn from Zeynep Kankonde and <0xC4><0xB0>pek Türk.
The caricatured types played by the two; they manage to make the audience laugh with their gestures and lines.
While <0xC5><0x9E>ebnem Sönmez conveys the experience of the years very well to the stage, Deniz <0xC3><0x87>ak<0xC4><0xB1>r also performs convincingly to reflect the depressive mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir <0xC3><0x87>ermik, who mentions his name for his performance in Tolga <0xC3><0x87>elik's award-winning film 'Spira<0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1><0xC5><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>k', also successfully accompanies these four women.
The one-act play, described as a depression comedy, promises to laugh without confusion.
Most of the time, I remember the beautiful words that came out of Perran's mouth, played by <0xC5><0x9E>ebnem Sönmez: They read pencils; they read pencils; they see life.
All children have thought of dying once to punish their parents, and for some reason they have always cried in the end.
She's hanging in the air like an incomprehensible joke.
She's always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important place.
In fact, every story begins with some sort of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pockets; I can't stand things without pockets.
People wonder where to put their hands.
When we are surprised, our hands multiply.
People talk about what they don't understand, and then they invent it.
A misunderstanding is real.
All women are confused because they are confused.
Since you can't die, you have a chance to live.
"Live a long life"
Can be safely consumed at any age
The main ingredient that does not end with counting the health benefits is milk, but the miraculous food that is more beneficial than milk is one of the foods that kefir can safely eat at any age. "It is more nutritious than yogurt because it contains protein, essential minerals and vitamin B."
It is also rich in vitamins B1, B12 and K.
Thanks to its calcium and magnesium content, it forms the basis of a healthy nervous system.
It is also a good source of phosphorus.
The kefir, which also has the ability to keep full, also does not care about weight gain.
He said: “The food is very nutritious and it is an easy drink to digest.”
Deva in every trouble
Specialist Dietitian P<0xC4><0xB1>nar Kural Enç, who explained that children, elderly people, pregnant women and women entering menopause can consume kefir without hesitation, "Kefir is a local drink made mainly in the Caucasus."
But now he has made his name known to the world.
The secret of youth, the long and healthy life elixir, kefir is the cure for almost every problem.
One of the most natural ways to keep babies away from metabolic diseases is kefir.
Friend of the intestines
This unique drink, which does not end in counting the benefits, is a friend of the intestines.
There are 1.5-2 kilograms of bacteria and fungi in our intestines.
Microorganisms in the digestive system are also divided into two groups as beneficial and harmful.
Beneficial microorganisms are called probiotic microorganisms.
The activities of probiotics have as important an effect as our liver, and when consumed sufficiently, it prevents harmful microorganisms in the intestines from sticking and spreading to the intestines wall.
Disruption of the balance of healthy microorganisms in the intestine causes many diseases.
With proper nutrition, the health of the digestive tract should be maintained.
To do this, we must consume sufficient amounts of probiotics.
Eliminates these problems in the intestine
Kefir is the most effective food containing probiotic bacteria, and the beneficial bacteria in it have a huge effect on strengthening the gut system.
It ensures that the beneficial bacteria and fungi in the intestine can multiply and be useful in a healthy way.
With regular use of kefir, the intestines work, intestinal disorders are eliminated, bloating is reduced and a healthier digestion is achieved.
A healthy gut system means a healthy and disease-free body.
"Kefir, which is also good for conditions such as lack of appetite, insomnia, upper respiratory infections and allergies, also helps to get better quality vitamins and minerals that babies will get from food, so it also plays an important role in baby nutrition," he said.
He wants to continue where he left off.

Letters from small students
In order to encourage the police and soldiers carrying out terrorist operations in the region, the central Sur district of Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r received letters from children in the west.
Starting at 75.
<0xC4><0xB0>stanbul West Ata<0xC5><0x9F>ehir High School of Natural Sciences and Eski<0xC5><0x9F>ehir Ata<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1> Middle School started to work in coordination with students.
As a result of these studies, students in schools printed the choreography of the shape of the moon star to chocolates, and then wrote about a thousand letters of poetry and painting.
The children then sent their work to the Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Police Department.
The Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Police Department has set up an exhibition table related to the work coordinated by children in the West.
In the exhibition established in the new Police Directorate building, students’ work was included.
The exhibition was first visited by the police and the citizens serving in the Police Department building.
The letters and paintings in which meaningful writings and poems were written touched those who read them.
A student who wrote a letter about the operations in the district of Merkez Sur said, "Dear policemen, we are grateful for the sacrifices you have made to protect innocent people in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r."
It is reported that the exhibition will last until next week.
He named his daughter Angela Merkel.
The name of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been criticized at times for her policies towards refugees, has been given to another refugee baby.
The 26-year-old Memun al-Hamza and his wife Tema al-Havar, 21, who managed to escape the war in Syria and reach Duisburg, Germany, named their first child Angela Merkel.
Speaking to the German press, Tema Al Hawar said: “We are grateful to be here.
“We named our daughter Angela Merkel to show that.”
Mamun al-Hamza said: “Germany has become like a mother to us.”
This is the second 'Merkel'.
Angela Merkel was born on December 27.
According to German media reports, the little Angela Merkel, who weighs 300 grams and is 55 centimeters tall, is in good health.
Last year, a Ghanaian refugee named his daughter Angela Merkel, and a number of other refugees opened "Mother Merkel" banners in support of Merkel.
Consumer confidence in the U.S. peaks at 7 months
According to university data, UMICH increased by 0.7 points in January to 93.3.
With this result, the market expectation for the index, which recorded its highest level since June 2015, was 92.9.
Richard Curtin, Michigan’s Director of Consumer Studies, said in a statement: “Consumer confidence has brought its rise to the fourth month with the improvement of prospects for future economic growth.”
"Individual financing expectations have also maintained their highest level since 2007 due to the weakness in inflation in general," he said.
The statement also predicted that consumer optimism would now depend on inflation to continue to remain extremely low.
UMICH, which recorded its best annual performance since 2004 with an average of 92.9 last year, is determined based on the results of a 50-question survey with at least 500 people each month.

While Russia is preparing to recognize the status of "can do business with Russia" to Turkish companies if Turkey cannot meet the services offered in another way, the Association of Tour Operators of Russia said that "Russian citizens do not give up on Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which calculates that the breakdown of existing economic ties with Turkey will cost Russia an additional cost, has prepared and published to the Russian government a new draft "Exceptional Situations" for Turkey.
According to the draft published in the Russian Federal Regulations directory, it is envisaged that Turkish companies and firms will be allowed to do business with Russia even if they enter the area of sanctions if necessary.
According to the draft, it is impossible to provide from other sources other than Turkey or the products and services of Turkish companies and companies can be used in cases where domestic production in Russia will bring serious additional costs.
Which goods and services of Turkish origin will be included in this category will determine a mixed commission to be set up jointly with other relevant ministries within the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
Thus, it will be able to decide which Turkish company can work with Russia by choosing bureaucrats.
According to the same document, private companies with state agencies in Russia will have to prove to the commission that their work with Turkish partners is not equivalent.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government, a record of Turkish companies with privileges will also be created in Russia.
The Russian Tour Operators Association said in a statement yesterday that Russian citizens did not give up on Turkey.
"Despite the ban on the sale of tours and the advice of the Russian Foreign Ministry not to go to Turkey, our citizens began to look for a formula for organizing their holidays alone," the statement said.
The number of posts on social networks on the Internet titled ‘The most practical and cheapest way to vacation in Turkey’ is growing like an avalanche.
The most common suggestion is to book a hotel online and fly with your.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the price of oil falling below $30 as a "dramatic" development for Russia.
"It was a very bad surprise for our government, as no one had ever imagined that the oil would fall to $30.
It seems that the current budget will not be able to be fulfilled.”
This is the last month of 2015 that we left behind.
After the plane crash, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that economic sanctions will deepen.
In those days, our businessmen, who are trying to go to Russia in the usual order, our THY personnel are officially suffering at the border gates.
Turkish goods are crawling in customs and subject to unthinkable controls.
It’s been a month, not a month, and yesterday Nerdun Hac<0xC4><0xB1>o<0xC4><0x9F>lu reported from Moscow.
One way or the other, it's getting soft.
But why?
The reason is simple.
In an era where the economy is so globalized, your efforts to close the border with the methods of a century ago to turn political conflicts into economic wars are no longer enough.
Look, we are still writing about Iran and how the economic embargo, which has been imposed for years, has been pierced.
The two neighbouring countries, which seem to be very friendly, like Russia and Turkey, but in essence not so much, are actually in need of each other.
It is not technically possible to separate these two countries that have merged with a businessman, a tourist, an entrepreneur, a client on a night like that.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other’s country through a chimney.
It is best to have a political discussion at the table and to settle there without creating new sanctions, Reza Zarrab (Reza Zarrab).
Without messing with the economy...
Hotel attack in Burkina Faso kills 20 people
At least 20 people have been killed in a car bomb attack at the Splendid Hotel in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.
Burkina Faso Interior Ministry officials said security forces found 20 bodies, some in the hotel's lobby and some in the hotel's cafe.
The French special forces-backed security forces have rescued 63 hostages, including the Burkina Faso Minister of Labor, 33 of whom were wounded.
It is not known how many hostages and attackers were in the 147-room hotel.
Eyewitnesses said two bomb-laden vehicles exploded just outside the Splendid Hotel, preferred by the United Nations personnel and foreigners, and three or four masked people entered the hotel.
Sad news from the city: one of them is dead.
In Sur district where the curfew continued on the 46th day, the police officer Ali Bulud<0xC4><0xB1>k, who was seriously injured as a result of the explosion of the hand-crafted explosive caught by terrorists yesterday and was taken to Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Military Hospital, became a martyr despite all the interventions made.
It was found that the city was registered to the Adana population.
They did not support the terrorist act!
According to the information obtained, at 17.00 in the evening, a voice action against the operations was planned in front of AZC Plaza on Ekinciler Street in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r Yeni<0xC5><0x9F>ehir district Office district.
No one at the desired level participated in the voice-over action, where citizens were invited with brochures and calls.
Thousands of people took part in the previously held demonstrations, but the citizens did not support the recent actions.
The group, which failed to provide a sufficient majority in front of AZC Plaza, was disbanded before it could carry out its actions because it did not receive support from Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r citizens.
Terrorists set fire to school in Diyarbak<0xC4><0xB1>r
According to the information obtained, the incident occurred on 1007th Street in the Yunus Emre Quarter of the central Ba<0xC4><0x9F>lar district.
A group of masked terrorists, who entered the Nuri Zekiye Has Middle School around 19:30 p.m., fled after throwing molotov cocktails and setting the building on fire.
Residents around the building reported the situation to the fire department.
The fire department also called the police and asked for security measures to allow them to enter the area.
A large number of police teams were deployed in armoured vehicles to the area.
Firefighters who arrived at the school after receiving the security extinguished the fire before it engulfed the entire building.
Then, while police teams were conducting a crime scene investigation, multifaceted work was undertaken to capture the escaped terrorists.
On the other hand, some cops at the scene helped reporters take pictures, while a cop tried to block journalists who wanted to take pictures.
ATM Thieves Arrested
Police teams affiliated with <0xC4><0xB0>zmir Police have started a study on the complaint that some people’s bank card information was copied and withdrawn money from their accounts except their information.
As part of the investigation, the police determined that the perpetrators were M.M.G (43) and R.O (32), and that the suspects had copied the information of the citizens' cards with the help of a “card copying device” and “mini camera” they placed in ATMs in different provinces of Turkey.
Suspects who learned their card passwords were found to be trading with these cards.
During the operation, the suspects were arrested.
After examining the laptop used by M.M.G. and R.O, the teams seized a large number of video recordings of the mini-camera set-up to get the passwords of the citizens who traded at ATMs, determining that the suspects stayed in the provinces for short periods of time to avoid being caught.
It was also revealed that the suspects had made an unfair profit of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 by copying on 15 different ATMs in <0xC4><0xB0>zmir.
The suspects who were taken to the court after their actions in the police department were arrested.
Authorities have warned citizens to check their account movements regularly against such incidents and to cover their hands during password entry at ATMs.
Netherlands: Assad to be tried in The Hague
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be tried at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.
Speaking at a conference in The Hague, Koenders said Assad was responsible for the influx of refugees.
As long as Assad is in power, peace will not come to Syria, Koenders said:
Assad must be tried at the UCM in The Hague.
A man with so much blood on his hands must be held accountable before the court.
Assad is also the sole responsible for the influx of asylum seekers that we are facing right now.
However, I am aware that Assad will not leave his post anytime soon.
This issue needs to be discussed first, and Russia needs help in this regard.
Protests against Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz
In the 59th minute of the match against Medicana Sivasspor, protest whistles rose when Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz did not reach the goal of passing Sneijder.
Then he turned to face the people who were holding his hand.
Then the reactions increased, and protest whistles were heard every time the goalkeeper had a ball on his foot.
Then some tribunes supported Burak Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz and protested against supporters who reacted to their own players without any sense.
Then, a large portion of the crowd cheered for him.
Rumor Cauldron: There is no disharmony in Celtic
When Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place and she's gonna get over it, Griffith ignores the words of incompatibility at Celtic.
The struggle of the hearts, with Warburton's timidity in the face of the SFA's punishment for Neilson and the January signatures that broke the team's unity.
Leader Dons score five points against Celtic
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a just win against Hamilton in Pittodrie, and gave the Dons the opportunity to make a five-point difference between them and the Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about words of incompatibility
In Celtic, the rhetoric that creates the gossip of incompatibility pushes Griffith to the back of his hand and says that he and his teammates have no difficulty in any way with an increased sense of admiration as they prepare to face the Dutch League Leaders.
I don’t think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The absence of the Scottish title race bothers the Dutchman de Boer
Ronald de Boer, former Rangers midfielder and former internationally renowned player of Dutch football, says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as they no longer compete with the Rangers.
De Boer, who is already an Ajax ambassador, said: “They don’t give Celtic matches summarys anymore in the Netherlands, why not?”
The Rangers are no longer there.
People aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old team.
When they talk about teams, they talk about it.
The old team’s matches were tense, and the Scots weren’t the only ones who wanted to watch them.
I'll make things right, Deila swore.
RONNY admitted that Deila Celtic was struggling, but the Norwegian boss said it would reverse the trend.
The defeat against Malmö and then immediately after the Champions League farewell followed the loss of the match against Aberdeen, who is now in the lead position by a five-point margin in the scoreboard.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad times in the past. We will come back again."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know the situation is very disappointing, and I know a lot of people are angry or upset about what's going on.
We’re in the same situation – but we have to keep going.
We really, really need Celtic’s support because it makes the players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's timidity in January transfers
Just a couple of weeks ago, despite some comments that he set his January transfer goals, Rangers boss Mark Warburton hesitated to sign, insisting that Ibrox did not want to disrupt his team.
The former Brentford teacher said, “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
For players who come in the summer, there’s a pre-season period where you’ll get to practice with them, we’ve seen that in our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes it hurts even more to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic is targeting Michu for retirement.
Swansea striker Michu was tied up with Celtic in the transfer window, and wasted his predictions that he might retire when his contract with the Swans ended.
At the age of 29, he suffered two years of unbearable pain from a problematic ankle and found no way to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts Prepare for SFA Battle on Neilson's Comments
The Hearts were 2-1 ahead when Paterson was kicked out of the game, and then they lost 3-2, which reversed everything after the defender's red card—Collum's third red card to be canceled in eight months.
Neilson insists: “I never questioned the union, I never commented on the performance.”
Griffiths tried to prevent Tynecastle
The obsessive Hibee was scolded when she sang a song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel with offensive lyrics.
The incident occurred in March 2014 at a bar in Roseburn, Edinburgh, ahead of the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby match and it was warm at the time," he added, adding, "I can definitely say that I will not go to Tynecastle from now on except to play against Celtic.
Tannadice board trusts Dundee United administration - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly still has confidence that the Dundee United board’s management team will fix things – but they agree that the downturn on the field should come to an end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
“We’re going to get the kids ready to go again,” Donnelly said.
Mclness is pleased with Hamilton's "ugly win"
Derek Mclness admits that the Aberdeen team had to desperately cling to the Hamilton Accies to see their seventh consecutive win, which, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half, led them to the top of Celtic's five points in the league rankings.
Mclnnes said: “There is no team that wins without winning a game in this way, whether it’s cups or leagues.”
Unemployment rates in England rise, while rates among Scots remain the same
Unemployment remained unchanged in Scotland between May and July at 164,000, while the number of unemployed across the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
According to the National Statistics Office (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 percent higher than in the UK.
Employment in Scotland, on the other hand, fell by 12,000 in three months, and the number of people currently employed remains at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland has fallen to 74.0 percent — above the average of 73.5 percent in the UK.
State Secretary David Mundell, in charge of Scotland, commented on the latest figures: "The government's long-term plan laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It has been almost a full year since Scotland decided to remain part of England.
We have seen improvements in the Scottish labour market over the past 12 months with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why I Witnessed an Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, I'm going to watch a man be killed because of a late legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'll be sitting in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Prison watching as Richard Glossip is being executed by a fatal injection.
He wanted me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made through his best friend in January, and I accepted, no matter how shocked I was.
As that day drew nearer, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
It will offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to monitor executions in America, and as there are more apps than current locations, a terrifying lottery emerges when deciding who to choose.
Oklahoma has reduced its media seats from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen will watch it without feeling it.
I can't do that.
I’m going to sit next to Richard Glossip’s best friends, and over the past months, I’ve developed a relationship with him through phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities said I could not be both a witness and a journalist, so I will not be given a pen and a notebook to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me of compromised neutrality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes it, gain access.
I complained to him.
He admitted that he could "speak it better," but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with me on some of the things I say and write.
He didn't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could get me off the witness list whenever he wanted.
But he wants an international reporter to be there and write about it.
If he dies, he thinks that public dissemination will help the anti-murder movement.
A reporter from the Huffington Post, with Kim Bellware.
If you want to know more about this, please listen to my podcast series.
I won’t repeat all the details here.
I have no idea if Richard Glossip is innocent.
What Barry Van Treese did after his death is enough to make him an accomplice.
But I still believe he's not guilty of the murder.
I don't think there's enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm gonna watch her die from this perspective.
I can’t say I’m really objective.
You can look at the other reporters there.
The impressions you'll get from me, the impressions you'll get from watching the death of a man who was unnecessarily killed and loved.
Man convinced from Canning River after wet police chase
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry as he pulled the man out of the Canning River.
The alleged escape from the police car behind a man from Perth ended in shallow and muddy water in an effort by a police officer to "convince himself gently to come back to shore".
Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday for an intrusion in Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, the man entered the Canning River and tried to escape from the police.
But he didn't get very far.
“Senior Sergeant Sergeant Shandell Castledine was standing in the water and saying, ‘I’m not going out, come and get me.’
Police Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want to wet his uniform and used a more secure tactic - "good police negotiation".
He said, “Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape.”
Champion footballer Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins left his car to escape alcohol control and tried to swim across the Swan River.
Their efforts were unsuccessful, but they inspired locals to plan a joke Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims the butlers had ratted him out and threatened him to quit the race
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria butlers were trying to make a run in their own stables last year, threatening him to leave the race immediately.
Racing targeted Victoria's butlers and the union department, saying they were conducting a personal campaign against her to derail Lady Tatai in the final feed for the race on Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in the races, and told Lidari that he found himself in difficult circumstances that he could not explain when the job gave a positive result to cobalt.
He said he had been biting his tongue for 18 months in the face of rumors that he didn’t want to “look like drunken grapes.”
“I wasn’t going to say that, and I covered it up for a long time, but sometimes you get very angry and everything happens all of a sudden,” Moody said.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you react and you suffer the consequences, and I will suffer the consequences of what I say.
I'll sleep well when I get home tonight.
I want to keep my head up and let my bosses know that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start to think I'm not doing it, it means I'm no longer a trainer.
I'd wonder what I'd do with my license.
Previously, Moody had a race.com interview where he detonated a bomb that accused the union department of spying in his own barn.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - if I'm asked - and they offered to give him a job in my stables in exchange for telling them what I was doing in the stables," Moody said on Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a cheater.
If that's the case, they're all gonna have to return their badges because they weren't capable enough to catch me.
Robert Roulston, the former president of RVL, David Moodie, the new president of RVL, and the current general manager of RVL knew it then and now they know it.
Does that make me think you're starting to be personal?
The RVL has a number of balls, and maybe it wants to make people other than trainers responsible for what’s going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I have no doubt what my words will make them think.
But I don't care about anything when I get there, and it upsets me.
It really upsets me.
I'll put pressure on them, I'll put the responsibility on them to decide.
I have the support of my family and I walk.
The coach’s long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari and his disappointment with the subsequent scratch incident made him say, “Throw my license across the table.”
Famous for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, Moody described the race day care rule as "ridiculous" and said it was against the rules to put mud or clay potatoes on the horse's feet.
This is against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for that.”
One of my men accidentally put the mud in his foot.
He could have taken it last night.
He could have had it yesterday, and he did.
He took it on race day.
Moody could face a three-month suspension for using porridge on race day care as a result of the managers' investigation.
It's a joke.
Those who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
“We understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who crashed and ran away in Cobram was arrested.
Police arrested a man who ran away after hitting a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he was hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning due to serious injuries.
Police say the driver fled the scene without assistance.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia surrendered to the police station in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with not stopping in an accident, not helping, and other traffic crimes.
The 40-year-old cyclist in Cobram remains stable at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responded harshly to opponents’ claims about wrestling
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described the criticisms targeting his own team as a "planning effort" for the NRL's two favorite titles.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said on Friday night that they had allowed the referees to "fight" with their own team in a semi-final match in Sydney where Storm was defeated.
After the Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett won the semi-finals against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, he called the match "a lesson" for the Rugby League and said the two Ouenslands weren't "very big" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team's struggle and said they focused only on "contact" while fighting.
Bellamy said he was powered by criticism from the two leading coaches who came to his team because this meant they were worried that Storm would beat them.
This is going on – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when they beat us 24-2, Bellamy said on Wednesday.
“I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year round, only in the last six weeks we have put a real emphasis on our fighting contacts, and that has been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and obviously he's got a big team he's been coaching, and he's probably not used to losing with a little shock.
It’s funny that this happened at this time of year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett's idea of "exciting football," recalling Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons win by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his Saturday night match to our Friday night match and how exciting their match was,” Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010, St. George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't give a rat ass.
But now they have a team to play football, which we can call exciting football, and especially their young half with their speed.
This is the kind of football you want to play when you have these types of players.
He made that point in 2010, now everyone wants to play football in this style – not every team has a half-double like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so it’s not possible to play in this way.
That gives me more confidence because even they talk like that because they’re a little bit afraid to play.
They probably didn't think of us six weeks ago when they went to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven’t seen it yet, but what was its score? 16-12?
Our game is 20-18, our game has more scores on both sides, but is this exciting football?
Or is it exciting to stop the attacks but not to make the scoring attacks?
This is the day for me.
If they're talking about us, it means we're going to meet them here sometime in the future.
There is no this weekend as Storm won tickets to either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in their first final game, which went on sale on Tuesday, on Saturday night at AAMI Park.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail for drug charges
The man, who was caught on 40 kilograms of cocaine that had been smuggled into Queensland and facing a possible life sentence, was released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five people arrested last month by the federal police who tracked down the 100-pound drug from the Solay yacht that came from South America via Vanuatu and landed at the port in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen at a meeting with his accomplices at the marina during the morning and later met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug inside a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a potential life sentence for possession of commercial quantities of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer said there was no evidence that he was attempting to own all the drugs and that he might be in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was at risk of an escape.
They have open connections to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he was staying in the public case.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather together offered him $200,000 to bail him out.
“After reading the sworn statements of both men, it is clear that the $200,000 bail fee is a real financial burden on them,” Judge Flanagan said.
But he warned that this alone was not enough to keep him from going to trial.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for handing over both Australian and Serbian passports, going to the police station every day and complying with the curfew between 6am and 6pm.
Stevan Hogg uses girls' phone to lure pedophiles to send images
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, signing in to an online messaging service, providing her with a series of inappropriate child images sent to her by another user.
The girl then woke up and realized she didn’t have her phone and found her phone in Hogg’s hand, who was sleeping.
She looked at him and immediately noticed the disturbing messages before she warned her mother.
The police were interested and saw five pictures, then analyzed the computers at the address and discovered "related" web searches using terms to find inappropriate children's pictures.
Hogg later claimed that the reason he did this to the officers was to "manage the pedophiles" on the Internet and "act like a cop and scare them."
Financial deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "It's an addiction - it's an addict that scares people.
He admitted that the calls were made by the computer, but said he did it to scare the pedophiles into pretending to be a police officer.
He was asked about his interviews with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send them more pictures.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he got sick when he drank and wanted to watch video of rape and murder.
Mrs Robertson added: “When she found the messages on her phone, she called her mother screaming and shaking and crying.
Anne saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone, and the charges came after her.
The girl was interviewed, and she said that the defendant used a computer and a Playstation to look younger than he was.
Hogg, 23, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, was convicted on June 14 last year of taking or producing improper child pictures, violating bail on January 25 this year, and not attending court on March 24 this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim said Hogg should not be included in the category of sexual offences, as there may be a discussion that there is no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the case until October, when his social background study report will be published.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was held on probation for other unusual cases.
Sexual offences were recorded before the date of sentencing.
In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe made a wrong speech in parliament.
Africa's oldest leader, Mr. Mugabe, fell down the stairs as he climbed down a podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was tainted by allegations by opposition lawmakers that they had received anonymous death threats if they had wooed him during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
In his speech to the nation in parliament last month, he was booed and repeatedly interrupted — he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Democratic Movement for Change (MDC), said that seven opposition politicians had received messages on their cell phones to prevent Mr Mugabe from disturbing them during his speech.
"After Mr. Mugabe's speech is over, the message to the journalists comes from a number that is not visible, but the title is 'death'," he said.
Members say their immunity is valid within parliament and that immunity does not work when they leave parliament.
The chief spokesperson said he was “concerned” by threats to the party’s politicians, led by Morgan Tsvangirai.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will end between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in corporate service reorganization and cost reduction efforts.
Later this year, HP will be split into two listed companies; computer and printer jobs will be separated from faster-growing company hardware and service operations.
HP said in a statement that the expected layoffs would result in a cost of around $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
"These restructuring activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company," said Meg Whitman, HP's president and executive chairman, who will preside over the unit after the departure.
"The Whitman, Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we'll have a broad and deep portfolio to help companies transition to a new way of doing business," he said.
As a separate company, we are much better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Company's annual revenue will be more than $50 billion and will focus on providing "no-competitive integrated technology solutions" for companies, according to a statement from the company.
Their garage in Palo Alto is called "The Birthplace of Silicon Valley" and is split into two companies that were founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to build electrical equipment.
HP is undergoing a major reorganization to deal with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world’s largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technology firms, is one of the last moves in the industry in the belief that firms with a strong focus are performing better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says Wilshere's teammates are having trouble with injury before the match at Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury occurred in September and his treatment was planned, with no reason for him not to play during Christmas.
The best-case scenario already means that Wilshere will definitely miss at least four matches in the UK, and given his background, it is unclear whether he will participate in the European Championship next summer.
The most embarrassing aspect of the last problem is that Wilshere had a strong end last season after a separate ankle injury and then searched for his old sharpness before the season.
This type of disability is not threatening his career, Wenger said.
This is a bone that hasn't fully recovered.
It's nothing big.
It was just an accident.
This has nothing to do with his wrists or previous injuries.
From a medical perspective, this may be true, but as Wenger will admit, there is also the risk of further injury to a returning player in the middle of the season.
There's also a disturbing pattern that's developing.
According to a study by Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different ailments recorded since its inception six years ago.
In the last five seasons, Arsenal played only 65 of 157 league matches.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of two First League teams that have lost in six of eight seasons since 2007-08, often due to injury.
Wenger recognizes the potential for a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believes it will continue to recover from last season’s injury record.
"Sometimes you have an open period of injury when you come back from an injury, a process where you want to strengthen your body and win the fight," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust him, and I believe he will have the career he deserves.
Arsenal, which will start the Champions League fight on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, will have Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, which Wenger is preparing for.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not go to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy will play Arteta.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players the breath they need," Wenger said.
Despite being a clear favorite of Arsenal's Group F, Zagreb's Maksimir Stadium is one of Europe's most hesitant stadiums.
Dynamo has been undefeated for 41 games since last season's self-produced "Forgotten" campaign.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 magnitude on the Richter scale on Tuesday night.
This is the 10th earthquake in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has learned the necessary lesson from last season's defeat against Monaco in the Champions League and continues to be motivated by the club's far-fetched goal of achieving its first European Cup victory.
“This motivation is huge,” Wenger says.
This has never been the case at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have enough experience to be realistic.
We are passionate, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy program that teaches us serious lessons about interpersonal friendship
The lack of similar portrayals in the programs is remarkable, especially at a time when men need it more to open up, and suicide rates among young men are at the peak of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the leading cause of male deaths between the ages of 20 and 45; and it was three times higher in men than in women.
To draw attention to this problem, the Campaign Against Miserable Living (CALM) has declared 2015 as the Year of the Man and aims to challenge the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to accomplish this challenging task.
A study of more than 2,000 high school students who showed depressive symptoms showed that the person suffering from this distress had a double chance of recovery if they had a high number of friends in "healthy mode."
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the mental difficulties that may arise.
But of course, friendship must be accessible first to work.
In this age of social media-heavy communication; with a focus on style rather than content, it makes immediate response rather than meaningful communication a priority.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look like powerful, fun-loving and successful people, even if in reality everything is head-on insulation.
Artificial success is being spent on what psychologists call externally-driven values; under the rule of money, image, social status; in pursuit of them, internal values that have a deeper impact on our mental health – our inner longing for personal development and friendship.
As a billionaire video game creator recently explained, money doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it turned this focus upside down.
Characters were defined not by their work, but by their personalities, and they showed that by their interactions with their friends.
The frequent hugs of Joey and Chandler, the moments they watch football in comfortable chairs, Ross's relationship with Rachel, all came from the knowledge that they could actually relate to them even if they were in the back of the mind to fully explain the feelings of the men.
A benevolent employee told me, “When I listened to people who were depressed and suicidal, I saw how even the smallest interactions between friends could make a difference.”
Most of the men who contact us are unable to talk to their friends.
“The feeling of ‘passing over’ is very strong, and the idea of opening up to others is also a sign of weakness.”
One of the programs that comes to mind when proposing long-term coping mechanisms is Friends.
She emphasized the little moments of her boyfriend.
In line with my goal, a foreigner’s status on the phone helps people in times of difficulty, but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you’re attending FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where the scenes are redesigned for the celebration?
Or, better yet, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You don’t know how your friendship will make a difference.
Friends, from beginning to end on Comedy Central – all 236 episodes – streaming for <0x23>FriendsFest
Di Maria made it easier for PSG to beat Malmö
After a goal against Malmö, Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani.
At the start of the Champions League, Angel Di Maria made it easier for PSG to beat Malmö with a goal on Tuesday.
Here's the game report and the reactions to the game.
In the match against Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League with an extremely relaxed and clear 2-0 win over Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria was a PSG player who allowed the French champion to continue in the Champions League with a goal in just four minutes, but failed to take advantage of the opportunity until Cavani scored the second goal with his head in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, not only to get out of the qualifying groups, but also to improve their quarter-final performances in the last three championships.
But the game they played when they scored wasn't the best game of the era for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of time around the penalty area and was later sidelined by his hometown team, where he began his majestic career in 1999.
"Winning in and out of the Champions League is not easy, so winning 2-0 will create problems for our opponents, and while there are some things we need to improve on during the season, it's a good start to give a comfortable look back," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
“Even though we didn’t score one or two more goals, we wanted to win and we won.
Ibrahimovic returned to Paris with one of three changes to the 2–2 match against Bordeaux in League One after injury, but remained in Di Maria's shadow for the fourth minute.
When the Argentine wing player was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as the player who would bring the PSG to a higher level in Europe, and when Marco Veratti ran behind Malmö's defense and sent Johan Wiland to the net from the far corner, he proved that it was not wrong.
However, everyone was disappointed when they expected the PSG to win a big victory.
Malmö, who had eliminated Celtic in the playoffs for this round, was lined up on the field with nine international players, a five-man defender and two midfield depth players, a heavyweight opponent.
At the 34th minute, there were very few attacks, except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot at the pole of the corner that Kevin Trapp was guarding.
The PSG, on the other hand, gave them the opportunity to slow the game down with unnecessary passes and inefficient last shots, in the first half Ibrahimovic failed to make the finishing move in at least five strikes, and in the second half he was disappointed to not be able to keep up with Cavani's game.
However, when he came to organise his co-workers, he proved to be more skillful, at the 52nd minute it was Ibrahimovic who gave him the pass of the twisted shot that Di Maria sent to Wiland's castle.
The second goal came after a full hour, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan player recorded his sixth goal of the season with the head Maxwell made from the left wing after Ibrahimovic's pass.
Malmö's ideas of returning to the match ran out, and after an unrecognized goal by Ezequiel Lavezzi, who later entered the game, Wiland perfectly saved David Luiz's free throw and did not allow the score to change.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class superior to his own team, the Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League match was in December of last year.”
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not on the same level as him.
Teams are not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore generates $2.5 billion in share sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore was hit by falling prices of processed goods and sold its shares on Wednesday, earning $2.5 billion.
Glencore, which is listed in London, announced that it has sold <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay off its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, was severely affected by the falling prices of goods as China’s economic slowdown caused a surge in demand and caused confusion in the markets.
The issue of rights caused Glencore's stock prices to rise on the London Stock Exchange early Wednesday morning.
Stocks rose 0.69 percent higher in the FTSE 100 index, up 2.77 percent to 131.60 pennies.
Glencore announced last week its $2.5 billion stock sale plan, which is part of its plan to cut its $30 billion debt pile by a third.
The company sold its new bonds for 125 cents per share, a 2.4% discount from Tuesday’s closing.
He sold 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over China’s long-standing growth have cut iron ore prices roughly in half, while coal, copper and other goods have fallen between 20 and 40 percent.
White House confirms visit of Xi Jinping to Washington
The White House confirmed Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a return visit to Barack Obama, who arrived in Beijing last November.
Following bilateral talks between the two presidents, the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will have a dinner in honor of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
"President Xi's visit will expand U.S.-China cooperation on regional and global issues, as well as bilateral relations, and will allow President Obama and President Xi to constructively address disputed issues," the statement said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to visit Seattle before Washington to meet with some U.S. technology leaders and then move to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address some controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about allegations that China is conducting cyber espionage activities, and China’s claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes diversity in filmmaking seem trivial
Matt Damon opposed African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying it was not necessary to be behind the camera during an argument about diversity.
In the Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, which aired on HBO, Brown interrupted the seasoned actor while highlighting alternative perspectives on the black main character in the project's selected script.
Damon claimed that when we talk about diversity, you do this not in the cast of the show, but in the cast of the film.
Brown, who was shocked, reacted to the Martian actor's comments, saying, "Wow! Okay."
Damon and Brown were brought together by co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
Brown said: “I wanted to make people think about how they would treat the Adaptation character, no matter who the director is.”
The only black character is a hooker shot by a white talker.
The publisher of Dear White People insisted that the finalists, Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio, demand the right to direct the film.
After the discussion was published, there was a boom of discontent over Damon's comments on social media.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the cut, writing: “WHITE ISE can explain its diversity as painful because Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room.”
After the tweet was sent, it received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments came at a time when the right racial expression in the media was at the forefront of social debate.
After being killed in 2014 by a young white police officer named Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement effectively encouraged lawmakers and authorities across the country to stop discriminating against people of color.
In February, singer Prince covered the move top-down when nominees for Album of the Year were announced at the Grammy Awards.
The albums are still important, he said.
Albums like books and black lives are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued a statement in response to the question of Elisabeth Hasselbeck, a prominent figure in Fox News, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group, the Leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was included in the list of performing artists, producers and media bosses invited to visit the Pope to discuss the identification of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not yet clear whether he accepted the invitation or whether he met with the Pope.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowned his first champion
Isaac Caldero, a professional rock climber and comedian, became the first athlete to win a $1 million prize on Monday night, winning the American Ninja Warrior program.
This competition, which entered season 7, had never seen a contestant who could complete all the stages of the obstacle course before.
In the season finale, Caldero and Geoff Britten managed to make it to the final round.
The last task was to climb a rope of about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first person to complete this track in his time, thus becoming the first athlete to complete the challenging 4th stage of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldero won by finishing it three seconds earlier.
After this difficult win, Caldero spoke to E!News, shocked that he had won the $1 million grand prize.
"I think it's great to think about it, I've never made more than $10,000 a year or lived up to it," Isaac told E!.
I mean, it happened all of a sudden... I can't imagine what the future would be like... unpredictable.
Producer Kent Weed also met with The Hollywood Reporter in the final, explaining why no award would be given, even though Britten was the first contestant to finish the track.
According to the rules, money is given to the fastest.
Weed said, "If there's more than one finisher, the fastest one wins the prize."
Even though money is a great prize and life-changing, he has also won a huge jackpot.
I don't think he had a bad idea about it.
He's so happy he did what he did.
He received tons of praise from his fans.
He's a great man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said, "I'm glad it's Isaac if anyone's going to beat me."
I think if their roles had changed, Isaac would have thought the same thing.
The American Ninja Warrior renews its contract for the eighth season, and filming will begin in Spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season was not very pleasant for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best in baseball, the Tigers are now in the last place in the American Central League.
Reducing his game to disruption, the Tigers managed to beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday, making a perfect game.
The Twins lost their chance to advance to the American League Two wild card, surpassing the Houston Astros half point difference.
For Detroit, it was a return to the good game, which was rarely seen during the second half of the season, even for a night.
In the words of the Tigers manager Brad Ausmus, "all victories are pleasant in any way."
The Tigers' cannon-shooter, Alfredo Simon, was able to score one point in the sixth and ninth shots, showing Detroit's early offensive support with three points in the first two hits.
Simon (13-9) scored 6 3/1 shots in a row, three of which were running.
This was only the third quality start in the last nine rounds.
“I just want to close the year strong,” Simon said.
It’s hard to waste every game on the reserves, so I wanted to dive deeper into the game.
The Tigers' selected hitter, Victor Martinez, scored three hits and two were running, the first RBI to win since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-match night since he won four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He shook the stick tightly," Ausmus said.
He looked good (in shooting practice), he was already visibly better at BP, which he continued to do in the game.
By the end of the seventh round, the Twins had the best chance of getting back into the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton started the line by making doubles on the left-hand side.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks was only able to get a slow shot, and Simon caught second goalkeeper BrianDozier to swing for left-handed BlaineHardy before lifting.
Mauler, the only player in the two-run that could challenge right-winger Drew VerHagen, the striker Miguel Sano, boldly advanced.
With a pair of runners in the second tie-up run, VerHagen managed to draw third goalkeeper Trevor Plouffe into the duo game.
Plouffe's strike against the DP was the 27th in the big league this season.
After Detroit struggled to secure the ninth run, Maurer crossed the RBI and made a deal with the Tigers, making 5–4, closer to Bruce Rondon.
However, Sano was caught in three launches for the fifty-fifth rescue.
Detroit took advantage of the early exit of Phil Hughes, who had lost his form.
The Tigers won three runs in their first two shots against the experienced right-handed players who had been out of the field for more than a month due to back burns and had just come out of injury.
"This is not the match I really want to play," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable in the continuation and managed to make pretty good throws in the third shot."
When the first shot was successful, Hushes took second goalkeeper Ian Kinsler out of the game.
Right-winger J.D. Martinez was knocked out twice, leaving Victor Martinez alone in the first run of the match.
Victor Martinez competed with the runners to pass the 0-21 band in the scoring position.
Third goalkeeper Nick Castellanos followed with one shot to the right, winning another run, but Victor Martinez was kicked out when he wanted to make the third, so the threats were over.
The Tigers added in the second, earning an outer pair from catcher James McCann and a two-for-one from midfielder Anthony Gose, making the situation 3-0.
The Twins’ manager Paul Molitor said: “It was a big hit.
He didn't hit it very well, but he threw it in the right place.
The shooter Hughes scored three unpointed shots until he was replaced by the right-handed rescuer A.J. Achter.
Hughes was accused of three runs in six hits and four inaccurate hits.
Note: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was out of the game due to the pain on his shoulder he used to throw.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of cripples since mid-August due to shoulder pain, is scheduled to begin work on Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, the Twins will face the LHP with Daniel Norris DL.
The Tigers and Norris have been 1-1 in four games since David Price's transfer on July 30.
He hasn’t played since August 20 due to pain on the right side.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will compete with the Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open the economy to the world
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with managing the reforms that the economy needs to be more open to accelerate growth.
At the 16th Central Leading Group meeting to Strengthen General Reforms, the President said, "China should develop its opening policies by attracting foreign investment expertise."
While promoting opening up, Xi said new reforms would bring new energy and vitality, creating a new space for economic growth.
The leading group adopted a number of proposals, including a negative list regulating market access, relaxation in border control policies, encouraging state-owned organizations (SOE) to incorporate private capital, and a review of the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list of prohibited sectors and business branches for investment will be prepared.
The system will be tested step by step and improved with trial programs.
This is an important move, as it will play a larger role in allocating resources to the market and will make the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also loosen its control over companies, allowing them to run their own businesses.
China will also examine new models of cross-border economic co-operation in the border regions and introduce new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
More space will be available for private investment to open government-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment, and it will protect the interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services," the statement said.
In addition, the requirements for foreigners to obtain permanent residence permits or a “green card” will be optimised and the application process will be facilitated.
Guaranteeing the rights of lawyers to practice and training professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at the meeting.
According to a statement issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
Miniature bag is now very fashionable-Time Newspaper Friday Supplement
In the world of fashion, the roads turn around and come into bags.
The latest trends are those of miniature...
It can also be said that small bags attached to the older ones attract attention.
They say the little one is beautiful.
I think this applies to bags as well.
Almost unable to walk the streets with bags of the size of the suitcases, the wind suddenly began to blow in the opposite direction, and the bags tended to shrink.
We already had small bags, but this time they came up with the smaller size of the big sleeve bags.
These tiny bags can only fit your phone, credit card, and key.
The movement, which began with Céline and Hermès, spread with Prada.
The transformation of bag admiration into miniature curiosity has also affected the newly emerging models.
Loewe presented the fun bags in two sizes this season.
The most elephant-looking bags from Panda, polar bear and elephant-shaped bags stand out.
The mini sizes of the big bags offered by luxury brands with the phenomenon names again seem to attract the most red carpet celebrities.
Hermes' "Birkin" bag, dedicated to Jane Birkin, is one of the most preferred.
Although Jane Birkin said in a press release that she didn’t want her name to be mentioned with a purse, that’s how it’s now in her memory.
Fashion weeks have led to the massization of the mini-bag current.
On the podiums, mini bags are also prominent.
Because they're so small, it's unlikely you'll be able to put them on your arm.
They can be used with long straps.
But on the podiums, we saw those long straps wrapped around the wrists of the models.
Fendi is one of those who brings the mini-bag issue to the forefront.
He has a suggestion for those who can’t fit in a mini bag but can’t give up on them.
Mini bags for big bags.
How's that?
Turning mini bags into a bag ornament that can be attached to the big ones.
This presentation, which stands out on the podiums, has been quickly compensated on the street.
Let's see what else we can see!
Skin change in the denim
Turkey is at the level of competing with world brands on denim.
This experience in production is now enriched by design.
Loft is one of them.
We see that the black models, which were a few before, are now starting to take their place on the shelves every season.
In the season when blacks are so high, the denims have found their best friend.
Leather parts and leather detailed designs stand out as rebel-friendly of denims.
In general, short models with zippers called "motorbike" are on the agenda.
The strong air of the skin is also complemented by black pieces; chiffon long blouses, sparkling sweaters sport provides a stylish look.
Young people used to wear denim and want to get lost in the crowd.
It was thought to save the day.
Now young people want to carry a piece that emphasizes elegance as well as comfort.
From this point of view, it is possible to say that Loft has correctly understood the target audience with the collections and complementary parts prepared.
Small step for Banksy, big step for "global"
The world premiere of "The Art of Banksy" collection, which brings together the works of the mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The exhibition, which is the product of the artist’s 15-year work, and where 85 original works come together for the first time, is the first exhibition of the Global Karaköy building.
Mysterious street artist Bansky's first exhibition in Istanbul opened the day before in Global Karaköy (R<0xC4><0xB1>km<0xC4><0xB1>m Street).
The world-famous artist, who hid his identity and used a subordinate name, was, of course, not present at the opening.
We don't know if he came to Istanbul.
But the curator of the exhibition, Steve Lazaridas, says that Bansky is not even aware of the exhibition.
There is no need to ask her permission.
Because the old friends Bansky and Lazaridas parted ways after 12 years.
Some of the artifacts were collected from Lazaridas and some from collectors.
But there are things that Bansky followers are interested in.
What would Banksy think of the exhibition "The Art of Banksy", where 85 of his works were collected?
For example, how would he feel about entering the exhibition with a ticket ($35)? What would he say if he saw the small store created at the end of the 800-square-meter gallery area?
Would the Red Balloon Girl, Cleaner, Rose Now make a sound that her works were printed on cloth bags, wallets, necklaces, drawing attention to the wounds of the world?
The fact that the exhibition of an anarchist-spirited artist who hides his identity has become such a consumer material is a disappointment for Banksy's followers.
That's not Banksy's style.
Buy a limited number of tickets before you run out!
The big exhibition "The Art of Banksy" for the small, globalizing world can be seen until April.
They are wicked and wicked.
You should dig a ditch.
President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an continued his reaction to the academics who signed the declaration.
He said, "They are evil, they are evil."
Verily, those who are with the wrong-doers are wrong-doers.
He said, “They have committed the same crime because they were with those who committed the murders.”
Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, who left cloves in place of the explosion in Sultanahmet, said: "In this action on Sultanahmet Square, a place of peace that smells of history and civilization - especially near the German Fountain - I shared our sorrows over the death of 10 of our German friends in such an area, both with the German President and the German Chancellor.
I would like to extend my condolences to the German people, first of all, to the families of the dead.”
“Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination,” he said.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an, who continued to react to the academics who signed the declaration, said: "I condemn and strongly condemn the academics who stood up against all these terrorist incidents and issued a black declaration and signed under those massacres."
The fact that our people understand who is who much more closely, that is, being a professor and an associate professor in front of them does not make anyone an intellectual.
These are dark people.
These are the evildoers, and these are the vile.
They have committed the same crime because they were with those who committed the massacre.
What do you think will happen to those three-year-olds who are in the dark with their father?
How do they fit into their conscience to take a place next to his murderers?
I call on all judicial authorities and the senates of universities to take office because of these actions contrary to our constitution and laws.
Yesterday, I said that the steps that need to be taken must be taken quickly.
Whatever they do, they should be there.
Those who want to do politics should do politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in parliament, let them go and dig a ditch or climb a mountain.
I'm speaking so plainly and clearly.
TEOG Results Explained

“When I was looking for two wrestlers, I found 26 people.
Mete Gümürhan's second documentary "Young Pehlivans", 66.
The Berlin Film Festival (February 11-21) was the first Turkish documentary to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" section.
Gümürhan, who is originally from Edirne but has a production company in the Netherlands, told why and how he filmed the documentary he completed in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pehlivans", which tells the story of six Amasya boarding school students who aim to become world champions in wrestling, will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival.
Young Pehlivanlar, the first Turkish-made documentary selected for this episode, is one of the nominees for the Crystal Bear award.
Although he was born and raised in the Netherlands, he was originally a director of Edirne Mete Gümürhan.
When he was a child, he came to Turkey during the summer holidays and listened to his grandfather's oily wrestling stories and watched the competitions.
“There are no political problems in Turkey.”
I wanted to tell the world what else was going on in Anatolia.
"For example, wrestling from our ancestral sports is unfortunately not well known," he wants to meet with 6 directors and prepare a documentary project.
This project is unsuccessful, but one day the news of the magazine he read on the plane opens the door to another project.
We stayed at the sugar factory.
Mete Gümürhan, a 10-11-year-old wrestler who traces the writing about two younger brothers, goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
The father of the children won't allow the filming for the documentary.
She said: “I’ve been thinking about what I can do all day.
The support from the Ministry of Culture could be withdrawn.”
The father was talking about a boarding school in Amasya where the children would go.
I thought about going there.
While I was looking for two kids, I met 26 kids who were interested in wrestling at school.
We started filming in a week and ended the leave.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the sugar factory dormitory."
The filming was completed in three weeks and the language was the biggest challenge the filmmaker faced.
Gumürhan, who said that three different languages were spoken on the set where the foreign film director and voice actor worked, "I didn't know what to face when I was shooting."
“They don’t even know Turkish,” he said.
Young Pehlivans focuses on the story of six of the 26 children wrestlers.
Baran, who was raised by his grandfather and had a weight problem, was unable to attend the trainings because he broke his arm, Beytullah, who was ambitious but had health problems, Umit, the cute boy of the school, Ahmet, the youngest champion, and Mohammed, who held the group together.
Mete Gümürhan describes his work with children as follows: “I left them completely natural.”
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
For the first week and a half, I was in training.
I wanted the kids to pretend they didn't have a camera.
"Thankfully, they got used to it quickly."
It was a surprise to Berlin.
Mete Gümürhan, who said that he did not expect the young Pehlivans to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival, said, "We had preparations, but it was a surprise that we were elected to Berlin."
Young Pehlivans is not a sports documentary, it is a production that tells about the struggles of children and tells sections of their lives.
“I wanted to bring to the forefront the stories of children with family problems who are able to cope with their identities and problems,” she says.
Supporting academics from the art world
Following the announcement of the "Academics for Peace Initiative", the storm went as far as opening investigations and arrests on academics yesterday, while at the same time there are a series of support statements.
The first support came from literary figures, including many famous names.
Yesterday, the filmmakers announced their support for the theater.
In a statement signed by 138 theatricalists, "...we stand next to this honorary meeting of academics who call for peace as artists in the field of theatre and stage-performing arts and declare that we stand by freedom of expression, equality, the right to life and unconditional peace."
"With our conscience and our whole heart, we join our voices in calling for peace and negotiation by academics."
More than 400 filmmakers, including Deniz Türkali, Atilla <0xC3><0x96>zdemiro<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Nadir Sar<0xC4><0xB1>ba<0xC4><0x9F><0xC4><0xB1>cak, <0xC3><0x96>zcan Alper, Serra Y<0xC4><0xB1>lmaz, Onur Celebrity, Ye<0xC5><0x9F>im Ustao<0xC4><0x9F>lu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçelik, said, "We are on the side of free thought and art.
But without but without: "We will not be a part of this crime!"
We are on the side of the Academics Initiative for Peace," he supported the academics.
In a statement, the Association of Cinema Writers (SIYAD) said, “We are with the academics who have become the target of the Linc campaign.”
The Academicians for Peace Initiative called for peace and negotiations with simultaneous statements held in Ankara and Istanbul on January 11, and issued a statement titled "We are not partners in this crime".
The text was signed by 1,128 academics at 89 universities, as well as thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, who were world-renowned for their theories and books.
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an and Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu criticized the statement of academics as "supporting terrorism", calling for institutions to "do what they want".
Following this call, some universities fired academics, while the prosecutor's office launched a resen investigation.
A large number of academics were arrested yesterday.
I'm a fan, please help!
Hürrem Sultan's red hair, Beren's nose, Justin's hair...
While trying to look like celebrities is normal to some extent, it is seen as a psychological disorder from the moment it begins to affect life in its entirety.
The Celebrity Worship Syndrome, also known as Celebrity Worship Syndrome, is a newly discussed topic that has already become an academic topic in the world.
It can be normal to run to the hair salons with famous photos of ladies.
But we must not forget the year when all the adolescents walked around with Irish red hair.
In the aesthetic operations of 2015 that we left behind, it was already the news that the 'Beren nose' was the head.
On the men's side, it's no different.
For a time, it was customary to dress like Polat Alemdar.
Now the opposite wind is blowing.
Justin Bieber is full of guys.
So much so that the unnecessary information we quoted has been read thousands of times online: "First, when you go to the barbershop, cut the sides of your hair - above the ear and around the top of your head."
The sides alone will be short.
After the cutting process is over, you should shape your hair with light water.
Once you have finished forming, fix your hair with the help of spray.
"Justin must be styling when it's wet to get the hair."
All this has already become an academic topic in the world, and it brings to mind the newly spoken ‘Celebrity Worship Syndrome’, also known as the ‘Celebrity Worship Syndrome’.
Fans of celebrities are seen as love balls in us.
Artists boast of their number of fans and how much they have influenced them.
Fortunately, psychology doesn’t seem to be that simple.
It is especially debated that adolescents decide what to eat, drink, listen to, and wear according to celebrities.
Excessive attachment to names that are presented inaccessibly, role models are defined as mental disorders.
Sümeyye Demir, a specialist psychologist, admits that Turkey is left behind in the studies in this field.
However, he does not forget that families are gradually becoming conscious: “One of the main issues of psychology is that one is at peace with oneself, that one is at peace with one’s own identity.”
At first, it was not taken very seriously to fill the children's room with posters, to dress up as one.
That's changing now.
Parents feel the need to intervene.
"A passionate commitment to someone is a sign that something is wrong with a young man's life."
Fans on emotional roller coaster
The interest in celebrities is inexhaustible, provided you don't overdo it.
Not wanting to get married, being jealous of his wife, preferring his clothes, suggests paying attention to the signs such as Iron.
We are talking about famous people.
To be curious about them, to be interested in their lives, to some extent, is considered normal.
But in the opinion of the expert psychologist, young people who missed the scale are mostly: "When there are no names in the family or the surrounding area to represent the child in virtue, good behavior, that gap is definitely filled."
There are not always good examples.
"He's copying the negativity, kid."
When we consult on how to approach them, Sümeye Demir begins by reminding that the syndrome of passion for fame is seen more often in adolescence.
Given that adolescents may be insecure about themselves, the problem is more easily vaccinate.
We face young people who, on the one hand, complain about their families’ limitations, on the other hand, expect support and compassion: “We are forced to consider their emotional ups and downs.”
New research shows that they are challenged by changes in their brains.
"A young man on an emotional rollercoaster must be affectionately attached to a man, to be welcomed naturally, to be treated gently."
Behavior can be changed
Expert psychologist Sümeyye Demir reminds parents of their duty to overcome the syndrome of worship of the celebrity:
Recognize his emotional distress, make sure you calm down before going into the matter.
Never let it suppress your emotions.
Show respect for his admiration to promote independence.
Instead of blaming teaching, set a good example, discuss names that will be a role model for him.
Try to take the place of celebrities together in our daily lives.
It will help to read books about the real world of celebrities together.
Transform your communication into an adult form.
Keep in mind that addiction and motivation use the same pathways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity for change, accept them as they are.
Be sure to get expert support on the subject of fanfiction.
He who is angry and jealous admires.
At the heart of the famed worship syndrome is the need to hope and seek help from someone else.
Unhindered love is actually a call for help.
Unfortunately, it is not perceived that way.
Moreover, this problem is so widespread that it is impossible to limit it to a country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyao<0xC4><0x9F>lu points out that there are certain names that keep television busy in every country.
Syndrome is more manifested by attachment to these celebrities: "They are extraordinary."
The general majority does not have the means.
Those who have it don’t act like it.
Either because they didn't take it or because they didn't dare.
"But those who can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't
Those who are jealous or angry don’t really matter.
They both have deep admiration.
They make effortless money, they're on the agenda of the magazine.
Even knowing this is enough to increase the fanbase.
Another advice of specialist psychologist Sümeyye Demir is to question the reality of those lives at this point.
It should not be overlooked that artificial lives are at stake.
This is where the support of the environment comes into play for the person who is passionate about fame.
However, he insists on admitting that the celebrity he is a fan of has problems like himself.

Do I need to have a gall bladder surgery? - Family - Health News - Zaman Newspaper
Dr. Fevzi <0xC3><0x96>zgönül answers questions in the corner of the Meydan Newspaper.
I have stones in my gallbladder, and every morning when I wake up, I go to the bathroom with abdominal pain two or more times a day after meals.
Could this be preventing me from losing weight?
I'm starting to use alkaline right now, but I'm not losing any weight.
Ever since I was a kid.
What should I do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
Answer: Gallstone is often accompanied by an infection.
These abdominal pain complaints, which develop immediately after eating, are also a sign that when you eat, you contract the gallbladder and drain the inflamed gall into the intestines.
The intestines, which are disturbed by the inflamed bile, try to quickly expel this bile.
This is why you often go to the bathroom.
Because you often go to the bathroom, your food is thrown out without digestion and you are slow to lose weight.
I think you need to treat this condition.
If you go to a gastroenterologist and the condition is detected, you can get rid of it by using antibiotics.
But eventually you may also need to have gallbladder surgery.
Alkaline probiotics can reduce your complaints a little, but they don’t.
No matter what happens, continue to use the alkaline probiotic.
Because the biggest help for you to lose weight is this probiotic powder.
I eat a lot when I’m stressed.
When I'm stressed and nervous, I give myself to eating and gaining weight.
How do I deal with this?
ANSWER: The desire to overeat actually means that the energy needs are not fully met.
This may be due to having eaten little or bypassing breakfast and lunch.
Another reason is that you can’t digest the food you eat.
For this, your digestive system needs to work healthy.
If you don’t have an ulcer, a reflux or something like that, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic.
You will see a lot of benefit.
I can't lose weight, doctors don't know why
There is usually information in your corner that is aimed at slimming.
It makes a lot of sense to me, but my situation is a little different.
I can't gain any weight.
Most importantly, I don't know why.
The doctors say nothing.
ANSWER: Our techniques are not only aimed at slimming, but to restore the physiological functioning of the body to its ideal dimensions.
Fat and weakness are the same kind of disorders.
Losing weight in weight and not gaining weight in weakness are treated with the same technique.
When you eat sweets and pastries, you become even weaker.
I think you've figured that out by now.
You can also be stimulated with carboxypuncture and gain weight with a healthy diet.
So you’re weakening away from your ideal body.
Our other patients have also moved away from their ideal body fat.
You will reach your ideal body by gaining weight, and they will reach you by losing weight.
If the system problem goes away, you gain weight, and they lose weight.
First of all, the system needs to work properly.

A child who feels worthless is stuck in hate.
There are some feelings that are innate in the world of feeling.
Fear, sadness, happiness, confusion, anger, anxiety...
However, feelings of hatred, hatred, revenge appear in children over time and as a result of some wrong attitudes.
Every person needs to be an individual, including in childhood.
That is, whether the parent or social circle respects their decisions, their opinion on issues that concern them, and wants them to feel valued.
Providing them is the basis for building a healthy personality.
For example, actions such as deciding for the child (what to wear, what to eat) on issues that concern the child, ignoring the child’s wishes and insisting on their own truths (sending the child to the instrument course who wants to take a football course) do not respect the child’s personality.
Since the child who is not respected for his self and being loses his freedom to be himself, his defense mechanism unleashes a sense of anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because, in fact, anger and hatred are the opposite of acceptance," says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who says that the child hates and does not accept what is done to him and tries to tell him and his surroundings that he is valuable.
The fact that the child does not accept the situation and reacts in this way is a positive development in terms of personality development, the expert psychologist said, "The hatred here is 'me too' and serves the purpose of maintaining the child's self-esteem."
“If a child is allowed to be an individual, hatred disappears.”
The child seeks to protect himself by seeking refuge in anger and hatred
At a young age, in the most vulnerable times, both physically and spiritually, the parents of the children, the subject of verbal and emotional violence by their environment can cause negative emotions in the child, Arslan says that with neglect, the child will experience the feeling that his presence is unnoticed and invisible.
Arslan continues: "Sometimes it may be that their emotional needs are not met (not to care for their hair, not to hug and kiss, not to care for their school or other needs), and sometimes their physical needs (e.g., food, drink, shelter, school needs, etc.) are not met."
This is an attitude of cultivation that opens the door to anger and hatred.
Emotional and verbal violence includes insulting, insulting, insulting, reprimanding, giving unnecessary and severe punishments, feeling worthless, yelling.
These behaviors touch a deep place as they are directed towards the child’s personality.
"Either the child loses his self-respect by accepting these things and spends the rest of his life struggling with the feeling of being worthless, unworthy of being loved and inadequate, or he seeks to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred."

At least 20 dead, 15 injured - World News - Zaman Newspaper
In Ouagadougou, the capital of the West African country of Burkina Faso, at least 20 people were killed and 15 injured in a bombing and gunfire at a hotel popular with foreigners and the cafeteria next to it.
The attack was claimed by a local Maghreb group linked to al-Qaeda.
The militants have reportedly detained some hostages inside the 147-room Splendid Hotel.
The operation, which the security forces conducted at the hotel five hours after the attack, is ongoing.
There are explosions and violent gunshots coming from the building where no one was approached.
A partial fire at the hotel continues due to explosives.
It is not yet known how many people are held hostage inside.
The hotel was preferred by foreigners and UN officials in particular.
Robert Sangare, director of the Yalgado Ouedraogo Hospital, said 20 people were killed during the siege, 15 people were seriously injured by gunshot wounds, fearing an increase in the death toll.
In a coup attempt in Burkina Faso last September, the interim president was briefly detained.
Burkina Faso Prime Minister Paul Kaba Thieba announced his new cabinet three days ago, while President Roch Marc Christian Kabore also assumed the post of Minister of Defense.
Romania moves to transparency in electoral expenditures
A new bill is being drafted in Romania to determine the source of the money used in the elections and to impose an upper limit on spending.
The government wants the people and companies that sponsor politicians in the elections to make their money contributions more transparent.
The bill also stipulates that the “decision money” used in elections should be avoided.
In the bill, each party or individual must spend money on election propaganda through a bank account.
All money spent in this way will be more transparent and regularly controlled by Romanian Electoral Kumunca (AEP).
It is also planned to impose a higher spending limit on the project.

Attacks on journalists in Turkey become commonplace
Ahead of Prime Minister Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu's visit to London next week, 25 famous authors sent a joint letter to British Prime Minister Cameron.
PEN-member writers have asked Cameron to bring up the recession in freedom of the press and expression in Turkey in his meeting with Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu.
Britain's leading authors have sent a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron asking his counterpart Ahmet Davuto<0xC4><0x9F>lu to bring to the agenda the recession in Turkey over press and freedom of expression during a visit to London next week.
Twenty-five authors, including the presidents of the International Union of Writers (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, expressed serious concern about "unprecedented pressures on freedom of expression in Turkey".
Threats and physical attacks on journalists, authors and publishers have become commonplace; the attack on Hürriyet Newspaper offices, the raid and confiscation of Koza <0xC4><0xB0>pek Media Group as an example.
Famous British writers such as Tom Stoppard, Ali Smith, and Ian Rankin, as well as PEN-member writers, including Elif <0xC5><0x9E>afak, said in a letter that three journalists working for Vice News were arrested, other journalists were prosecuted, and arrests against journalists continued.
The authors said that the arrest of Can Dündar and Erdem Gül during the investigation phase in the case of MIT Trucks caused concerns. "It is vital that journalists in Turkey fulfill their primary duties in society, allow the public to be informed without limitation and without censorship," they said.
