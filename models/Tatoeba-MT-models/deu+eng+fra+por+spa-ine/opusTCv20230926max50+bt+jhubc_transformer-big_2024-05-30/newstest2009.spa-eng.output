The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions on ČEZ’s shares reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of Tuesday, immediately reacted to Monday's fall when it fell to roughly 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall of stocks on Wall Street.
Also here is expressed the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the financial sector secretary’s stabilization plan.
Decline of shares in Asia
Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although over the course of the day the index finally diminished part of the losses.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Stock Exchange index over its financial day scored nearly four percent, although it later attenuated its losses reducing the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index that follows Chinese stock movements on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell 3.8 percent, in Shanghai markets were closed.
The shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the Index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The planned rescue actions in the U.S. are unsafe and this influences the financial market around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Currency Office.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should re-meet as soon as possible, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the U.S. Assembly of Representatives rejected the aid plan to the financial system to which $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion crowns) should be devoted.
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks experienced a bloody bath and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index dropped to nearly seven percent, with a similar volume drop last recorded in 1987.
The index dropped before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the assembly’s proposal was not going forward, the index began to drop freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact on broad terms of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
Their vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers caused a gap in talks about the approval of the rescue plan in its form of aid to the U.S. financial system with the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must refine some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and be voted.
The aid plan for the financial system will be discussed Monday in the Assembly of Representatives.
He told Reuters on Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the Committee for Financial Services and the Banking of the Assembly.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, the "disenchantment" will be reached thanks to the complex mechanisms whose aid to the market will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a big breakthrough.
We resolve our disagreeing views as to how the package of measures to stabilize the market should be," Democrat Nancy Pelosiá told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday evening with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy unsold mortgage assets from financial companies that lead financial companies to severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are about to conclude the agreement on the plan, which will work and will also have to be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we’re already on it,” Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis explicitly impacts the rapidly falling stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing their utmost to make Congress finally approve a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors’ business in the Asian finance market as they are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now, there is nothing clear about when the two chambers of Congress will vote and, not even, whether they will not stagnate at the last moment with any problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be passed in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount destined to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as requested by President George Bush.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the program did not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of meetings
On the other hand, the president may veto this decision but Congress can overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to gain financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage bonds whose value dropped because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
“We’ve worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with Saturday’s advance and that he values “the endeavour of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy.”
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, head of negotiators, said lawmakers decided on the program’s money’s responsibility for taxpayers’ tax protection from their losses, a relieving closure of the scheduled finance plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the companies participating in the program, and create a committee that will have control over the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made a huge breakthrough in the direction of the agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also counts on helping homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree on the new mortgage payments it purchases in order to lower the monthly burdens of debtors’ deadline payments and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
“And that’s why we don’t know with what mechanism and at what price problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"More importantly, this week Congressmen agree on their support and give them their approval as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to reach that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing,” Marek said.
Armed Fight: The MP3 Player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile player plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to acquire only the reproductor.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and the demands of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern recorder to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LP records no longer come out, and as far as their quality is concerned, there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz, or blues music come into their shelves, you’re probably dreaming, at least, of these kinds of records.
This is the same with music that is on the way, that is, compressed, simplified music - music on MP3.
And here there are prices and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, just like for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try twenty crown market helmets.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life.
Some of the best players get a lot more than just playing music and even that which not even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most basic functions such as phoneing, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, you have a better or worse camera and you can even get to navigate.
And when we take the Smartphone and the PDAs into consideration, they will also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a small miracle since no fridge can make a grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display indicator will light up requesting recharge.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy tragons.
There are few mobile phones that can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, mostly much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly perform better.
Keep in mind that cheap phones will not play for more than two hours.
If, in addition to this, they constantly call themselves, for more safety, a charger for work - this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
With the MP3 player this problem is not going to have it, as even the worst hold at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem happens when recording music on your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, moreover, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, it is possible to record music directly onto the memory card but only on some unreductioned readers the small memory cards that are used on mobiles can be connected.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music through the computer USB.
Most mobile phones and players create their order in the music library alone according to the performer’s name, album title, genre, or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognise both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the cell phone knows more
For the choice of a specific equipment be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the convenience of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to the music as a background and you will listen to it every day just for a while, like in the tram, then you will be enough with any mobile you play.
What virtually any mobile truly gets.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile phone or player plays the music.
The MP3 will be played by everyone and, practically, almost all the music that reaches it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and with the exception of him the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The least includes the AAC format (format used by Apple and your iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
It is enough via the mobile internet to visit the relevant pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and purchase a song or album.
This service could by itself be a weighty argument for acquiring a music cell phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most are limited only to the short-success themes of the radios.
Neither are prices the lowest.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (either by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a mobile.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many music phones will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already purchase a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited to the absence of an entrance for classic earphones.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm inlet for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - really handles them anyone.
Minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous current cassettes or also to the recorders are evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that we mistakenly connect to the internet with the mobile and, consequently, gigantic account for data download.
Which apparatus to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g., the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card you will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
Basic models are usually only equipped with a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive ones have an 8GB memory.
If you already have a phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on capacity (maximum 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding music lovers, take hands on the most specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose walkman line phones have almost the same use as an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over 4,000 crowns, but with an increased memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand mentioned brings them MP3 players the most arries.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not going to be long before it arrives.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobile.cz.
The rest also confirmed the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of roaming fee regulation, it is likely to come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS that they send from abroad will be cheaper than if they send them from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competence that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, said that there is no longer a place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with their own network, it no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be quite difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still one possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a marked price drop to which the classical operators had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the UK market, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It has been shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
There is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to attract more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
Furthermore, after Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, is the owner of U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to concentrate on many more specific target groups.
Furthermore, in order for them to work effectively, they have a lot fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry relatively large expenses in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, these types of virtual operators are typically profiled at low cost – they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that, however, are often counteracted with the offering of more tight services.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers SMS at least half the cheapest compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a good hit as well the bet on a nothing trivial goal group.
This operator is specifically aimed at the man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator he likes and can be trusted,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works with this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept like that of Poland could hook up in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický said: “The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
Furthermore, from the point of view of the service offering is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in Czech Republic doesn’t seem too hopeful.
Rather, it’s about the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,” said Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a telephone conversation with mobil.cz.
Indirectly he assured that current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not lean to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition arises.
Interest in launching a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real Telefónica O2 competitor in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed phone services but also mobile phone services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have succeeded in advancing the meetings,” group spokesman Pavel Kaidl said.
Then, maybe they flash better times.
It appears that, for informal information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now his appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
“Right now, we believe that the situation is ideal for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with some complex and serious project in this field,” Vlastimil Sršeň, spokesman for Telefónica O2, told mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market refers to other operators.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not recorded any viable commercial project that, bilaterally profitable, can continue to develop."
“In the T-Mobile network, it will be difficult to find a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this time we should already have on the table some specific contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting the requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this as regards spending and infrastructure sharing.
We consider it to be the biggest contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to set up a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a price drop and thereby a decrease in profits.
So why make it easier to enter the competition?
When traders want to get something, they are able to pull the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on ČTÚ was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is attested to public information accessible on the ČTÚ websites.
But precisely now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: “In addition, the competitive environment in the mobile market has not long been open to a fourth operator.
With regard to the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would entail great requirements for him and, above all, for his services."
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Procurement (ÚOHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance to this problem.
“A virtual operator’s entry into the mobile market would be possible after a contract on renting the necessary infrastructure between a mobile operator and a virtual operator was closed.
Until today no agreement has been concluded as the offer of the potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for the classic operators,” added Kristián Chalupa, of the UOHS Department of Foreign Affairs.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For offices that must represent the interests of consumers, it is more than a consideration, but they should note that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: “Abroad where virtual operators operate normally, we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the price drop of mobile services.”
Obviously, pressure as to the proper functioning of the market media and the price drop do not fall within the interest of the UOHS.
Really how dramatically shocking this whole case is is in the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline at the gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a hard struggle for competition.
“The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this regard and has therefore no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore, have no corresponding rise in liability in their market operations.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators,” Chalupa added.
Interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many conflicting points.
There is obviously an analysis of relevant markets drawn up by ČTÚ according to which telecommunications are a single market from the point of view of the commercial tender.
In this type of market, of course, none of the Czech traders have a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision – for a virtual operator to emerge, agreement with the network administrator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for UOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators rise strikingly similarly.
Current complaints from stakeholders (including the aforementioned GTS Novera) show that in all negotiations with operators they clash with many similar obstacles.
Charging responsibility in the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the UOHS washes hands on all this matter.
We have met him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law for the expansion of the ČTÚ competition in the field of commercial tenders was introduced recently, which was not carried out, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
This should be well known to the UOHS representatives, but it is obvious that their interests are elsewhere.
Everything goes well, when nobody looks
At the same time, it unnoticedly continues to work something like a pseudovirtual operator that in the Czech mobile phone networks already exists a few.
These are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services that, however, only a part are public.
These are typically companies that engage in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a few chosen companies get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same by ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that trading conditions in all Czech mobile phone operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases such as the ones cited were discovered, we could talk about breach of contractual terms that could translate to the end of collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrová responded to the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would not reach responsible people.
Precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they earn profits that are not despicable and, at the same time - unlike real virtual traders - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible so much percent of customers.
They must also accept that your phone’s SIM card is not in your name so they can’t absolutely dispose of it as a normal customer of the carriers.”
This is precisely what should seem to the ČTÚ minimally strange.
There is also a new question for UOHS.
If mobile operators surround their eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this type of activities and if it is not willing it should not be content with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this story and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As it was already clear in the text, the virtual operator’s entry into the mobile phone market brought a significant decline in services prices.
At the same time, in virtually every country where the virtual operator emerged, the classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this break-up.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with service quality, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have intervened at this time and in none of the cases defended operators but their customers.
Whether it was with formal measures or informal pressure they managed the first virtual operator to emerge and with it others began to emerge.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all of this case happens as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot fail to be impressed by the confusion of attributes in these cases.
But let's not despair.
If this backstage information is correct and the virtual operator actually gets to these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market will likely start moving again.
If one of the carriers lets any virtual mobile operator in, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling it more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the day of official Czech celebrations presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, my home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one to male voice and one to female voice, one with choir and another instrumental.
The song is held by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek regards this national Czech song as one of the most beautiful anthems.
The Czech Radio has previously said that it has intentionally chosen Solos singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
“From the beginning, I have tried with both of them and then, too, with the Choir to fix themselves in the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it was consistent,” he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
It gained popularity and people made it theirs.
The first strofe of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The Prague MHD takes us Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company wrote the date on which the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets rather than a paper ticket.
This can now be purchased by nearly a hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it onto their chip card at the infocenters and transportation stations of the company at the stations of Metro, Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztýly, Letýňaly.
The bonds can be purchased from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a way of trading can definitely start to forget about ticket sales at the metro stations, where until now they had to regularly line up to get a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the thirteen subsidiaries of the Municipal Library.
“In these places there is a window with prepared staff at the disposal of passengers that helps interested parties with the purchase via the internet and also with the recharge of the voucher purchased on their card,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard on the automated vending machines that are located in some metro halls.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket picking machine and travellers will probably already have seen them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Budějovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five in the city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný concluded.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
Using the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter in it the Opencard chip card and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
In other words, in the circle trains and bus lines from numbers 300 to 499 that mostly use the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
“In the trains attached to the integrated transportation of Prague there are checkers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the bond zone,” said Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which sets the schedules for the collective transportation of Prague.
Circuit buses have their reading cards mounted in the driver’s box office.
When entering, it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany him with the Opencard in the intended place on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonuses, there is nothing easier than requesting the driver for this information,” Drápal said.
Passengers who do not travel on riding buses and do not remember when the voucher’s validity ends, can go to the vending machines where cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the US in a referendum
The German Sudetes asked in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is drawn from the letter that is kept in the collection of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this wish, presumably, some groups of Sudet Germans addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
It follows from the letters that are kept in a particular archive and that are now kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Český Krumlov Germans request in a letter to the US President not to allow the return of the "Sumava land" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that the American units are arriving on German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter, signed with a “people carrying Šumava’s fate in their hearts.”
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the Southeast Germans presumably assumes - according to them the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors beg in the letter to the American President to assume today and forever Šumava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants we are handed over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and at all collaborates with the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason the authors cannot sign is presumably fear of retaliation from the "Czech oppressors."
If the President of the United States presumably doubted this idea of the Shumavo Germans, it would be enough to hold a referendum in the Shumavo lands about whether their inhabitants want to be part of the United States or live under their patronage.
Even though the text of the letter, with the current knowledge we have of post-war history, may sound a little childish to us, according to some experts closely paints the expectations of the southeastern Germans of then.
Although the Czech Germans had to intuition minimally that it was to be dealt with about their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudets some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
This was in the war, as German from Budějovice, wrapped in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war the British arrested him and placed him in the Holstein prison camp dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they came home, the Czech would be good for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, were expected to be removed from the Republic on the basis of the Benes Decrees.
You don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way you could characterize the emotional Campaign that the Ministry of Transport decided to launch on Wednesday in the media.
The minister’s office, Aleš <0xC5><0x98>ebíček, promises to deter drivers from hazardous conduct at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be felt on television, radio, cinema, the internet and in brochures.
It would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol in the wheel.
And also to remind them to tie up the belts before getting started.
It wants to become aware especially of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and lastly also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Basically human stories that embed emotions.
And this is what we are witnessed by the "bloody" advertisements throughout the campaign:
You don't think - pay!
The word "you don't think" is written in big letters on the license plate.
And in a pond of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that a man at a time of lapse can come to pay with his own life.
The ads are going to "frighten" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign carried out in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises that this way it will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, he spends a red light and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Kořán.
And that’s why an information campaign in the press and mainly negative advertising is necessary, the psychologist specifically.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert will return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
Israel’s provisional government president Ehud Olmert ruled on the restitution of virtually all occupied lands in 1967, i.e. the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we will necessarily have to restore almost all (occupied) land if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“I’m sure we will stay with some percent of these lands, but to the Palestinians we owe a similar percent because without this there will be no peace,” he said.
He admitted that in case of restitution, East Jerusalem would also be included.
“Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and therefore doesn’t want tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a portion of Jerusalem,” Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, sacred and historic place" that lies inside the ancient city.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This won’t work,” he insisted later.
Removal from the Golan Heights
Olmert also voted for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also entail concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of the Golan withdrawal," he said.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to break off to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with the Hezbollah (Chita movement), they will have to break from the ongoing support that the terrorism of Hamas (Chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq provokes.”
Question after the accident: Are stewardesses on buses illegal?
The law is unknown, you can’t walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic bus crash of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises whether stewardess and passengers can move around the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the stewardess's activity is opposed to the road traffic law," said Transportation Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old stewardess died last week was obviously caused by the truck driver only when the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having booked two other places.
However, the bus may have an accident or suddenly brake, and at the exact moment the steward distributes the coffee or newspapers.
Here what the role plays is whether the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with foot spots.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no footsteps, which the company’s director, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
“We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the toilet while the bus is running if they have a seat.”
The housekeeper doesn't know the law.
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the stewardess' role - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Even no legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The road transportation law only knows the term of Auditor of vehicles, whose rights and obligations are not defined,” said spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic at the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, on the contrary, thinks that the law sufficiently addresses this issue.
“It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have foot sites.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided between urban, where there are places to stand and maximum speed limited, interurban with places to stand with a higher speed permit and those of long distances without places to go, with the highest speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, the expert says.
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP’s expert on Transportation Safety, sees no major problems with the movement of the steward on the bus.
"During the development of the journey there is not much danger threat, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
Not even here is the assurance that the turbulences will arrive and that the stewardess can be hit in the head."
“However, if the bus suddenly obviously brakes, physical laws are valid.
Same as in a city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewardess must be solved by the internal rules of the carrier," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier offering stewardess service.
Use in it two hundred.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work risky.
“However, as soon as I have the impression that the stewardess position is risky, then I’ll delete it.
The coffee and newspapers can receive it, passengers, upon entering.
It would save even expenses,” he says.
In interest to safety is why Asiana lacks stewardesses in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have stewardess, we’re against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a deadly accident,” he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
An enormous tragedy happened.
In the crash of the line linking Naples, a young stewardess from Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years died.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the flashes.
His driver tried in a fast maneuver to avoid it, however, hit the front right.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the stewardess' rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on compensation for the girl's family but expects the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring more accuracy about the stewardess’ movement on the bus, on which 30 experts from a group of the Ministry of Transportation have been working for a year.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They are not too devoted to buses, but rather to the pointing system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile while on the road,” says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider stewardess activity to be a significant threat to the safety of passengers," spokesman Hanzelka said, concluding that bus safety control is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf’s hope is supported in Frankfurt
The letter from the board of directors of the West LB bank to its collaborators does not lack great words.
By the merger of the Dusseldorf bank units with the DEKA bank, a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group can be formed, as the letter says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the ‘competition block’ with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a starting point for subsequent mergers in the field of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to understand, when a board of directors wants to show ability to act in tough times.
Because just like before the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also of the federal financial services surveillance institute that has recently made it clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the part of Frankfurt, a lot is being spoken about such a union between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse customers know about by its investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year in late August, said he sees no sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Straße, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which now consists of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board to begin negotiations with West LB on common trade activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
This is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the area of Sparkassen the name of the bank DEKA, which with its 3,000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs at the financial site Frankfurt.
In 2003, the situation seemed so that DEKA could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government expressed itself against Helaba’s involvement in this project.
The other two banks did not find the same language either.
Instead, the regional bank of Rhineland-Palatinate began dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the chairman of the board of directors of the Helaba, expressed that he was against coexistence plans with his bank.
Independently of this, it seems more clear that the union of the different banks in the public law sphere is necessary.
When the Bavarian parliament elections are going to pass, the union of the BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg could make progress.
For Iceland that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge, Helaba will be missing partners to achieve that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it exceled much better from the financial crisis than the real estate in Stuttgart and Munich did.
The Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Thuringia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, avoided coexistence plans with the West LB earlier this year.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form only one part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro- Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that is naturally not the desire of the bank itself.
Thus, also in the letter from the bank’s board of directors it is stated that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As the coexistence between single parts of the bank can be matched with the DEKA, that will show the time.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as “the weekend of the Italians”
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca it is the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena assists him as his girlfriend, and that’s why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5 litre barrel of Kaiser branded beer is built a huge bear tiger showing nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that bass sounds know how to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a kiss, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, this evening at 23:45 three buses leave, ` direction Munich, the beer party', predictable arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are planned mainly for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
On one of the corners of the car park next to their flag are the South Americans singing, they had already started to celebrate at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-colored legs, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have come to the Oktoberfest, considering that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the road there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the return.
Spending overnight there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of the purity of Bavaria, illness insurance and the guide in German- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly the tranquility reigns on the bus, travelers are sleeping.
It's okay, they'll still need the strength.
They stop to Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with the Italian license plate make another pause on the 8 motorway just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group arrives at 6.30 in the morning at the parking lot next to Teresa’s Prado, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, wear a yellow hat.
There, on the left is written "Oktoberfest", next in Gothic letter is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When the doors of the tent of the campaign are opened, that means marching!” shouts Marco in the morning.
"March!" March and occupy the back sites in the campaign tent.
"Don't take the places ahead, because we're going to block, and everyone with yellow caps doesn't sit on the same bench, spread across the space!"
A liter of beer, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
Only he leaves his place, he'll be occupied!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone goes to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps on the trees, traffic signs and even on a sign of the elections of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
One wishes to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of the Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no accurate data on the number of people; it’s about 50,000 people traveling over the Alps and stormfully entering the tents, 10 percent of all came especially from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police receive assistance from seven police officers in the Bolzano Autonomous Province, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assists) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favourite tent of the Italian campaign is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück said last week.
Well, the politician would use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich’s real estate financier, which is listed on the DAX index, receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to be able to resist turmoil in the market.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to €35 billion.
The share of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
The money comes from private banks as well as from those of public law.
The cause of this is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to a report, state financers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a brief period—which now, due to distrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year, the bank’s cash equity reserve fell by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, and the share of equity delayed somewhat from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, ongoing revenues from financial investments and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero, debtor imputation revenues and some securities also those of the dissolution of provisions from credit businesses tended to decline by more than 70 percent, at 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and large income from reimbursements of the expenses of compensation for the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the organized businesses for the consortium’s companies, the negative balance could blame a deficit with about 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990, the former state financeer was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as the reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be earned from the funding of state projects, the Defa began to devote itself intensively to infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and was diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have an "essential material effect" on the group's consolidated profit and loss account, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that the dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007 they were cancelled to two-thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financial in the area of infrastructure.
Since the bank does not own customer deposits, it turns out, compared to other banks, to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans dropped essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for the group’s financing for a brief time and the company is assured of “the influence of the international currency markets that are now essentially unfit to operate.”
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Financial Services Surveillance Institute (BaFin) start from the basis that the Hypo Real Estate Group’s competitiveness from now on is secured.
That is what the shareholders and creditors of the bank have to wait for.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis, there is no evidence.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
However, the other case cannot be excluded.
The voice was that at the last hour of Sunday the bank was still nearly insolvent, so temporary salvation cannot at least reassure people worried about it.
The stock price dropped to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
The loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, loan courses according to the position in the property registry clearly tend to fall.
This is mainly affected by the loans of the former Württemberg subsidiary Hypo and with reason the loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are unhealthy are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start with pension amortization on time.
Or something is going to happen, which you don’t risk imagining anyone—the financial crisis is going to overcome in the next 15 months.
But seeing the cross news about partial statization, now security that is already at its limits has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend nights sleepless, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Still short-term investors can put the end point and use the new-account transport of losses for upcoming payments of benefit compensation taxes on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop had to show up at Tachibana High School the girls started laughing: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on the exchanges she tells Japan.
“The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and go by train 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, luckily I didn’t miss.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
From eight o’clock in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the ‘home room’.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
In addition, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform, I put on an old skirt from my host family’s mother and a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself at the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this time I was very happy because I had already started studying this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have squirted, laughed and signed and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, linda"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked many questions – at the same time it was very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then in the recreation all took out their Blessings.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something other than boring pieces of German bread.
It had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and something like tofu meat.
In most cases, I have no idea what to do here in Japan.
Things are weird and have a new taste.
What is sure is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of plums marinated in salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools the benedicts are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a blessed done in a very artistic mode for a boy and gives it to him in hopes of being able to know him better during a recreation.
I read about that in my Manga-Comics.
I am very curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why exactly Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because I'm fascinated."
I’ve preferred to read Mangas for years.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely sure that one day I will travel there.
Also because I have a weakness for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here although Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
A rat or cockroach feeling the danger is said to flee, why is it also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can one control whether they, behaving in the way we are, feel the same?
In an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the selected answers to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else able to prove it so far, although we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case at least we can expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we devote ourselves to other species and include the questions about sensation and generally about consciousness, we enter the unknown sphere because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as the other animals: it becomes the dead, flees, or attacks.
People behave in a similar manner, from which some scientists make conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to infect our subjective experience with that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated with human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (due to their involvement in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be absolutely missing in other creatures.
Considering at least the aspects of our consciousness that depends on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from other primates.
Another particularity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is linked to the language, often that means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as anyone, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed by our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the consenting experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
The processes of animal consciousness could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, the essential thing goes rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for the formation of visualization.
And what results from that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain that is responsible for it is activated, as is the case with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when brain activity occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
From this point of view the sensations are highly attached to the part of the cerebral cortex that distinguishes primates and above all man.
From the point of view of the linguistic nature follow classifications of fine sensations because we can differentiate and classify states with the aid of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for the body feelings and the brain trunk, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can be referred to absolutely different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel like fear, possibly that feels likewise in two cases: But how can one control whether rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, well because she's afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches, on the contrary, do not have at least one brain.
Is the brain trunk responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to try it for men: How can you try it in the case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally different from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and tongue).
In any case, progress in neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured in rats and men.
Since I don’t investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward than working permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the alternate prime minister, said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as the confidence test of Ukraine's ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“But that’s not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is a lot to do in both countries.”
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
Now we have to do work at high speed,” said Ukrainian association president Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will not take our eyes off."
In Poland, a more radical step was agreed.
After numerous scandals, the Poland Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
In a letter we assured UEFA President Platini that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that.
Only in the last season many first division clubs were convicted because of manipulation down to the lower category, eventually also the division council had to be postponed.
Angry Dennis Quaid's Counter Attack
She wanted to promote a new movie, she spoke in an interview about private life- and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan designated her ex-husband as an adulter.
He gets angry and counter-attacks.
The late Two-Roses War on Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-couple: eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with U.S. magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - it tells a story of a marriage's failure.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard of how many times Meg tells the story of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old told New York Daily News.
Among other things, it’s very “sad” that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again “remember in public the pain and changes, all that a divorce means for a child.”
While Ryan after divorce lives alone, Quaid is married again and recently became a twin father.
And thus ends his statements highlighting: “Whatever my life continues.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that’s okay.”
Prices of airline and hotel tickets are falling
In the first half of 2008, airline tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany were made cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and hotel overnight stays were once again made cheap - this is the result of a study by American Express's travel and financial services provider.
The company has analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the rise in prices in the first quarter it found a major change in the second half.
After for many years hotel market prices continued to rise, overnight stays at many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe rose on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June, prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause of “the interests of American tourists in travelling decreased.”
The decline in hotel prices is also noticeable much more in financial centers such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial hubs such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter airline ticket prices also showed upward trends:
Due to the rise in cherosenum prices, Economy class travellers had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for plane tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, dropped on average to 12.5 percent, but changes in prices for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February, prices rose to 11.9, while in the second half rose to 23.6 percent.
According to a study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even dropped by half.
The cause of price change is, on the one hand, the rise in the loose economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the aircraft travel market demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the U.S. and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of flights from non-profit distances at airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the SV of Hamburg becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him does not yet go out to score the eleventh goal.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
The Gladbach player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly by reacting to what happened, he could read it clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," whispered Hermann Rieger at the entrance of the Hamburg Stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of the present were back in their places.
Rieger was an HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades, enjoying a very great reputation as one of those who made up a part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol raised his fingers in sign of assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, the main coach of Hamburg.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not accomplished.
"Today it wasn't all nice to see," added Marcell Jansen later.
Also Bastian Reinhard had desired to have him "more relaxed".
Result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) for his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show full strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," Martin Jol said.
On Monday, the Hamburg SV will be 121 years old.
On Saturday the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to interpret it,” said Marcell Jansen.
It predicts that the partial scores in the table correspond more to the league's veility than to the dominance of its HSV.
The kipo with their late forced players like Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric as well as Jansen who was taken away from FC Bayern need time to come together, but the kipo still cannot shine with their successes.
“We need more of feeling and dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the defeat of the vote
The fear spreads on Wall Street.
Early news of the banks’ rescue package failure dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest loss of points for one day in his history.

The salvation plan plans to make available resources to buy so-called "poor" mortgage stocks.
But the sum is going to be paid by blow but step by step.
As compensation for this, the state has to receive share option receipts for financial associations that during course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state’s cash.
Equity rates in Europe and the U.S. continue to decline
Billion aids for banks in Europe and the U.S. do not reassure investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate drops and negatively influences the Dax.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mystery phenomenon has caused researchers to be confused: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity may not be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
Because fuel pipes are now icing, it threatens death in the cold.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example Earth.
This allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick just as did the Sun Ulysses probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected according to the venerable law of gravity.
Rather, they frequent speed irregularities.
Suddenly the probes have greater or lower speed.
Physicists could not explain this effect until now.
It was called the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what astronomers remained in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter that may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
The universe’s researchers have known the existence of Dark Matter only for ten years.
It allegedly possesses the force of attraction and its influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible, meaning it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, Dark Matter makes up at least a fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, abducted tourists in Egypt must be released.
Sudan’s kidnappers had demanded millions of the rescue.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during the release.
Five Germans are kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the attention of the kidnappers.
The newspaper WELT ONLINE tells about the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
The same information is presented by the state Egyptian television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After news of the release on Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24, Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"We now control their health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are well and are in security, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the desert expedition are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting before the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue,” the guard said.
It was just about “receiving the hostages” when suddenly “this surprise” came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and two of them detained in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to hand over the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of his safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after they have received the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Abuse of stepfather "leads to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after he admitted eight charges of indecent assaults.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inquiry study, learned that he had regularly tied up his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession paper: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Mrs. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley in Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her up and bandage her eyes before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse she had been inflicted twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs Rande had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now looked "emotionally dead," as if she had "renounced life."
In April 2007, his real father, Randle Terrace, found the woman dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes saying, “I used to tie her up and open her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim must have been a frightening experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even more clearly, if she hadn’t done so, the matter probably wouldn’t have ended in court.”
“I noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie’s father and mother the abuse had on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future.”
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a work trip by the Ministry of Defense, abandoned two highly classified documents on the train for Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to police.
This is certainly the less serious charge under the law and does not indicate the intention to commit a crime.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the safeguard of information.
The Royal Law Service noted that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Secret Services Committee.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret place.
Construction companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the rescue/rescue of Bradford and Bingley banks.
The government, indeed, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The CEO of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers it “humiliating” that societies and their members have to pay.
Eventually, the 14 trillion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest earned in the meantime is assumed to be charged annually to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called today to pay the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will have the need to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Mr. Cole added.
Interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of payable interest, which can be nearly twice as much.
As building societies are mutual organizations and no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, whether through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises by five pence per liter
The inhabitants of Jersey will have to pay more for their milk.
The dairy newspaper Jersey Dairy has announced that the higher price of dairy products will increase by an extra five penny a liter from next Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February and subsequently investigations carried out by a consulting company.
Traders can decide for themselves if they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had risen before February was in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail on release
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the application for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she may be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His advocates said the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of several accusations of corruption in his charge.
Its long-tempo political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country’s militarily supported government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given probation to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is unclear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the petition for bail release for Sheikh Hasina, arguing that he could not get bail release because he was already on treatment abroad under probation," his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We're going to appeal the order of the Supreme Court."
Her advocates argued that she needed bail-free to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to his homeland after October 17, according to an Awami League leader on Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the provisional government, backed by the army, took power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both reject all charges they are accused of.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan, the UN says, have failed to take advantage of a recent vaccination campaign against polio because of the violence by the Taliban.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination program in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A UN spokesman said it happened despite Taliban promises that they would not have attacked or hampered thousands of officials while carrying out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge at ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission following the decision that compelled the company to reduce its stake in rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Competition Appeals Court that it will have to reduce its share in ITV by 17.9% below 7.5%.
The Commission previously stated that BSkyB’s interests hamper competition and allow its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV's stake raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin chief Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB said the force to reduce its package on ITV was unreasonable and was a disproportionate remedy, particularly why, BSkyB said, it would have surrendered its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special attorney to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fear that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials questioned during the investigation lied to the investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
"Severe allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. lawyers were removed from their posts by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But it was later learned that the lawyers had not been evaluated worse than others of their colleagues, and many observers concluded that layoffs would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
and may be dismissed at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The succeeding head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure from the layoffs, renounced his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for the layoffs, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic of Meat Loaf of Much Honour
The rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honored at the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony to be held in London, said obtaining this recognition would be "an honor."
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are carrying the nominations for this year’s awards and making the rankings of all four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability like the one used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the United Kingdom in 1979 and became number 15 in the ranking.
However, Bat Out Of Hell from Meat Loaf remained in the rankings for about nine years and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later appeared that he had a cyst on his vocal string.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply of service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of Primera Street – before I found Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active lane.
There's no sign.
It is virtually impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has fans.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primera Street.
that wants to repay Extra Place and create a clean hallway to the shops and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other fans include old neighbors who said they were enchanted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remains of the block’s past before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Preservation and Development of the city, which controls the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Vencidity Community Committee for Land Use held this month, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to stay in the city, asked for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, district manager of the Community No. 3 said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as a coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street emerged for the first time during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area," he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Conservation Committee, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe it got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large property was divided among his sons and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the establishment's photography coming out on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves, strings."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the East Village bourgeoisie, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest they may be, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a streak of the city that should be protected.
Jeremias Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk about the city's history on Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a slightly narrow, dead-end alley, dark also by daytime and marked by rust-iron warehouse doors and counter-windows, with old weekly newspapers blown along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat ran through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and which now hosts a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty 22-oz bottle of beer were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested that they could be given a cleanup.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet, and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ positions on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Effectively calling Hispanic voters is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very certain consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “bilingual transitional education” for English-students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which he prefers in classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern Los Angeles County region.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income family:
More than one-third of the students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively evaluated in the 2008 mathematics exam.
and almost equally amazing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than that favored by Mr. Obama.
The Sixth Street school emphasizes review and practice, constant evaluation of competences and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Also, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the chief of the Sixth Street, the school’s approach to teaching English to students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the processing of the contents of the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this one who has arrived from Mexico and that if you enter the classroom 12 months later you wouldn't be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model of replicating by other schools with large populations of Hispano-English pupils?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the response, but the idea of its party’s politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their very constant support for dark bilingual education the prediction of Mr. Obama’s response.
While immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by leaving people to stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
And instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the well-working education models rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil prices drop sharply after renewed economic fears
Oil prices dropped dramatically on Monday because of concern that the U.S. rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to revive the economy.
Crude oil stocks declined by 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before retreating, once again, because of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety seized investors, once again, on Monday, despite Congressional leaders saying they had reached an agreement over the weekend on the bailout plan, the biggest in history.
The news was shadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from ending.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, according to the government said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said on the frenzied weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal "seem to have not been able to reactivate the market sentiment."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The prospects for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates are going to be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
“We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is the assessment of whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
The bank’s analysts have lowered its expectations for next year, as oil consumption falls due to the economic growth crisis and the oil and gas price reduction forecast is 20 percent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: Team sets record
After spending, for the last eight seasons, longer in Jets uniform than anyone else, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw things going on in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned an unnotated game into a game of deflating.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazyly under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles achieving a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect prediction for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between players had a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the quarter, one of these when one cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that were going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing on the dam, the Cardinals' defense abused quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to fail by Warner.
In the last turnover, the faults bound by Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely gave him a 20-yard kick to win a final 34-0.
These are the highest points the Jets never made in a room.
To team coach Eric Mangini, he asked to describe the madness of this moment, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can say I liked the second quarter much more than the terzero.
They’ve earned a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Restless Gebrselassie leads world record
Again, Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has proven because many consider him the biggest runner in history, beating his own world record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person able to race the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
Following the victory in the pleasant plain race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has broken by 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, scored last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in an impressive-length race so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from counterclock racing to marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution will exacerbate his problems with asthma.
Instead, he planned to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing on average a cutting 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had lost a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension left it fresh, not rust.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I painted some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the African-Eastern rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating his careers too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on pacemakers as if it were a racetrack, and placing the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s abilities as a runner.
On Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began challenging Gebrselassie after their pacemaker decreased.
But shortly before three miles from the goal, Gebrselassie took a last momentum to separate from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for nearly five minutes.
Kamathi reached third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She also took part in the Beijing Games so it was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her best-record staff in nearly five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a smart calculation race, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners do head and then recovering them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, the pride and the trials of colored life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, is a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience become very evident.
Eatonville, the first fully black-inhabited city incorporated into the country and childhood place of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of color, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it is a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous Harlem Renaissance writer.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage by including it in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the Depression Season – remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, dignified and private as it was in the '30s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural negroes in Florida often resist sharing their true ideas with the white man, who "knows so little about us and doesn't know what's going to be missed."
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to start a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
“We are very cautious about how our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It has to be correct."
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living under a level of poverty double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the black south - sometimes despised, others praised - that was born from slavery in America.
It is no wonder if those who live here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep dialect books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road running through central Florida often forgotten into the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a cement face in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the store owned by Eatonville’s first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern Maron public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the widow Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston puts Eatonville in relation to the self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it whatever it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Mrs. Hurston immortalized by quoting men who were singing colorless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a vivid eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides herself on dressing with dignity.
Most residents remained fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” continues Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, swinging in his chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer printed.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the '20s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no large commemorative ceremonies, no large public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a 2003 biography of Mrs. Hurston.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street of the labour community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to him relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixture brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys went around the city throwing oranges and every thing against the people who were sitting next door,” Mr. Franklin said.
"They also killed a girl once.
They threw him at a watermelon in the car."
In a 1955 letter to Ms. Hurston wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted rather than honoring my race."
Residents say today that the disintegration of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of its young people.
"Black kids were used to being hugged - I remember this - they used to hug the teacher in the morning and evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and CEO Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't going to hug your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who passed over prejudices, just like she did, with buzz, confidence and lines like: “How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of Mrs. Hurston and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing her into American canons.
The road project came right at the moment Eatonville’s most famous daughter was under the reflectors again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the five-way road would have been to put in what you would call curvature speed, a true civic pride," Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People from outside the city like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church from here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historic Register in 1998.
A new library (bearing the name Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a replenished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like on a street of the past under a summer rain, in a town as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of the history of Eatonville, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A preliminary permission is required to do most interviews, and some things - such as murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a brave and convinced teacher who has a weakness because of the bright red, still fear that their island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw her whole race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and equally the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go here, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at their story, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York, everyone talks about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not notice that they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the bee-nested offices standing above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopoly New York face daily the worst "office bad day" since the 1929 downhill.
Boys for home delivery continue to make their metal carts for tea resonate across the sidewalks and carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between charged apartment buildings, like human mules, with 50 eccentric print shirts hanging on a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in queue for their morning take-away food, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon on working days.
Employees still wait in queue for their bagel to the seller’s carts, and yet it’s impossible to find a taxi between four and five o’clock in the afternoon on the days of the week.
It seemed to me that there was no crisis at all, until this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time it took for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase subsidiary, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where customers for life order their cheques, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy’s stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was later informed by Starr, my “trusted personal banker,” and they were in queue for the same reason as me.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from which they had been switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction society), from the credit unions and savings boxes of their hometown whose whites only operate within the state of belonging, and who claim to treat clients like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers were heading to their homes Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a bailout buyer.
Workers in offices and shops standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank that is considered a safe haven, which is doing most rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her distressed-looking chief executive Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if they complained about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, fiftieth and somewhat a guardian in my apartment block uniform, has changed the normal course of our talks about Brad and Angelina or my shopping at the shopkeeper.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "now I have all my savings in money market funds.
The switching is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslim tombs profaned as Austria approaches the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the far-right Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization “Cities Against Islamization” in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs representing mosques with a red line crossing.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made enormous gains in the country’s general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at Traun cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believed was an organized action.
Criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David’s Star over some of the tombs, but investigators think this may have happened by attempting to hide the real motives of hate-driven extremists against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which came to Muslim religious as the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the right-wing in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehement and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burkas, and also expressed opposition to food considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing policy of Islamization in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change came mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Forbidden travel abroad for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star responsible for sexual abuse of children, from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a ban on travel abroad last Thursday after judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, but was represented by attorney Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Magistrates Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad as he does to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the register of sexual offenders.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
and it is also necessary that you inform the police of the planned date seven days in advance of your departure.
Kent police said they wouldn’t discuss the individual case or Glitter’s possible place of residence in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said, “The Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said, “The Kent police will do everything they can to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of county-registered sex offenders and minimize any risk that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese jail for abuse of two girls aged 10 to 11 years.
When Glitter was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he would return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the UK for four months in 1999 for possession of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of Interior reported that Jacqui Smith, the Interior Minister, was reassured and glad to hear that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"I capture the master off-scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
Aside the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressivity of a hand, carefree because they will not come to the scene.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, growing every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be anyone but, when viewing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on scene passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don’t have to take pictures from the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the big flamenco.”
With the flavor of the "Canto de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate chamber.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall classical photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical basis of the image, conferring modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises each day".
It is not the action of the dance, the singing or the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential, with the duende that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Photomata.
Known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter your life for an instant, be it a long or a short moment.
In photography, portrait is the hardest genre.
You encounter or face people, characters, who you sometimes don’t even know, or who leave you only a few minutes to be able to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco bearing the title "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery El Photomata, located at number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until next October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a temerity"
It is set in places that he does not yet know and verses on unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to bringing forward the new project on which he works, a novel that has as protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and went through the Amazon.
The ever-favorite Nobel Prize winner of Literature confessed yesterday in his visit to Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today occupies him "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were wise, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it sometime," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he has seen a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the word festival and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of Dickens' "Our Mutual Friend", filled the theatre Juan Bravo.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before himself an intense audience surrendered to which he was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian Favocation, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extrordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "livering more than he lived"; how he writes of his "in" with a disciplinary.
The Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said it "has effects" and "makes people more inconsistent," so he asked the writers "not to abandon their frivolity and responsibility."
The climate diminishes the fair of Pozoblanco which also remains without rejoins
The feast of squares closing the fee for the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the announced squares checked that the floor of the square was not in the best condition.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the run.
The weather has started with this fair, as finally two of its three celebrations have not been celebrated.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the planned second bull race.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a castle of Castilblanco.
Only on Friday was there a celebration.
In it, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante gave his two greetings and an ear, which granted more the layings than his toreo.
Yes, even worse was El Julio, which went through the coso of Los Llanos without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief effort, a large part of the audience was won.
A control in Álava jumps in a van with 2,000 kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armiñón (Álava).
The agents give up the two occupants of a van and they embark on the flight.
His cargo, more than two tons of hashish, was not like to stop.
The officers pursued and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A.A.J., the Basque Government’s Interior Department said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and counterfeiting of public documents.
The incident occurred when several Alava Traffic Unit officials carried out a transportation check on the N-1, as they passed through the municipal territory of Armiñón.
They were prepared to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, accelerated sharply and skipped control.
The agents began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arc, when its two occupants set out to flee to the race through a forested area.
The Ertzainas finally reached one of them and seized from the 2,178 kilograms of hash that they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bags, so they moved it to police units for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
Furthermore, officials verified that the registration had been "folded" as it did not match the collection in the van's documentation, so an offence of public document counterfeiting has also been charged with the arrest.
The Ertzaintza continues the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to flee the race as said, and determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, 28-year-old A. A. J., was transferred to police units to carry out the corresponding diligence and will be available to court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the effects of some medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, has been detained this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effects of some medicine.
A witness saw her perform strange manoeuvres while trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for California’s road patrol has revealed to People magazine.
The witness detailed that at about 16.30 p.m., Locklear "was stepping deeply on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and backwards, and as he walked backwards he passed several times above his sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who had apparently not recognized the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who notified emergency services because "he was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, it found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and excess alcohol was discarded from the start, although "as the officers observed at first glance, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect of driving under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison around 19.00 hours but was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he recovered from an anxiety and depression.
Callamazares urges the Andalusian federation of IU to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of former Councillor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of carrying out favor treatments to relatives.
"I am very federalist for these things, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its competences," Llamazares said on the action that the party will have to take with the so far councillor in the Seville consistory.
However, the leader of IU argued that the need for "transparency" is present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "IU has always argued that such matters have the highest degree of transparency."
In the same line he stressed that the training has “strict ethical codes for all public offices.”
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós’ National Episodes, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of nearly 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría leading a broad cast of interpreters.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become the future of a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this shooting "a childhood dream", who must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a film commemorative of the second centenary of the 2nd of May Madrid, something he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has provided in its entirety constitutes for Garci a "unique opportunity" to set up with the decorated and the appropriate clothing the portrait of "a flooded Spain that was wrong as a boss to fight for, since, the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Ferdinand VII," he noted.
But the filmmaker regrets not having a funding like that of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than twice that of Sangre de May - so he has not been able to shoot some scenes plasmated in a script signed with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
For this reason, the director of Retomar, has focused on what is his usual way of working, the stage with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, for seeming to him "humiliating" and considering that "part of the director's profession lies in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works."
Many of the interpreters with whom Sangre de May coincides repeat before his chamber, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Oscar nominee on four occasions - of which she won one - Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, Seven French pool tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one to be disclosed," he said.
With this film Garci does not expect awards.
“In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you’re content with making one more movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career trajectory.
Isabel Bayón regains the essence of the Sevillan dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer is going to pay homage to a Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, of Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the neighborhood of Triana and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dance specialist.
He had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dancing and aesthetic revolution in the interwar Europe fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character and it seemed amazing to me.”
According to the dancer, "We do not intend to tell her life but to gather her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, "the dance of the butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "the dance of the snake" a few tangos.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also within this aesthetics,” she says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing to Isabel again in one of his shows, as he did in the one of "La puerta abierta"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever was her pupil.
"Matilde makes Tortola older, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have agreed to act in my work and I am very honored for it."
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were divas in all their extent, and always,
The work also somehow tells the life of this woman who developed in places as far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she habitually resided in London.
"I wanted to recall her because I think it's from those women who have an enormous influence in a given time and now no one knows and much less puts their work in value," says Bayón.
The show will begin today at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Council of Culture of the Board of Andalusia to celebrate the "Fifty Zenobia and Juan Ramón's anniversary" (2006-2008).
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Chopo de Luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the various provinces of New York, was held during the course.
Likewise, the Council of Culture of the Junta de Andalucía has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Recién Casado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America is less liked without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absent of Malicia", and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and the whole of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
Look, it cost them to give him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And I knew he was very sick.
Still, it has been a mazazo for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond all expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country were better thanks to their existence.”
No one was afraid of ridiculing or exaggerating.
A father of film and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, fearful of terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you remain, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for everyone an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and gained causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his first-born dead from overdose to his brand of homemade and organic food.
It’s a gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicide food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration burdened Hollywood without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man but one era has died.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was neither more nor less than the summit of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“It has left us all very high,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping the demand of probeness high and having a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But some are trying, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but then was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was faithful when he surely had the chances of not being.
"But why am I going to eat a burger outside of the house, if I have a steak inside?" he used to joke himself.
In heaven he has the pride that his daughters on earth match his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of a devout husband, a lover, a caring grandfather and a dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I say no!
The perfect race was called, and in my opinion it has been the worst long race I've ever been in.
A clump of disadvantages that, of course, if you took it into account as an evaluation and I examined it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let’s go in parts and from the beginning.
Unintendedness begins with collecting the dorsal, which makes you have to go earlier.
Which doesn’t seem bad to me, but if they already make you go, let them give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, I don't.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first unpurpose, go just for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the t-shirt (second unpurpose, because I need a size XL)
In what world do we live?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a little bit compared to those on the day of the race.
Apart from having to go very soon to pick up the chip, the tail on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
More than 35 minutes lasted the wait, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as expected, the race started and we hadn’t left the backpack yet, although once we got it, the pick-up was worse.
In addition, the rain deterred waiting for more than 40 minutes, which was gathered with conates of popular rebellion and assault on the cottage.
I think about 500 people will surely have pulmony tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the right time in the ranking, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, didn’t mark my exit correctly.
Of course, if I were asked about the perfect race, this would not go into my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies conference Microsoft has shown a breakthrough of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) serving what you listen to in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the room, who they are - even remember what they wear - and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group the presents according to the conversation groups.
In the video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
Ask him if he is there to visit someone and tell him that he will take care of him soon.
All without a blue screenshot.
Awesome.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the essential rather than commercial garbage loads, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole finding taking into account that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome came into the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
Many correctly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for Hardware and Software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear, but you have to think of the operating system’s “death” not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer is booted only to run Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come on the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft’s employee rest rooms in Redmond earlier this month.
In the soft drinking machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009 but at the end of 2010.
In Microsoft they will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, becomes more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, is going to pay a bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick’s ‘Blood Diamond’, as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola’s ‘The Godfather’ and is part of the uniform of the musculated gay parish.
And if we start to enumerate star appearances, we can go back to the image of that sharp mustache who raised weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical cotton, strapped and sleeveless men's inner t-shirt.
The 'tank', which the English speakers call, but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels scores above all the others.
First, by her ringing name - though familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with sport because it is named, according to legend, by boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above the others for its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive shield and the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most iconic t-shirt models wear as detail on the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweaters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sea t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for comfort underwear.
It is a shame to leave them as underwear.
They have too much charm.
“I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn’t care.”
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the sisters Cruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than a few beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, winning on short distances.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, as well as attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense but, at the same time, exciting day.
What is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the films of the 1950s and 1960s; from that we get many references.
Then, I like to miss out on a city and watch women dressed, combined and mixed their clothes, I do a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of ties in common.
I liked clothes since I was a kid; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to hover in my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I was dressed.
You know that dancers really like to make our styles for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress when you get the wardrobe it is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, that yes, with a lot of respect for the designers and professionalism.
You haven't been 30 years ago, have you come into a crisis?
What's up?
I feel better than ever, I like the 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was young and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I’m going to be a mother because the body asks me to do so and I also want to be a young mom; I don’t want to miss this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you’re awaiting several premieres you shot last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to seeing the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from theatre, I am very impatient and restless, everything I want for now and of course, can't be.
I look forward to the premiere of 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
Looking forward to seeing what they look like...
You debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell a few days ago, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I went to a gateway to make a model.
Simply called me Naomi Campbell, who I know for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charitable parade for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took out two pieces of our collection for Mango - were auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People do not know that sweet heart of Naomi.
There are so many things being said about her that, I know her, I would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I stay with that good part she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to make the pine, so too.
For the benefit of women in the Third World, whatever it takes.
Alcohol-related drivers will have to install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholemia, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents starting the vehicle drunk, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual record of the State Attorney General, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its purpose is the re-insertion of the driver, so this will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the Attorney General’s Office of Road Safety, the Traffic Directorate General (DGT) and the Technological Institute for Automotive Safety Foundation (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving drunk pick up the car again.
The alcohol lock would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in breathing air and prevents starting the car if the driver does not blow abutments; or when an alcohol concentration is detected is higher than permitted.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be paid for the penalty.
In this regard, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 lives every year.
The measure relates to administrative sanctions for two reasons: addressing these behaviors before they lead to criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by the criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been implemented experimentally in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on a PSOE initiative in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, just as it has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 17.40 p.m., the scheduled time in the program, the Spanish air force plane on which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juarez de Mexico DF.
The sun was withdrawing but its rays still forced him to use his hand as a visor to see the real couple descend from the plane.
Walking on a staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours before, he had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you won't be able to go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's a Spanish but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and to a military fence formed by 27 navy soldiers who interpret the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the princess, mellow to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps had he been told that in the DF threatened storm.
They give the photographers a smile and a squeegee to stop before going to the room where the official comitiva awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the city’s four majors, a Mexican television reporter awaits them.
The Best Endowed Prize in Fashion
Possibly there is no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion award, that Paris and possibly there is no living designer more exquisite and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango showcase at 54th Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cryed out of excitement.
By the way, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank designer Valentino who chaired the jury of the contest, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with her heart broken of grief and doing her heart, by the recent death of her brother, put on a suit from the House and some dressings from ELAH, which cut off the breath, and from the arm of her son Louis - a cannon almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner tribute.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, made the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, alongside the baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the shop with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she transformed in a sexy long black dress, was thrilled when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were shown the ballet rehearsal and she, remembering other times, clinged to one of the bars and made a 'grand' amago.
Inés Sastre did not stay on the walk through the buildings of the palace, but he previously showed us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to rejoice the view with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another cannon traveling by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously requested that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 plus one ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic daily life.
And for the short, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it’s even worse to imagine yourself wrapped in the hectic rhythm that today’s life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is not one or two methods to fight daily exhaustion and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number rises to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Aside from yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities tailored to each one's taste and minutes.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and its calm will reach the bookstores of the hands of the publishers Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers it not possible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denys such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the sofa, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking asleep
Some children talk at night.
I’m not referring to those who wake up very awake, telling us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk while asleep.
The first time it happens maybe you get scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somnilochios.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I’m sure more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once in the month...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause to determine its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (being asleep) or sleepwalking, but it doesn’t have to be so.
As we mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fever, stressful situations or overexcitation.
Anyway, it is a poorly studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or quite the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense it would be advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him out in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress picture).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to bed.
So look for quiet games and avoid shows or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With children who are very nervous and who have a lot of trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will enable the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
Once sleepiness appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his dream.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and therefore resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes, you should consult or find out what generates so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common thing), do not fall into the temptation to make him an interrogation to extract information from him.
You will not get anything, because when you are asleep you are not conscious how to organize your thought.
Furthermore, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say that, with which very careful in how you interpret the information and with the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Ilhaeusern at last!
The soccer club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way to victory on their field after a long period of shortage.
Without a good match, the team created many goal opportunities and was able to score a goal to win the game.
The pace was not very constant during this meeting in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to rub the squad with a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern quasi would take the "power" and in turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we didn’t let the midfielder pass and we left only Riahi in an attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two goal occasions from Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well positioned to pick up the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the scorer Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be forced to go back in the wardrobe a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take the opportunity and it will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who stepped back a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of play during which, after an important bump, the ball passed very close to the transverse field.
Sarkozy finds angry fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a rodeo for Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by the fishermen who severely disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the president of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet his representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and hoped that he would " come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general assembly of the " crisis committee " created by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the rise in diesel prices, which set a record at reaching 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses re-competitive and to save the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors.”
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to decrease circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused jams of nearly 10 km.
The marina of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
" A filter barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, scratching dawn, tire and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Manche, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous remained in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the major Total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday’s meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the “crisis committee” will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not abandon " and " do not want to move to Paris " , announced for example Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient fisheries committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel oil, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached with only one diesel oil with a price of less than 0.30 euros per liter.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two Men and One Destiny " has died from cancer, at age 83, at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the film legend and engaged actor, Paul Newman, who has passed away at age 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession in the world economy.
The world’s fourth aeronautical manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer Chairman Fredrico Fleury Curado reaffirmed.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
Insurer American International Group, which has been brought out of trouble thanks to U.S. monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets with the aim of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to Sunday's edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, the newspaper said.
AIG’s board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of which AIG intends to separate include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made about these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to repay its 85-billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the proper proportion of current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused of a historic drop last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, i.e. an unseen loss on the stock exchange of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones industrial index fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In point terms, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day exchanges re-started after the terrorist attacks on September 11.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index dropped 199.61 points to 1,983.73 units and the expanded Standard & Poor’s 500 8.81% (i.e., 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 units, according to the final figures of the closure.
Already depressed by the crisis early in the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the media he asked for.
Nearly two in three Republicans rejected their plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how far the market had this plan,” added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would arrive “too late.”
"If the project is really dying ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the relief (the U.S. Central Bank, the N.N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten credit conditions further," said Brian Bethune, head of Economy and Finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the feeling of urgency, "every day that passes is announced the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
Following Washington Mutual's bankruptcy last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated dramatically, triggering emergency interventions for the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not just a U.S. crisis but a global crisis,” the analyst at FTN Financial added.
The bond market rose dramatically.
The yield of the 10-year treasury bond declined by 3.632%, from 3.827% on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4.161%, from 4.357% on the eve.
Obama wins first televised duel
Friday’s first debate between the two White House candidates followed another to find out who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, though honorable, was “not quite “brilliant” to allow him to stop his decline in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Sabbath grants five points of edge to Obama (49% against 44% for McCain), judges it is the Democrat who went well.
Among the undecided voters, which are the ones that count, Obama came over with 39% of respondents, while 25% of them granted the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good performance of his own candidate member, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts,” he nevertheless warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Septuaginario McCain highlighted his undisputed foreign policy experience, underlining his opponent’s “naiveness” on these issues that were at the heart of this first caree.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama said he represented the future.
Without becoming confused, he was concise and accurate.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already understood,” he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertising reproaching the Republican for not considering the importance of the crisis’s impact on Americans.
“During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rain.
“The financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is regarded by Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the brink of the cliff.
“Next week could be a decisive episode,” Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the final consequence of eight years of a poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that he would nevertheless cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street shocks, the Illinois Senator also noted that the realization of an eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a 45-nuclear power plant park by 2030.
Cautiously, both candidates avoided issues that referred to the $700 billion financial rescue plan (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " Have you noticed the elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislature in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday afternoon from the closure of electoral centers in central Minsk square to protest the fraudulent nature of the legislative.
While no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Lukashenko: "the dictator, he has to resign."
Some acknowledge that they did not vote: “Why, as they will do what they want with my vote,” says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that gave foreign observers a good face in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
" We have been placed next to the electoral committees and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes," said Yuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous reunification of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, it is the executive power.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
"But their entry into parliament can mean television appearances, meetings in the regions, and bills."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must be started.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, comes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
It stresses that participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) favored manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Interrogate the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the electoral centers.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies to parliament, those best suited to power.”
The silence of the night returns again to the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the central electoral commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is Safe Again
Héma-Québec was celebrating its 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to be happy because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained public trust that had been seriously hesitated by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and the discontent of the public, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, aiming to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster should no longer be reproduced.
While Judge Krever was late in presenting his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Society with blood to supply all other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, nearly 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalled Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After making many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence,” he says before proudly claiming that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population in Quebec had now confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary nevertheless recalls that “trust is extremely fragile.”
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed the birth of numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the crazy cow disease, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells Décary.
And we didn’t know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations in the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we don’t know and when a serious disease can emanate from that, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease which is characterized by a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, we institute exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown without any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied was meaningful.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique of HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleidic acid tests that allow the presence of the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors rather than that of antibodies against the virus, which were founded in the tests used so far.
Nucleid acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
We have thus substantially reduced the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them.
These improvements significantly lowered the risk of getting AIDS by a blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
“This means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before anyone gets infected with HIV.
Thus, since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will pass more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I think you can nowadays receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without worries,” says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the Western Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
One must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary pursues before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for sufficient supply.
" Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
As the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences on the blood donor network, which on average regroups only 3 per cent of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
All people with good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
Needlessness is very rare.
But members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it’s hard to convince people to donate their blood, but especially to retain them and encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since today’s life is very unrestrained, we rarely find the time to spend an hour to donate your blood,” said Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We have celebrated a few weeks ago, placing on the bank our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and it is expected to take more than a thousand of these a year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
" Many moms are disappointed not being able to enjoy this," since Héma-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact in the Semi-Finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-finals of the U.S.L. first-division qualifying series, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in short ends) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the quarterfinal series, at Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without goal anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goal opportunities.
Roger Levesque was the only one who defeated Matt Jordan by the Sounders.
Remember that during the first game of the round-the-clock series on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle suburb.
The impact will be measured to the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the back game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals 5-4.
The impact is expected to face the Whitecaps next Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Briefly – The Victory Goal of Kovalev
The Canadian number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian to the free-shot barrier against the Florida Panthers, yesterday night, at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev collected a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by scoring the only goal.
“I’m not ready yet, I warn the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play to the maximum in the first time, scored Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation."
Charest occupies the north
Prime Minister does not exclude launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ends, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to make himself elected during today’s partial election.
Rejecting the boundaries of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength staying on the main lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large media as during the electoral period.
The Prime Minister thinks the elections will take place this autumn, although he showed that his schedule was very full.
The “North Plan” is the fourth side of a “vision” that the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, that of a “new economic space”, which includes an agreement on labor with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explain why the North was "a jewel of immense potential," but gave no termination, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could be mostly more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, forestry, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to the enumeration of Mr. Charest.
This "territory twice as large as France" is our home, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it is in us,” he insisted, as to show that he was requesting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the laugh towards gold in Abitibi, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it is our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, comprises a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said during the press conference.
“It is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time, and when the occasion comes, I repeat that position on the part of the government,” he said.
Furthermore, “with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North,” he said speaking of the northwest passage, which will open every year due to the casting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers occupying the territory a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebec Ungava party), have already started consultations about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role began some work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting at which " a common vision will be given " .
Northern development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan "will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have otherwise thought of turning challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes for the weekend, which began Friday with a big cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival to the party’s power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in the Adélard-Godbout reservoir.
“From Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” declared Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
Touching the topic of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This remains among us, but I plan to be there," he entrusted to his militants, sparking applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that no elections would take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows him.
He stresses that his schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a federation council mission in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The general weekend council supplied the Liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no difficulty being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular calls for recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
It also wishes that Quebec name members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they have a veto on decisions made in Quebec.
On the opposition side, we welcome the large lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The leader of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If I had done so, "we would have made progress today," commented Mrs. Marois alongside her candidate at Jean-Talon (vote held today), Françoise Mercure.
Quebec’s Democratic Action seemed to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letters - A Disgraced Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed to say last summer that Luisa Arbour was a "disgrace" for Canada.
Thus dishonor this woman who carried an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration what she says all about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not take into account in any way the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are blamed on him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child-soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who runs with a false justice to assess the accused's guilt.
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn’t matter if a young adult is psychologically destroyed, undoubtedly forever after so many years of exaggerations.
We do not yet realize that, but we are now witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word that Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no more morality: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government of a minority so far wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that praises Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what did the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews, the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In his September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice President and Director of Canadian Miner Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold states that the largest gold company in the world tried a six-million-dollar defamation proceeding against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution for defamation, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way to hold a public debate would be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the litigation is of little importance, so the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the miner's almost bottomless pockets.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will cuddle the opposition and frighten anyone who dares to examine the matter again.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it was in front of public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done for change of ideas and not for strokes.
It was therefore sufficient for the miner to open up its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that would have been able to clarify the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can call for a "public" debate by despising his views?
According to the Vice President, it seems that this word refers only to highly paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What he doesn't understand - or what he doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the audience that holds the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does it mostly because he rejects the brutal way of the miner.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized changes in arguments, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a persecution-bite (which is pursuing the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just filed a requirement with respect to the authors of Noir Canada urging them to stop using this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal discourse, Barrick Gold's process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and of truth, essential for all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and debate the facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that dislike the wealthy companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s outsized persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he claims, he has no desire to have a transparent debate.
It’s a loss for the university world, but also for public debate in Canada, and it’s time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It particularly envisaged: better control by the elected on its implementation, new mechanisms aimed at ensuring the reimbursement of the public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses enforced by non-payment, as well as a right to control the wages paid to the managers of the companies rescued.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Chairman of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon of negotiations that lasted two days.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” Bush administration representative Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis,” she said.
“It’s the fundamental point: if we don’t do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances on Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had ended very quickly in recent hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new failure in investor mood.
The last hour they had set was the opening of markets this morning.
The two candidates in the U.S. presidential elections, who have joined the late negotiations, showed themselves rather favorable to the deal, without forgetting to express their discontent of being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly the one that would allow owners to retain their home and that on the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, we should not congratulate them.
But these measures are necessary,” he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, questioned on another chain to ask if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it."
"The important points I read show that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to advance.
He said the choice of not doing anything is not acceptable.”
The 700 billion plan aims to buy from taxpayers money the doubtful debts, risky and unsoldable assets of American financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the burst of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and leading to a freezing of liquidity and a disbanding of banks and financial institutions.
It’s a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe we have come out of stagnation since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the goal of removing the roughness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to bear losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would aim to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president sees it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will get stakes in the relief companies that will be worth dividends in the event of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm passes.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the embargo procedures concerning housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as set limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the House of Representatives vote from today and that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest this project yesterday, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s finance commission, told his voters that “with all evidence, Washington doesn’t want to understand.”
“We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not the one that consists of taking advantage of taxpayers.”
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems otherwise, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to tell us: We ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had again the proof of the world nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments had been necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was resigning from buying its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the risky real estate loan crisis in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
Instead, we regain a voting right in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and families would appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the Manche, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley bank and more than €41 billion ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank's branches and bank accounts.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Compromised Icon
His blue eyes represented for so long his triumph.
Had the American actor with a charming smile released himself from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His humility, his sensitivity, and a talent that was evident will also have kept him away from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at age 83 from lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the latest icons in American cinema of the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, to whom he resembled much and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic covenants.
Mixed blood often makes children magnificent.
Born in Ohio in 1925, he was a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No excessive ego, last brand of quality.
Because it projected a whole country in love with the self-made man, the Pacific war fighter, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before succeeding in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who milited for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him also disappear the secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star, allergic to the scandals of the spectacle world that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death provoked vertigo for filmmakers this weekend, as their big roles shocked on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of seventh American art in perpetual moving parades through it.
Many memories return to memory as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone to the history of cinema.
This criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic mangant in the sumptuous movie The Sting, Oscar for Best Movie in 1973.
Bitter billiard player and vengeant in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Epochs change during his career.
The young people get to know him especially thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen Brothers.
With a final role as a godfather of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends that quit the race quite soon, Newman stayed a lot in the world of film, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its mess and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, with humor, "a challenge that lives in "underplaying" and that judges its performances too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he played less often the role of young gallan than marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed his true pudic sensitivity to not very well-known sides.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott due to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of humility and sadness.
Among the numerous tributes that were triggered yesterday to Newman, his great friend and former armsmate Robert Redford (they had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very saddened: " My life and my country were better thanks to their existence " .
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, there is also a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester against the excesses of Hollywood.
We will have seen his face reign over the pots of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than contenting himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What were they producing in the Zuschlag bill factory &amp; Co. ?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant harm, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the forgery of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfilment of tasks with fake invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in total some 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and in part in the pocket of private individuals.
The method, which was also disclosed by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with fake invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most invoices were fake.
To do this, the stamps were obtained in the market of the Józsefváros District and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice should be made was decided, among others, on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region to which János Zuschlag sent to István Sidos.
The latter confessed that he had to choose hostels and restaurants for this purpose.
He requested invoice for his consumption and these served as a model to make the invoices they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as the City Hall of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by István Sidos and his accomplice András <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the necessary reports to obtain the public grants.
During one of his "study trips" Sides chose a brewery.
According to two bills issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and his accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the center manager - so many people don't fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three bedrooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, yet the bill consisted of one hundred and thirty people.
But the invoice makers of great fantasy also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft gastronomy center. because in the bookstore of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor’s office and showed the bills, he already knew they were fake documents.
"On the stamp the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: in addition to formal problems, he did not agree that according to the bill there were a hundred people, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant hasn’t been working for a long time.
The enthusiastic bill makers also did not report that the travel agency chosen in Budapest is exclusively organizing travel abroad, so on the cash invoice they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which neither matched the agency’s practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as it was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, despite travel outside the territory of the European Union being tax-exempt.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the foundation Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>rt, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent of VAT, plus the hotel employees only issued machine-made invoices but the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "senders" made other mistakes as well, as in the case of a company in which they put on the bill as the activity carried out road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - does not carry out the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - inadequate format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those invoices.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when Fiatal Városért Egyesület’s group ate there (2001), the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, which is why the liquidation process man - according to our information - denied that he had issued such a document.
They consciously expired the bills.
Another group of fake invoice manufacturers are those who were aware that they should issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictional bills.
In the same way, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices, Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation, which in 2003 supplied invoices worth approximately five million HUF to the foundation Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány , the real association Atlasz Egyesület and the economic association Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület .
There was no movement of capital either, as they then cancelled the bills prepared but forgot to make this entity recorded in their documents.
The following group of fake invoice makers includes those who have some links with the defendants.
Thus, for example, Ivan Kubatov was the defense officer of the Ukrainian manager of the fictional headquarters in Budapest, which dealt with the fuel and vehicle trade.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been under settlement since 14 September 2005.
The company’s manager was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have dispatched the company-related documents between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for the Atlasz, for the Hoppa and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány by collecting the amount himself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies effectively worked because - according to the defendant - they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice, attorney Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the Zuschlag-related organizations: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generació.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade delivered a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of invoices.
This man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri Commandite to issue fictional bills used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generación and Szövetség to Modern Magyarországért presented a competition in January 2006 to Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
The competition earned HUF 500,000 respectively, but did not use the money for the competition’s objectives.
To prevent this from being discovered, five fictional invoices received from the Works Team Kft were submitted to the TMA.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Árpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the accused will likely report in the trial - as they did at the Prosecutor's Office - the course of counterfeiting invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of the main defendant himself János Zuschlag, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not been done so far.
The question is, what interest has it in doing so?, for perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists reached an agreement with him to have Zusi assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to relieve his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of economic crimes of much higher value, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait for the sentence in their own home, he has no possibility for that.
Psychology of Overlappings: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people don’t want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups was playing lottery, the other was participating in an auction and in the meantime the active brain areas of the participants in the experiment were examined by the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI).
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the brain cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the “self-award” mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention to not provoke an intense stratum reaction.
To support his theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply communicated the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the group members even lost that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by checking the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
For those until now explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation,” stated Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When Should You Go to the Doctor?
In the world, about 500 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is considered one of the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated at one hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms resemble a lot; they are characteristic of liver infection and yellowness, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses in dependence on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body moods (sperm, vaginal mood, saliva).
It is recommended for travellers to be protected by vaccine against viruses A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by a general poor condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, on the skin and on the white of the eyes, yellowness appears, excrement becomes light, dark urine and healing can last even two - three weeks.
Annually, a million people worldwide die from cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten infected people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms only appear 20-30 years later.
Therefore, early recognition, systematic medical monitoring is very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who carry tattoos.
Currently, around 200 million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a routine laboratory check as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease is healed if discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so it can suppress contagion and prevent cancer.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less to those who believe in God?
According to the results of a recent investigation, religious faith has a soothing effect that also relieved the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
As part of this unique experiment, they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was verified that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate alongside the academics.
The analysis took place as follows; they fixed a sparking instrument to the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato from the 17th century and the Lady of Leonardo da Vinci's Armiño from the 15th century.
The researchers had hoped that the show of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo’s oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour on a MRI scanner, receiving in that period 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts while watching either the religious theme painting or the other.
Catholics claimed that by looking at the Virgin Mary they felt in "security" as people "protected", "reassured themselves and in their heart reigned peace."
When they looked at the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any such shocking image you can achieve a similar effect with atheists as well, you just have to find the right image.
“We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively for, like for a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases truly changes our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results there remains a single question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can say: you can find him both in people’s pocket and in the sky above your head; he knows where your vacation was, what doctors they visit, and what they are interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is not enough yet.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s primary goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather in one system all the information of the world!”
According to the Google leader, the company even after ten years of work that turned it back to the World is still in the early stage of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question what’s going to happen in five years Schmidt answered as follows: I wish Google could answer questions like “What to do tomorrow?” or “What work would best suit me?” – however, the software will not be able to answer such seemingly simple questions as long as there is not enough user information.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their browsing on the Network, the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages they went through are accurately stored.
Thanks to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-check what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic will be based the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What happens if they exploit my data against me, if they collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are concerned about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they not only retain, but in justifiable cases also transfer to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of Internet users.
The most debated example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, when Google handed over to the Brazilian government the information on its web page, called Orkut, to identify the paedophiles.
On the other hand, Internet users worrying about people’s rights in May were alleviated when the company along with EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, successfully demonstrated before the court that it was right in their dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google will not be forced through any of the constitution points to provide any kind of information requested by the FBI in secret.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get under the pretext of reinforcing the child protection law passed years ago, about 50,000 web addresses and some 1,000 phrases searched, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
Thus is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think their privacy, their privacy is undermined by starting to use Google’s services, and rebel against it as against multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, Internet users and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "front-end corporation", not so its rival, Microsoft, catalogued by its Windows as the World Conqueror, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This may happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, doesn’t ask users for any identification code or money for their applications, the source is open and the free program package, constantly updates and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the official software giant’s practice.
But it may also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that came from just one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: the Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaborating, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measurements of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even link them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm offering a list of their music customs, then these can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, in which the most recent photo galleries are automatically displayed in the F.
We can know many cases from which it emerges that, for example, the bride, when seeing the stream of photographs the following morning from common friends, learns with whom her fraudulent boyfriend spent the night before or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the address of the company: one thing is sure, the definition of privacy was completely revalued.
A person's "online" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of the youth of our day.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting for example with the Scroogle that uses Google’s search system but leaves no footprints).
There are many people who don’t want to register on collective pages to prevent them from finding them, but Google’s “online” apps can be replaced, from text writing software to image and news reading apps with alternative versions that don’t connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible about us.
Public opinion expects almost openly the day that Google will show its true face.
The company with its current worth of $156 billion is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten advertising agencies’ revenue, while services that are increasingly rapidly introduced cause severe headaches not only to other Microsofts.
Critical observers, however, will find the contradictions alarming as well: for example, the senior management strongly rejected the protest of employees after doubling the price of the company’s childcare, considered the unlimited number of employees’ feeding too expensive, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 the regime yielded to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement.
One of the company’s internal regulations says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but only when it is ready to operate, what is sure is that the health problems predictable in the coming months and years will be able to revolve the world: while some believe that the project of scan and archive of books and magazines, we can acquire such previous dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by our U.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it will be able to provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, novel of Cory Doctorow's popular, describes in Orwelian form that future, in which a man from Google's data alone can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped erase the fingerprints of the perpetrator of the double murder of the city of Ózd.
Police questioned two minors about the double killing of Ózd who, according to reasoned suspicion, helped erase the footprints of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod province’s Public Order Office said on Tuesday.
The young women acknowledged the crime they were charged with, and they are currently being charged with the crime.
The two minors - according to the Hungarian News Agency's reports of two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in preventive detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations, it was revealed that the 23-year-old owes a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he cited his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter as well.
According to information from the MTI, the young man prepared himself much earlier to perpetrate the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime site.
The police analyze with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange submitted an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros – about five billion Czech crowns – for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state who wants to sell 60 percent of the shares within a few months.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Poles’ offer has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that it would eventually disappear the Prague Stock Exchange.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholder agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
Major European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the increasingly deep international financial crisis speak of a “September 11th.”
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. President - the Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the rushing bill made, the aim of which is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” which billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke of, it is more correct to talk about a “September 11th.”
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the mistake of the political direction of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is increasingly growing and this will then impact the whole world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote, the danger arises that Washington will not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air – precisely when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
This threat cannot be ignored, says the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still throw life belts to shaking financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
But if as the domino breaks down even more banks, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough anymore.
It is necessary in the long term for the member states of the European Union to put aside their nationalist egoism and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received only more than 100 billion euros on Monday - recalls the Vienna-based Der Standard, adding that concerns are increasingly real that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis that passes as a cuname on the Old Continent.
The "savers" won't have to immediately submit hundreds of millions of euros, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayer funds to avoid a greater evil?
The smart car mimics the beehive’s flight
What would be the best method to develop technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of obstacle sensors existing in nature?
For example, the beehives.
In a surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, the beehives gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the robotic steering system of nature-imitating BR23C cars, to which they gave the characteristics of beehives, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each beehive creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained Kazuhhiro Doi, technology director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the composite eyes of beehives that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the composite eyes, the engineers used the laser beam length measurement system.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the vehicle's microprocessor that immediately turns into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the vehicle robot mimics the movements of the beehole, changes the direction by rotating the wheels to the extent necessary.
Unlike any existing system today, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
"If it weren't so, the vehicle's robot wouldn't be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all kinds of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a beehole does to avoid other beehole.
This process should be done in an open and closed eyes.
However, unlike beehives, the movement cannot be directed upward, downward or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for beehives to avoid other beehives, here they used only rotary movement and acceleration as a possibility for the car robot in addition to braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and their energy density is higher, meaning they have a longer life than that of lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, let alone that of storage.
This apparatus in every second should only process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store these data or react with an instinctive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabyte memory or megabyte memory is needed.
This is the first step towards developing technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which, according to Nissan’s calculations, will be able to be incorporated into mass-made models within ten years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding the obstacles existing on his way.
This dear boy has a name.
The written version of the $700 billion financial bailout package, which will be implemented in several phases, has been prepared to purchase bad bank credits.
In the first phase half of the money will be spent.
According to East Coast schedule during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion financial bailout package in total, after several days of discussion, Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, saying that the deal is only formalized in one document.
The commitment made on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, talking about the outcome of the compromise said: this program will work and be efficient, but further measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the carriage of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before 8 a.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. Monday morning, according to Central Europe time), without causing a spectacular leap in the stock markets.
On the bill called the 2008 Emergency Law for Economic Stabilization, Monday will first vote the U.S. Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all the $700 billion to buy securities of poor-quality credit funds.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, the Ministry of Finance will buy credit, poorly qualified fund securities and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president’s decision.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages and securities of credit fund securities, as well as other "poisonous" type credits.
The purchase can be made on auctions or directly - competent persons of the ministry informed.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the finance portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated: “The law ensures the necessary financial means, which can reach even $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system, deal with the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance, or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some major financial institutions.”
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it,” he added.
Instead, heads of banks who are in trouble and await state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American slang simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and limitations depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry purchases in the context of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the bank’s failed boss retires.
By purchasing bad credits directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that bosses’ compensation is not exaggerated.
In addition to the foregoing, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations concern only new contracts to encourage participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in U.S. history that will be in force with a legal limitation on the income of CEOs, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional committee, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares of the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since they can ultimately even make profits from the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the bill in the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to repay the losses of the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations regarding the project.
This is not what American citizens entrusted to us, that is, taxpayer dollars are not being protected,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
Her Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur said the measures urged him the same as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there are many possibilities that around January 12 the U.S.-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will come into force - the Foreign Minister spoke about it in Chicago, to the Hungarians residing there.
In his opinion, “practically everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic.”
At the same time he warned that in the new system the entry premises will disappear, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin must register.
From today, the head of the Hungarian diplomacy holds talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice giving him the Medium Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and will hold negotiations with the international policy advisors of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ financial bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both presidential candidates for the two major U.S. parties, said on Sunday they supported the administration’s $700 million bank aid program, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Finance Minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-like negotiations, announced Sunday morning that a principle agreement was reached on the banks’ financial bailout package.
The financial package aimed at solving the Wall Street crisis and thawing the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to demonstrate that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, putting economic issues in the forefront, Obama once again gained some advantage and disappeared McCain's advantage he had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin's nomination for vice-president.
At a Detroit campaign rally last Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will promptly pass the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
“We have to act now and responsibly ... employment, the savings of you as well as entire industries and the stability of the entire economy is at risk,” he said before a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to describe McCain’s economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain, he explained that “we will all barely swallow this ... but not doing anything is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a committee of control to the finesse minister and the limitation of compensation from the executives, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, instead he consulted the minister daily.
Congressional President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen are likely to vote on the bill already on Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only within the group itself the most conscious voters became - the Der Spiegel says about the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red coalition.
The Mirror (mirror.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Devours Her Parents", he discusses the motives for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken office.
The social-Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now it is precisely these modern citizens who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
The failure was not totally surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that was already foreseen for nearly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU scored 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the so-mentioned Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong in the pace, but the secularization, the results of education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
With modernization, the possibilities are also increased and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, but within the group itself the more conscious, more critical and more stubborn voters became.
It is surprising that in recent weeks it was precisely the conventional groups of citizens who moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small-scale industrialists, those who have a bachelor’s degree and the graduates.
Thus, support for the CSU dropped to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The Vienna Conservative newspaper: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, but the Greens do not yet want to make consultations about the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely let any of their decks be seen.
Werner Faymann, the chairman of the SPÖ, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left pending the question that if he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, in the post of vice-chancellor.
He stated that in any case they disapproved the Schüssel-Molterer era.
This political trend cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offerings.
He said the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
It is still open in the party whether they will elect the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, its host is France, which this year is also president of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, MEP of the European People’s Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that beat Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing foundation of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for jobs, social affairs and equal opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights attended the meeting.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labour market first because of their low level of education.
“Most of the young Roma have not finished middle education and due to the poor quality of basic education, only an insignificant portion can obtain a university diploma.”
Járóka further emphasized that education, as a fundamental human rights, plays a decisive role in the prevailing foundation of other human rights as well.
Investing in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, these issues need to be widely aware of both Roma and non-Gypsies.
For the sooner a Roma student begins school, the more chances they will have to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumer taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
“Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be assured the right to a quality education and guarantee the abolition of segregated and low-level education,” said Jároka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to accelerate immediately the processes of school segregation, for which the correct compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives is of fundamental importance.
“We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” said Járóka.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized annually since last year’s Berlin meeting in the sign of the “European Year for Equal Opportunities” is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at the European and national levels of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
In late October, a decision will be made on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the peaks of the Bavarian CSU, the debate on personal issues has yet to be postponed.
Erwin Huber, party president, and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, still remain in their positions, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent electoral defeat, will be decided at the party’s extraordinary congress to be held last weekend in October.
The members of the critically criticized duo let it be understood: they didn’t cling so much to their positions.
In doing so, they wanted to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and base organization, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago – although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career – the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to prevail, in the future they will definitely have to make a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber’s potential successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that initiates negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about the fate is that on the list of the Free Electors that Gabriele Pauli enters the parliament, whose performance against Stoiber was exploited for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly wiped off the stage the ambitious local politics.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber will also receive an active role that so far has been moving the ropes in the background, the former provincial chief of government and former president of the CSU called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be Chancellor unless they are able to jointly enhance the CSU that played a major role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel that she could barely conceal her disappointment over failure, the losses of the CSU will not have a negative impact on the great Berlin coalition.
Which is of course relative: it will not be easier to treat the wounded CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko's opposition: 110-0
After Sunday’s election, there will be no opposition deputies in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that it guarantees in the country Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is rather explained by the violations of the law committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
While the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, composed of 10 percent and 10 deputies, more than a decade ago has no opposition, before the elections yesterday the United Opposition parliament under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who renewed his mandate for the fourth time after the 2006 elections of dubious legitimacy, as a consequence of the amendment of this Constitution.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, which is increasingly dependent economically on Russia - which took a credit to moderate the importation of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the considered pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give permission to entry for the political high Lukashenko.
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than errors - such as the prohibition of participation imposed on one third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE primary report on Monday even criticized the campaign itself – in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press – and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition feels an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is prepared to a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abhasia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - already a month ago considering the two regions as independent.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun," he told our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that “the regime fears allowing even one weightless opponent to enter that parliament.”
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations by seeing the results, rather it tries to send its message to voters about the need to make economic reforms.
"This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in its distribution, but even so I see that more and more are also supporting the change among the elderly," said Milinkevich, referring to the Lukashenko regime, who believes that its main outcome is the creation of social security, not even those who are the most officially subordinated.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the rising trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the decomposition of social security that "likes the silence of the cemeteries" - said Milinkevich.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the election democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing but the testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, more people have breakfast before they start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against who signs and then goes to the bar to have a coffee in working hours.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
“Automatic doors,” Brunetta says, “are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services,” the minister said.
“Now a new season of accountability and transparency is opening.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta once again emphasizes.
With Chigi Palace the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Council Presidency.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view."
No resistance has been found on the part of employees, the secretary-general says: “It was a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on part of them.”
In short, no more breakfast at working hours; no more coffee and middle moons.
Brunetta’s word, which suggests, smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister declares that "in three months the absences from illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, meaning 60,000 more people to work in a year."
And he adds that it is necessary to make public administration more effective.
In Italy, “which wage dynamics – explains the minister – over the past 8-10 years have been doubled with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rate.”
For now millions of public employees have joined to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the petition supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the slightest absence from work due to illness – writes the consumer association – the people of ‘vague workers’ are continually increasing.
Indeed, millions in Italy are the right and productive public administration employees who have joined forces to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree.
In particular, the Tar would answer the exclusion of aggregate economic treatments due to illness due to service; the extension of the time frames in which the medical inspection visits of the sick employee are carried out; and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Work Accidents, Napolitano: "Critical Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently invalid.
By 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the leading causes of death and causes nearly twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of occupational accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is,” said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, the National Association mutilated and invalid by the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of the victims and public awareness".
It has manifested itself, a 'sufficient', sincerely shared, faced with tragedies that, by their dimensions, arouse the cry of the media and the participation of the public opinion, on the contrary, the daily reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particular significance takes the numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to curb the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislation.
For his part, Chamber President Gianfranco Fini has emphasized "that the phenomenon of white deaths constitute an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a resolute effort to urgently put an end".
“The data on accidents at work seems to point to a slight positive progress, but this does not remove that the number of white deaths is equally impressive,” said Anmil Chairman Pietro Mercandelli.
Indeed, we do not want this “tendence to decrease” to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when attention decreases that the tragedy exploits.
“We believe that overall too little is done to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our discretion - Mercandelli has emphasized - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school."
"It serves a further effort - he added - as it concerns communication and public awareness.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship envisaged for labour victims" and "the care derivation to which the system is heading in recent years."
“The goal is to restore to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – because the fate of the accidenter does not have to depend on the gift provided by the legislator each time.”
Mp3 readers under charge, put hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission mentions, which in a statement released in Brussel cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the Emerging and Recently Identified Health Risk (Cssseri) of the European Union, published today.
“From this scientific opinion – read in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day with the high-volume apparatus risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“Of the scientific evidence – follows the responsibility Ue – a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What counts is to raise awareness to consumers and render this public domain information.
We must also reexamine the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are broadly effective and have the way with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the widespread use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that causes.
“Scientists,” concludes executive Ue, “confirm that it is of concern and the European Commission will now consider together with member states and stakeholders what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical devices and related devices.”
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concern increases as hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and noise exposure time.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee notes that if users of portable music devices listen to music at a high volume (more than 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week, they exceed the current limit on maximum noise granted in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, Germany gives the way to the Commission for the future of the capital
It starts today, it closes in March, the accounts will be made in June.
This is the timetable set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Fututo of the Capital of Rome", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Thermal Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will deliberate the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the strategic Piano for Rome with the "official bulletin" of the Municipality and its intendent Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is absolutely independent and represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to underline Alemanno – it must provide proposals for the development of Rome in which political decision makers, the board and the municipal council, can then be endorsed.
There is no leftover position of roles, only the willingness to have a place to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March the works completed will disappear, because this experience must have an accurate temporary end.
In June – announces the intendent – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.”
Alemanno, whom the Commission accuses of useless, as its opinions are not binding, replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be critical.
Almost always politics is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that come back and back.
On the contrary, we want to look beyond and in the long term, in a more prospective way, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future.”
The Rome intendent tends to further point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not coast a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds expressed by the capital."
For Alemanno, "a strategic design is needed as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level leap, which we absolutely need, thinking in a unitary spirit for its future."
A future that, precisely the intendent of Rome "would not be limited only to the current communal boundaries but looked beyond" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote an American political note that he is interested in being independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and tube relations (as he also does today with a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A lady from Miami wrote on a Web: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big stone face: he believes he will win the highest position in the nation that has ever had two governors and five black senators!
They’re actually attacks that don’t say much; they’re clearly racial in nature and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And there’s also the polls; everyone says Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the heart of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the cabin to vote, we will know who the American patriot will vote.
One side of the American mindset comes out covered to the last.
“Say what you want, we’ll think where to put the cross, whether on Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if he wins Obama, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the democrats is George Bush.
Have you asked 1,500 people: what have been the mistakes Bush made during his term? 89 percent have replied: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home kicked in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Likewise, Iraq for most has been Bush’s weakness.
Whoever takes the position of George W will have a huge duty to develop.
Usa, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is cut-off time. Many blame the Internet, "killer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interrogated by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimist about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The crisis of 2008 for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if you do not want traditional journalism as the majority of the public understands to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism predominates today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It’s not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many viewed as the "killer" of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” reported by journalists has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope of "doing something good" for journalism.
The biggest break today in American journalism is between who runs the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are sure their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “security of work”.
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the newspaper staff, it is 30%.
The matter of "secure work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus becomes a matter of “take it or leave it.”
Directors almost always receive good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, get "sick" followed throughout the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: THE COURT OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROOTTAFERRATE
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of real estate owner Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is questioned for bankruptcy in the field of investigation into the counter-pact relating to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of his arrest process, last week, he obtained the house release, turning it into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate owner to travel the route of the province’s city to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the representatives’ camera vote against the $700 million rescue plan launched by the White House: a significant share of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
The New York Times confirms yesterday that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old soul on the East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the states of Central and South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the vow of the one who spoke at first.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, which the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but throughout the West and not only here alone.
Whether in the United States as in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to function as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the renewal, the extraordinary reactivation, of the double category state-sovereignty in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions--which would have, if, strong financial relations with abroad, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one who immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they don’t have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union, which as always divides between different interests and different state strategies, cannot decide on any common policy.
It is the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment that the cut is reached, it is only the state that possesses the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market likely and no organization can ever dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect tune, with the utmost importance whenever the new development of the economy tends to attribute a factor very closely related to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of ever more sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do more and more with the little immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things that, behold, can certainly be transported from one place to another on earth but are equally united in absolute manner in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself as a sovereign certainly possesses many more letters about who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil, and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but predicts a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing, inadequately related economic leadership with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain way disturbing: discredit, intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of remoteness, which tends to involve the whole ruling class of the Western countries in an increasing number.
It seems to be always further advanced, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far up, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the end, to have made the time itself and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in a nutshell, underground feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimation of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which is also manifested in an electoral "revolution" or in the sudden changes in collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in the U.S. to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain.
There is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say any, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what is taking shape from today are the deep layers of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially stirs out of measure.
Faced with all this, talking about a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having the eyes open is certainly not.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like a spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come closer.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to have a body of 100 kilograms glued onto a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geeks, coated with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful from the legs of this reptile and at the same time "easily takes off from the walls," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton engineering faculty.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like man spider? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use like the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could have to do with aerospace engineering.
At the moment, no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH - Also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair that self-cleans from dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: Never with fruit juice
Pay attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing, depending on the case, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices be packed that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society ongoing to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice to reduce the absorption of some drugs, and the health effects.
Grapefruit juice was already under charge because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some medicinal anti-arythmics, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurologicals.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a bulletin of information two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that arose from this mixture and to pay attention to the thing that is drinked in case a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone is being assumed.
NOT ONLY POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milano, said: "These findings in general are pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the drug.
That is why we must always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let ourselves be impressed, clearly ask the doctor or the pharmacist,” the expert of the agency Ansa stressed.
The Novel of Economics by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editorialist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s decisions regarding the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attack, on those days that Enron was breaking down, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in the end of consequence for the United States.
A forecast that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years has been reproached to the economy, but that has now proved accurate.
“I’m surprised and a little upset by how the memory of the scandal of Enron and Worldcom’s collapse has quickly disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European central banking executive committee, Krugman is a “high value economist,” but also a “very aggressive, particularly critical of the Bush administration’s liberalism excesses.”
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the launch of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to attract more and more users, from home to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by volunteer developers, of whom their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and the less rude magazine interface, more consistent are added, such as support for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format(Open Version ISO Standard) 1.2
Also paying attention to multi-operation with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as one that allows to reduce the dimension of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic post, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graphing module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of the modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the commentary for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some of the OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, over the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the ultimate result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as normally the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of the free can be a hook for dissemination in the homes, it is in the business field that Open Office the suite tests, tries the big bet, already having several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And not even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint presentation; Dbase, eat in the case of known Access is the program that permits to work on the database; and finally Draw the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3 million 600 000, with the release of the new version is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case in the Tour de France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl of team Gerolsteiner, third-ranked and winner of the best climber shirt.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also they from the Gerolsteiner.
The tests of Kohl's blood champions are among those performed in the last few weeks in the laboratory of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and anger against the two-year canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positive doping to the Epo of the third generation is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has declared to the Associated Press that he has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, awarding himself the top of the best climber.
NEW YORK TIMES WANTS, ITALIA IS RACISTA?
Italy, a country of migrants, has only recently become a privileged destination for hostile immigrants.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted the debate on the issue of racism in Italy starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where “more integration and more work” is recorded but also the country’s highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the Northern League’s highest support.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also the new legislation wanted by the Lega tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestine citizens is cited as a paradigm of the climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI in Congress, has asked the state and the church to work together to combat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rental, up to 900 euros for a room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the tenants’ union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome.
“The phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the extent that it excludes the right to study a large portion of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to support,” explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office, “in these cities the strong demand has completely distorted the market to the point of triggering a widespread increase process even for residents.”
Apart from the fact that in most cases rental offers contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, no tax limit, sub-related rents.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of taxation, can be regulated prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza zone, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in the Victoria zone).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 euros for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It is made economy only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in the area Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room is spent from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Polyclinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
in the smaller cities the prices are lower at absolute ends, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and non-community rents is more common, a subsequent anomaly is recorded: a 25/30% increase in the canon for foreign students compared to Italians.
Goodbye to old cinema Paradiso, cities cancel historic halls
Historic cinemas close by favoring Multiplexes.
“A city without movie theaters in a blind city is like an eyeless face.”
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographs effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centers and also in the provinces.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great details in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historic places, full of memory,"it's as if a friend died, a acquaintance with whom a piece of place was shared and so much excitement", Observe the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the lost grand prize of the jury in Cannes, which counted the poetry of a provincial cinema and the nostalgia for the way of life.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of merchants, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay most are mainly the halls of the major cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most suffered by the closures are the first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 cinemas less, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for its disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new meticon cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” notes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec,” it would be useful if new structures were built, but it would be necessary to ensure the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to transfer to the meticheons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is embarrassing from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting in the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to worry about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and guard the mono-room cinema in the historic center than in the periphery.
Among the envisaged rules there are tax facilitation mediations in favor of managers and advantages for the public at ends of mobility: viewers will be allowed to enter the limited traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative I like,” notes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by setting up other measures.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of meticons, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of Bagheria cinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had already thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk ahead of the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.”
Tie between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the municipal elections for those interested in the Piromalli Cosca."
Heavy charges are given by the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria to the intendent and the vice intendent of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the intendent of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for mafia association.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the same name as the boss, already convicted of criminal mafia association and to compensate for 10 million euros.
"Despising any legal and moral norms, and of good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations with attorney Piromalli.
"The mafia family would have been allowed - write the judges - to officially enter the municipality's interior facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The chairman of the regional junta Calabrés Agazio Loiro does not hide that "deals between organized bad life there are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the deal is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes that stay clean."
Those arrested this morning are added to those of last July after police had announced the mafia family Piromalli's headcut.
Since the end of last April, the city council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been solved from the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendent of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the balotage in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the city council.
I call in question the Deputy Minister of the Interior who at the time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything for a political matter, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the availability to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the public administration elections over the interests of the mafia families."
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is now discovered by the world’s largest energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of collecting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, along with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When oil prices were low in 1980, the idea of taking advantage of marine energy was turned away, but now that environmental cases and the new oil rise are giving momentum to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated by 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This amount would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 sealed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying technology on ocean energy – said the spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil colony to the Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining a permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a fairly important signal, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron is New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, even if not detailed, indicates an interest in rising.
Technology to develop.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that has a great environmental impact.
For now the impacts like those Portuguese or the Scottish are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a boa system attached to each other.
The force of the waves, which causes the boas to move up and down, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine that in turn powers a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through underwater cables.
For now, there are four such implants in development, awaiting only federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is now producing energy for a mall and a parking lot, using underwater turbines on the East River in New York.
The movement of water when there are tides, rotates the pallets of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that it has a long cast of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electrical Energy, merits at this time the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is mainly about tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coastline, have invested $7 million and a half in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is expected by 2009.
