The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, totalling 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous major coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday after the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the move.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal policy.
According to previous results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last election in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which lost nearly nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst outcomes of these two major parties in post-war Austrian history, and especially with the People’s Party, which demanded the early elections, this is a truly catastrophic outcome.
Even in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear edge in front of the SPÖ.
The voters, however, probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party’s president and former deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the party chairman on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. for a renewal of the great coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberal parties (FPÖ) received 18 percent of the vote, the BZÖ 11 percent of the vote - but at the same time the Social Democrats expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated, even when the People's Party had clearly reached agreements with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005).
Obviously, Jörg Haider insists on this development, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and is going from a return to Vienna to Austrian federal policy.
The Green Party also entered the parliament, but it suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably overcome the four percent barrier and therefore did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it fails to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been charged in India with the unlawful gathering of beetles, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was stressed by the minister in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then surely, there will be some cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive could be difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
Nevertheless, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exonerated from the indictment and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling wanted the case to fall under the jurisdiction of whose case.
"His problem could be resolved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi’s view is that it would be best if he appealed to a higher instance.
In this way, he could ask for release on deposit and wait freely for his judgment, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner said the same during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole affair is to have the convicted “competent legal assistance” flourish, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said such aid was already offered to them by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, before his partner, the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really think it’s a big mistake to imprison and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter was not accepted by the Minister.
“I have already been promised quite a lot,” he merely said.
A Czech judges about the struggle for the seabed
It accesses an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are mapped.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and Marine Rights.
His chief, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
This is where work and enthusiasm prevail.
The seabed houses a world so far little known, rich in natural sources.
Here you can find oil, moreover ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to developing a cancer drug.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The coastal states today vehemently declared their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN convention, they make use of their rights to which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay on Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches into the sea a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
Simply put, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface, is considered.
It crosses the borders of the coastal sea, often also the border of two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the latter three countries have succeeded,” adds Mikulka.
An international echo recently came to Australia’s success, which was the first country to significantly expand its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was granted to the country by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that flows to them from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be of invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratifie the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the territory of the ocean soil, which the Convention refers to as the "common heritage of mankind", begins.
No state has a special position here anymore.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the sea floor is not a gold graveland," says Director Mikulka, adding that "individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Category: Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc as part of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, as well as the investors of a few other states, it was granted the status of a so-called “ground-breaking investor” under the Convention.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the quiet ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea bottom is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea bottom.
"You can convey there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich finding site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” says another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such concreteness as a pattern.
It reminds of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the fabulous scheme that brought to life the legend of the Golem.
German special forces were on the spot for the same freeing of geese
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special forces were ready, but they did not come to deploy.
The circumstances of the liberation of eleven abducted European tourists in Egypt are becoming more and more known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the aircraft squad of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as logistics experts of the Technical Aid Plant were at the site of liberation.
However, as spokespersons for the ministries continued on Monday evening, German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers left their prisoners running and fled when they had noticed signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve them as supportive forces on the ground.
“Fortunately, it didn’t happen,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
Attackers had kidnapped the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the abduction in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been destroyed.
The identity of the hostage holders remained unclear until last, as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information about when they would return to Germany.
According to the Bild newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are expected to fly out with an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of Congress has failed the $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones roared into the depths.
With 206 to 227 votes, the House of Representatives rejected the government’s rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all appeals from US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the advocates had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on MPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was worries of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, to then collapse again, after being known of the failure.
Experts are now expecting further serious turmoil in the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers have seen an increase in booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
With travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study – even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the travel desire of Germans remains unspoilt, according to one study.
In the bookings for the winter season, the rice offices recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the previous year’s period, as the German Reiseverband (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
For example, the sales increase of travel agencies in October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The basis for these findings is the numbers of the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates them highly for the overall market.
This includes the travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the United States is in particular in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the booking increase amounts to about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the local fields are particularly in demand among the Germans.
In particular, package trips were high in the course, DRV President Klaus Laepple said.
Given the rising costs of energy and food, the costs are "better calculable for the customer than for individually organized holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months were also very well booked, so sales will again increase compared to the previous year, although according to another study the number of Germans who undertook a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres ski hits in the endless loop, beer from liter bowls and celebrities in designer dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t have much in common.
She is blonde, a television presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: hardly three minutes on the meadow, the photographers already jump on us and knips the memory cards full - very flattery and that on my first meadow visit.
This is how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the White Sausage Equator, the feeling of well-being in the costume remained to date limited.
But once we arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything was half as bad.
Almost everybody wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassingly touched - everything completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate bananas stand only harvest my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman draws me attention to the fact that I had wrongly tied the apron: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back widowed."
I'm freaking my loop from the back to the left.
“Well,” he said and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch the naked back toward an uninvited one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-stretched "ooooo".
He tells me that after he gets rid of his previously drunk measures.
Right next to one of these hydrants that everyone thinks is a garbage bin.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild biesers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, medical workers run in crowds over the square, who have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the rooster - always four at a time drag a covered wearing from tent to tent.
It works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, fully back.
Whoever is under the plane in the Promille Sarg is not seen.
"These are the ones where goarnimer pack," one of the medical officers called to me upon request and disappeared in turmoil.
The name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for suspicion of slight driving.
In the meantime, he was released on deposit.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey’s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits rittlings at the end of the platform with a tower at each corner of the front and looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is destroyed.
But once you are inside the curved ticket desk, there is no doubt about the sublimity of the project, whose most western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a delay in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to implement the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia, to dominate.
However, Germany’s imperialist plans did not work during the First World War.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces pulled out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artistic roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly decayed, largely overlooking history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and all east of it, to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tukia.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, generated by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of approximation.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the fundamentals of this new foreign policy, I went on the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the ACP’s leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a rough ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city for the new secular state plan to turn back on the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has sparked a lot of distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a specially made, ultra-modern stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first businesses of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception,” he told me.
Turkey had been cut off from its background.
Nowadays, they have to look both east and west.
There would not be either one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to decide?"
“Turkey,” he said, “would not have to face this decision.”
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the embassy seems to be, in a broad sense, Europe as a whole can travel on the same railroad railroads eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha’s train station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German gentlemen, Mr. Knight and Mr. Conu, who had watched this building 100 years ago.
How surprised it would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting at the dock for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time at least there seemed to be no doubt which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley (September 11th recall) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir Proteus the following year.
He was intended for teenagers up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang in 1979 for the last time some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to take on any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young chorus was often amazing, always exciting and consisted only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that for years never ceased.
How many times death tried us to "let the music speak for itself."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never heroic but never overwhelming.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I have never been disappointed by one – often I have been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "gone to dwell with one or two well-known sparkling horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his aftermath for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman Research Scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a PhD degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published as "The British rubber industry" in 1958.
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 under a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew me to their attention for their simplicity and for the power they radiate, as they always deal with respect with the protagonists.
An exhibition that showcases many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda launches the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large-scale sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, the technical subtleties enable even more comfortable driving and saving gasoline.
Changes before the forthcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made with this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before starting to analyze the new model, it must be said that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second sales market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales truck in Spain.
In reality, the brand leaders hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22.000 models, which is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this proportion, Honda is relying on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models annually around the world.
According to market estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
Insight’s appearance on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, its first public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4-litre gasoline engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-litre gasoline engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, apart from additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The second generation of jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model has 2 versions of the gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows for low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time delivers high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 litres achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1.
This gasoline engine - Jazz's predecessor model reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
In terms of the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Bee' that avoids collisions
To drive the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature, more specifically, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is due to the bearing behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
The engineers from the Technical Development Center of Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see at an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly uninterruptedly in its personal airspace without interruption.
To replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are at a distance of up to two meters in front of the BR23C and in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a signal to avoid collision.
At the moment when obstacle is noticed, the little robot will mimic the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels by 90o or even bigger angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other system is that this avoidance maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it did not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither deviate up or down, nor can it override; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions to help the small robot avoid collisions.
`This device only takes a couple of seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres performed to store, so it can work continuously with only a couple of dozen KB of storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of the technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce to the series vehicles over the next decade.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and hold longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a satellite GPS navigation system to lead to the destination while driving, avoiding obstacles on the way.
She is trembling before she gets burdened with a mortgage.
One must realize that the U.S. Department of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid US citizens getting involved in mortgage stories of allegedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for internet surfers: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or perhaps, the ‘hotel of bad loans’ or mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, twice and up to three times if it is time to ask for no loan.
And especially where you can do it, which is also probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but no details.
This is more a site for teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What happens if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG)'s entry into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong fall in its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at the uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is below 19% of the stock price as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible stocks, which will secure a 10% profit and can be sold again at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global business will be based on a uniform average price of $29, or 28% above the current price value.
However, the Morgan Stanley share fell by 6.79% to $23.07 from 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, enabling it to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The rules presented Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the last few days: last Monday Morgan simply declared that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
`A week ago,' said Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG in Tokyo, `we thought that the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves."
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay for its Morgan Stanley shares 7% below their price value.
And the deal will go with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares if the latter is exchanged more than 50% above the sales value within a given period, i.e., about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds supplied by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a press spokesman for the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After investing in MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a debt rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said he had “significantly reduced” his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group who had to watch their stock exchange price fall by half, while the price for insolvency insurance rose to the level.
This price dropped on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that they had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around the 21st Century Socialism was re-established.
This is the joint plan of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
That third was the one who, following the example of his like-minded and friends on this Sunday, put the plan for a new constitution to the election.
Mission fulfilled, because according to public results reaching 80% of voters, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% were void.
In order for the bill to be passed, more than half of all votes must be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the outings of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for `Yes', and prophesied to it 63% to 70%.
In the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa called for the victory of his constitutional draft.
The “constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way,” he had insured in Guayaquil, the headquarters of the government, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence according to the Organization of American States (OAS) Observation Section, referred to a text of 444 points to secure the “new socialism” for which the President is advocating.
The constitutional draft transfers the power of the state to the economy by giving it the exclusive right to "development planning" in a country that lives largely from oil production by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange that sends emigrants to the country.
The project, driven by Correa elected in 2006, also grants the Head of State more broad power, who will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad.
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, held in the desert for eleven days, were returned healthy and intact to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
In good condition, the hostages reached the military base of al-Maza right next to Cairo’s international airport at around 3.30 a.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to talk to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a neighborhood of foreigners in Cairo, to be examined there.
They enjoy all "best health" and the kidnappers "was not paid ransom," Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the roller counter.
After being captured on September 19 in an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hideout to the next by 35 unknown hijackers.
They are 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and also eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus Agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, from board two helicopters, launched the attack at night just before dawn.
“Both sides shot and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,” said the official, who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomats, Franco Frattini, reported from Belgrade, where he is currently, on the role that intelligence agents and elements of the Italian special forces played.
"We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence services and the special forces," he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the evening before, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a patrol vehicle in which the kidnappers were located, killed six of them, including the Chadian leader, and arrested two.
The army declared that they were associated with a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which immediately denied that movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is headlines and a central topic of the current election campaign.
It's so much better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that famine?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and culturally important buildings?
That there are no laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides 3.5 million euros solely for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MPs, and all government districts, by mutual vote.
In Quebec, the association of Quebec’s historical societies, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical societies strive to deal intensively with history, with a few groans to save the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when sponsors and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states want to take the arms of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been in turbulence due to the US financial crisis: the three states make available a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have been consulting at the highest level this weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission’s Competition Authority’s representative.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has lasted for a year, so decisions that are now being made in connection with the bank could be precedent.
In the light of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank for about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell some of its shares, especially the insurance activities purchased by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis shares started a steep downturn last week, with serious crisis scenarios already occurring in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too large for a bankruptcy.
The institution’s securities fell by 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the stock value has declined by more than two-thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the management.
According to the management, the $700 billion US rescue package is expensive and the uncertainty in the markets caused by the drop in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the rates increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the Bank’s new Director General.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find an interested person with a factual offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down – no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
No panic has erupted among the customers so far, the bank’s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has separate branches, but it also calls it its own leasing companies.
Fox in the chicken shop
Due to a person’s drug use, life and health insurance in America often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts worry that the data market could become uncontrollable.
“There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we will trust the Fox the Chickens," said Richard Dick, the developer of the prescription data tracking program.
Insurance companies determine the fees and the amounts of withdrawal in the event of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and if the risk is estimated too high, the insurance is not at all concluded.
Previously, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was only concluded on the basis of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more affordable method: using the customer’s identification number, he obtains the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e. which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from what illness the customer is suffering from and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medications, it could be concluded that his blood fat levels are untreatably high, which would automatically place him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so the insurance companies just have to do the paperwork more, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as for migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the above-mentioned ones are not.
For the query and processing of the data, own companies have formed, which, before referring to the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not been punished so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory surveys and link them to data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
While there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities can also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned is hardly able to prohibit access to his data, as otherwise the insurance companies do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global dining schedule from Marseille
EU and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are both sides' leading trading partners, this was the main topic among other global issues at the ninth summit.
Today also takes place the French-Indian Summit, which discusses mainly cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging, democratic great power that should be given more votes and voice when it comes to international concerns, Member States have so far been unable to agree whether to support New Delhi’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomate Javier Solana received Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, an agreement to double trade to more than 100 billion euros in the next five years.
Given the fact that trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In that sense, the 26 existing civil flight agreements with India have also been legally consolidated into an agreement, so that air transport will continue to be boosted in the future.
India intends to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the pact.
The goal is to achieve a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked nine among the EU’s partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the call for a UN conference was urged.
The Doha round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU emphasized its commitment to its energy and climate programme, meaning that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed with this, as well as with the proposal to reach a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian leader visits the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion are expected to be made for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries to attend the present event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Properties and Cultural Activities, will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 square meter exhibition room "Punto Italia".
Then a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair will follow: on this occasion, numerals, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth division.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's Disappeared Small Aircraft Retrieved A Year Ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, a billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a high plateau of 3,000 m altitude, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
Inside the aircraft, however, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson completed the last doubt during a press conference: "The plane has been located, and a troop was sent to, and now we have the assurance that it is the plane that Steve Fossett flew with on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Traffic Safety (Ntsb) noted that a few hours after the aircraft was seen, a crew was sent to identify the aircraft: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett took off in Yerington, Nevada on a 3-hour flight.
Yesterday, some of Fossett's personal items were also found in California, close to the border with Nevada, by a couple near their home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two identity cards named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to circle the world balloon in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover.
Among his many records is a 15445 m high flight over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
A Suv that falls from the conventional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the unloading surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector with this off-roader.
It is precisely due to its exceptional characteristics that the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen at the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – a novelty in the automotive sector in retarded Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in different barrels that will occupy the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its nearly real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car appears to emerge from the poster on which it is pictured.
Then, using the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments to assemble again as a whole.
Without a doubt, Mercedes’ concern with this advertising is to introduce a new kind of authorship into this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in annoying the interest of future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls that all Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling after the Italian national team for years and which, honestly, until recently, has not caused any serious problems.
There have never been clashes with opposing fans so far.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia encountered these in Sofia.
They wear the tricolors on which the militants’ cities appear, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was a collision with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, 144 cards were provided to the Italian fans for the game: all were issued in names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those travelling to Sofia, no one was with a ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi in the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Luckily.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitators who could follow this slightly more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and that in no way gives such behaviour the opportunity to justify," the Viminal says.
Therefore, "eyes on especially also looking at the match of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, in Puglia there is a small core of the Italian ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sport Supervisory), on Tuesday, will gather the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services dealing with the problem of stadium power.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (significantly without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Before that, Mazzilli was the police chief of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, comes from.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise Duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds Osservatorio No. 1, “crimes are punished in the country of their crime.
Until now, this group had stayed in the clock, but now it is necessary to reconsider what has happened and what is going to happen.
But let us also talk about the peppers during the hymn of Mameli: even this is not a crime, but let me, because there is no education...”
