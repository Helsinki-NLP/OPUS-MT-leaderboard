What's going to happen? CSSD doesn't know about Voldemort or pastries in Prague.
New CSSD elected officials in the capital’s town hall will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier to understand each other at the city council level with their old and new SDG colleagues.
The newspaper Actualne.cz has "tested" the new members of the city council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the argot that was born in the last few years at the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that led in Prague.
The codified vocabulary that the political cream of Prague launched during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was surprised that it was discovered that the newly elected officials did not understand very well the terms known.
At least they say so.
"Who is Valdemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm a faster in Prague politics," said Lukas Kaucky, the culture elect at the test of the "sponsor's" vocabulary.
And as for the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole".
"This is the only expression among those you propose to me that I use."
Otherwise, I don't use the argot.
From the vocabulary, which the newspaper Aktualne.cz published in June of this year before the pre-ectoral congress of the SDG, the editorial selected 6 examples, priority those related to the city hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry shop, "beef nerve", "betrayal of the capital" and "enclosure".
Three of the elected officials agreed on the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who will lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
Fifth elected Petr Dolinek has completely refused the test.
"I don't take care of these things at all and how the representatives of citizen democracy are having fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand each other as part of our programs," he said.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would apparently not recognize in the legend above, that it is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky says and immediately adds, "But I know it from the newspapers."
“I’m going to have to pay for a language lesson,” he jokes.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of "going to the pastry".
"I think it's going to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it's the headquarters of Janousek companies.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers than from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no lexico of argot in social democracy.
“I’ve consulted with colleagues and it seems that we really don’t have something like that.”
“It’s rather the names that we sometimes use abbreviations and symbols,” says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Social Democratic Party, which members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza in school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Brezina said.
The newspaper Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the Party members or the least friendly Little Old Man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the scams during the party's sponsoring, is nicknamed "the little toy".
The nicknames are also the only ones that the Social Democrats admit to employ within the party.
It is heard that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear Hulda much, but the newspaper Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in Matrack Law" recalls that Petr Hulinsky has obtained his title of Doctor of Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "wizards," a brochure published.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common traits.
They are rather part of the older generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a "wizard" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
“Man rarely has this destiny.”
“Young women are also not judged healthy because they participate in work and give birth to children,” says a sister who works in Burkina Faso’s capital, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help limit witch hunting.
The case has a "hic".
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read,” Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil they sprayed to her.
It was the BBC server who transmitted this information.
The criminals say it was the evil eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves for ritual anointing has inflamed at the contact of the woman.
The oil flared, it seems, when the team wanted to "hunt the evil spirit" of the woman.
Isolation of "wizards" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: “Human spirit eaters have always been a danger,” he says.
While Burkina Faso is striving to reduce witch hunting, Gambia has even seen the President himself participate in it no later than last year.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after his aunt's death, launched a broad hunt for witches which, it seems, would have been involved in his death and would have been endeavored by the black magic of killing the President as well."
"Shamans from nearby Guinea who came to rescue brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the President's personal guard, randomly chosen men and women in villages in Gambia," Amnesty International said in a message.
At the farm, people imprisoned had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects that in addition caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The pooles warm, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out through the customer center door of RPG Byty company of the "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He had under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, the one of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2+1 second category apartment 4100 crowns.
“And there’s no hot water and heating works on solid fuel,” he said on his son’s new contract, the man who has the power to sign.
"But I signed it anyway," he explains angryly and half-resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Citizens' Association, which described the current rental conditions as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, when a notice will be published to explain the method to follow to claim.
But the man reacts to this with a hand gesture.
“One says that, the other says something else” by scratching his eyebrows.
The Ostrava region became the laboratory for deregulation.
After New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic await whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz has therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of the four in the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 9 am.
Right next to the door stands a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "rent 2011", is turned on on the touch screen.
A single press and a paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" as your number already begins to illuminate on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second, it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to inquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people in more than 44,000 RPG apartments have been receiving mail with new lease contracts in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers rent increases from 15 to 38 percent.
The special locker for new rents has been open to the public since November 18.
"It's been working for almost a week, so it's still testing," replies, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the box office when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deragulation and the old miner apartments in Bakal are a very sensitive local topic.
The Vice-President of Parliament and native of the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this in a fairly sustained manner before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
“Twenty years later, I want a new floor.”
"They didn't even change me a put...n board in the toilets, is relieved in introduction the man mentioned.
However, these are mostly, according to employees, retirees who come to make sure they will receive a return on the new rent price if they sign now as RPG promised in a special offer.
This is a reimbursement of half the rental amount that will be received by other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" box on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," the employee said at the box office.
And yet RPG puts individual interviews on rents on both its website and in the windows when necessary.
If the two parties do not agree on the rent, it is an independent court that will make the decision.
“These are not threats, but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally,” RPG said on its website.
"Here no one will go to court," thinks one of RPG employees Byty and the man on the street in front of the customer center gives her right.
“I have 13,000 crowns of retirement and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don’t have enough to go to court,” he said.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one signs and therefore people are waiting," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"Moreover, current rents still don't reach the level necessary for simple housing fund maintenance," says Pavel Klimes, director of RPG Byty's residential portfolio, which is precisely the housing fund's negligence that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the rent increase.
However, in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with rents to invest in apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 this is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging on the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room on Havirosvka Street, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
"The rent increase in 2011 is 15 percent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 percent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month," the screen said.
The 38 percent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
“In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns per m2,” adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2,600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
She adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see the graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The kindergarten is also one of the offices that included the architects.
the Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini kindergarten with everything you need - colourful walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectural project company Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini business nursery since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
She employs about 90 people, especially childbearing age, and she cared that women architects and project managers could quickly return to work.
Along with reduced-time employment contracts, kindergarten is a bonus offered to its employees by the Arch. Design company as part of its social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine a careful work for children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design themselves who imagined this kindergarten and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini kindergarten is funded from the European Social Fund through the Human Resources Operational Program and the Czech State Budget.
Thanks to the funding allocations (up to 2.8 million Czech crowns). They were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years to ensure qualified personnel as well as start-up.
After the use of the funding allocation (two years) the company Arch. Design. has an obligation after 3 years to operate the mini kindergarten on its own funds.
The project prepared for a year and it was the Economy rating company that helped apply for staffing.
Children's care is provided by qualified staff, all day a nurse and a nurse care for the children. children can go to kindergarten without age limitation but they are over three for most.
As this is a "mini kindergarten" there can be only 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more that replace each other.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although it is concerned with individual care and education, the mini kindergarten program is comparable to that for preschool education.
The children are not only playing, but quality education is also ensured - from the beginning to the preparation for school benches, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and do not have the stress of a delay in going to pick up the children in a school away from the parents' workplace.
Parents use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus listed among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for recruiting new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens HR marketing.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric Saurian, the staircase to a dinosaur spine and the balconies to open mouths of fish.
This is how it is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house has received the nickname of Bone House from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colours, unusual use of stones, tile fragments and mosaic, façade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present curves, this is all that is ypic for the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The front façade of the house unfolds its dream lines, its pleasant colors and textures that recall nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see geometry, rhythm and precisely thought order.
In the night the façade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced by it.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measurement.
The wood waves the window frames, balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyeliner and the lamellae.
The Battlo house which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia at number 43, was born from the construction of a 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first emphasized the demolition of the old building and the construction of another brand new, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-home house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol was working with him.
It is precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the façade are born.
For the façade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
Locals nicknamed the hot house just after its finish because of its organic shapes "the Bone House".
Others, considering the specific mechanism for opening the windows, called it "the house giving".
It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of St. George the patron of Catalonia.
Other building sculpture elements contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi has thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time,with ventilation fans and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely failed to comply with the construction guidelines of the time and was not allowed to be hampered by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained the building permit from the city, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the completion the city council was horrified and demanded changes.
For example, municipal council members did not like that the building pillars were intruding on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the city call Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented at a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which one accesses to an independent roof terrace.
All straight angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of space linking.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the lounges and the high company can communicate comfortably or limit private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with Gaudi's reconstruction has received in addition to new façades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi’s play with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which the inner courtyard is decorated and with the wells of lights.
The two-color game gives maximum light in every floor of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house, which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund, may be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative business and they expanded the scope of visits to common areas and the attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really inexpensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entrance price in Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic towers, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a summer: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the area reserved for bed, so the mattress and the summer give a real basis for a good bed.
Of course, they must complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During choosing several things are decisive,:weight, height, age, health status as well as the gender of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the summer are to be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where one does not sleep continuously, latex mattresses are not suitable because they "heat" gently.
In addition, they have a weight greater than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain, in addition, on a solid board, they retain moisture.
Habit is also decisive in choosing.
Anyone who spends the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses with a softening layer are frequently used will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
“That’s how all hokeyists who come back from the NHL complain that they can’t sleep there.”
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed a mattress with a sluggish layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that thus poorly assume the "information" of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczykova, who specializes in padded furniture.
This is why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses, for example.
You don't need to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This “miracle” simply works.
It optimises its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing is putting pressure on you and you won’t turn around at night like after a tough match.
You just sleep better.
Lazy foam also functions as a protection against squares.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a height of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220cm.
The minimum width for each for a two-seater bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
This is convenient in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should lay your hands comfortably with the elbows slightly folded. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-Mattressers and Decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the issue of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture.
For a two-seater bed each needs his own summer and mattress, so be careful, however, when choosing the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to mount the summer to different heights and this is not possible on all bed frames.
The foam mattress should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the spring mattress at least 15 cm, from this count for the layer of shape and ventilation at least three centimeters.
“When touching or sitting on the mattress, you don’t have to feel the springs,” warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-determined type of summer.
The sleeper bed, when the mattress and the socket are united like Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very bad; it should not be washed, which is commonly done at the Hourd today.
And since during the night we normally sweat 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to recall a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this the specialists refuse to make a claim for a lifetime of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
Everything to her but.
And for this an experience advice from the sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, give up, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though today it is common to make zippered coatings for the whole set, that is to say that after the opening we have two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise handling for large models (and for only one person) becomes when they are removed a fight between a lightweight and a heavyweight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a summer?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are no) with aeration holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with springs in bags (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an aeration layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type.
For single-position lamellae with 14/18 lamellae, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more lamellae, 28 and above, where the lamellae are lined in the lower part of the kidneys and so it is possible
For mattresses with multiple positions, it is not necessary to take a spring mattress as it does not respond to changes in position.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the lamellae, a so-called shoulder cradle can also be installed.
This is a special bond of the lamellae which makes it possible to press or even tilt the lamellae so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For men who have “the shoulders as wide as the back,” this is really an important thing.
This is already considered by mattress manufacturers who for "male" have begun to use a softening area at shoulder level.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the level of the hips.
For the most difficult customer, there are winged or plated sockets with what is called a multiforce suspension.
The pressure spreads to more points and dilutes the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and swollen with air) on good mattresses and summer, the "more" disappears.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow should support the head and its tips should reach only the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm which the Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the pillow must upgrade the shoulder height (with the shoulder cradle of the socket or the area of the mattress).
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first straw and grass-based mattresses.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also on the organic mattress.
Raw materials based on petroleum, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
“The Bio mattress qualification means that the heart is made from natural products,” explains Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop fragrances from the forest or lavender.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the birch plant extract so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" the man, the coatings "heat" women.
The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weak sex.
Current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cellular structure therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, lower back and feet are located.
You will pay for a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, it was Gumotex that reached the first place.
Saving for the mattress and the summer is not easy.
From time to time, two mattresses can be made by manufacturers or producers for the price of one.
As for example the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
The second one can obviously be taken for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a large thickness has been started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
This started as matter for NASA because astronauts were experiencing huge load factors at the start.
The Tempur shrinks at heat and, on the contrary, hardens at cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes optimal pressure to it.
It is ideal for this against sleeping badness and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and the venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or the same type.
Devices to track people are increasingly demanded by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child makes more and more people think about watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can just as well be used to trace the movement of people and help in some cases as for example that of little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as large as a box of lighters but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they started looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
“We strive to tell everyone that this is not spying, but just another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of MAcro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in a person's bag who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
“The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes the "box" is used and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws the attention that if the child does not want to wear something of this kind on him, he will get rid of it.
“Even the smallest can show great creativity when it comes to explicitly getting rid of something when they don’t want to be under control.”
“Cell phones, which can cut themselves like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations,” Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in case of aggression is very questionable.
"If this is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything possible to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate him."
“Right now, it’s the phone.”
“As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (the criminals) will also look for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign.”
"In such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She nevertheless admits that such devices can help in an unprepared assault by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an aggression.
"The apparatus may be configured in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period of time."
"In the event that the device is destroyed, it still remains the last position of the person concerned."
“The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slid and finds himself in the lying position without moving,” Cech says.
According to him, so-called smart cell phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special prosoftware.
The problem with current tracking systems is that they are either a device similar to the ones wear in the size of a light box pendant or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"It will have the advantage that the potential aggressor will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he will realize it after a while, which will have given the police a little more time," he added.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as tracing cars.
This is a combination of position acquisition systems using GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could travel around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense had bought 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the cords is two to four years maximum.
The army bought detonator cords from the STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff gave as reason for the massive amount of detonating cords to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES has contacted, it is apparent that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosive exercise each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defense, and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the annual military consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
At this distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army's reserves could sustain it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient for more than 2 m of detonating cords, as experts say, this means that the army with its new purchase has assured - with the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the Quick Response Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their fist weapons and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We are not talking about the lack of body linen.
"And I don't think if they buy such a large amount of detonating cords from us."
“And that’s their decision and they really know what they’re doing.”
“For us, the army is a good customer that we strive to satisfy as merchants,” said STV Group Chief Commercial Officer Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of kilometers of detonating cords will be destroyed by the fact that the army will have these "munitions" in reserve for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group reports, however, that only four years of life for detonating cords and the two-year-old police and army pyrotechnicians.
"If they are perfectly stored in the deposits, it can go up to four years," said one of two who does not want his name to be published in view of the military's criticism.
The past lifetime, each ammunition must be tested to see if it remains integrity and does not threaten the soldier's life.
These tests, however, are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to the quantity for 445 km of detonating cords.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's 245-kilometre supply," said spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the defense ministry's buyers' opinion.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonating cords of the police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always order only the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their lifetime.
This was established for the safety of pyrotechnicians and to be able to more flexibly obtain more modern and reliable types of detonator cords.
The Ministry of Defence today has serious problems with the neutralization of dozens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, heading onto the Rhine.
What is waiting for in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: to neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "inexpensively".
So far I have benefited from the contacts I have obtained thanks to the contests.
The franchise sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun well for the winner of the Best Individual Entrepreneur contest.
The winner of the contest for best individual entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure toward success is like in a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a lack of a quality hosting site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned when working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of five apartments half demolished.
Knowing that he was still a graduate student, it was a courageous action.
“The relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something,” says Lucas Pytloun.
He began renting the first rebuilt apartment to foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building that he transformed into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Liberec 4 guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all types of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year there was another one of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise showed up," the number one entrepreneur last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the contest of the Entrepreneur of the Year has served well," adds Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the streets, congratulated me often and, I have to say, it was very nice,” he recalled.
He recommends participating in this competition to anyone who strives to do something.
It is not necessary to win but every opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he's still using his contacts and knowledge that he couldn't have obtained in any other way.
"With those I met thanks to the contest, I started maintaining commercial relations regularly.
According to him, success-related reputation has also had an impact on employees.
And it's about 70.
“I observe in their homes above all the loyalty and pride of engaging in something that has been generally recognized.”
“This is not, by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
“Only my name is pushed forward,” says Lucas Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successor a better year than that we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been rapidly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the objective of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came to pick up the prize from Slovansky dum for the first place in the Competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it turned a tooling workshop in Ceska Skalice into a firm with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
“I can say that the award has not only encouraged me and my employees and increased our self-confidence in fighting competition,” said the winner of last year’s competition.
At the beginning of the history of the company Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state proposed to Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the little workshop as compensation after the communists' confiscation of property, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades around his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they began to specialize in plant oil presses.
It became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized audience after success obtained in the contest through the media.
“Not only our customers started to really get to know the Farmet brand, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that achieved the greatest success in their home country,” says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year did not pass at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's assessment was based on the economic outcomes of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, societies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their purchases of new materials and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped this situation."
“Revenues have fallen by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even dismiss it,” says Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that, from time to time, unpopular action needs to be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and retained profitable results even if they were inferior to those they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued to invest uncompromisingly in research and development.
"We built a training and research center with the staffing, strengthened the company's presentation at international exhibitions and won the main awards at national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of affairs rise, and with them the number of employees also.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a quiet atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes nonsense regulations.
The Absurdity of the Year investigation is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been deleted.
The unglorious winner of this year's Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring to the offices documents that officials can obtain online.
More than one-third of the 4,000 voters voted for this.
For example, social affairs administrations requested a paper excerpt from the trade register while the grievor can get it in two mouse clicks.
This changes through the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the excerpt from the trade register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fulfil in the Czech Republic and to eliminate those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the Absurdity of the Year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has still greater popularity.
If last year 3,000 voters demonstrated, at least 4,000 this year brought their votes.
And it's not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only hinder the company, and,this, more and more.
“We may be in the number of documents to be completed for tax returns at the top in the world,” says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a goal proclaimed by all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, 8 more places compared to last year.
The Absurdity of the Year Competition was established for the first time in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurds every year from April to the end of September, the last deadline before the competition closes.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "antiprix" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that has received the most votes is declared the winner.
Until last year's last survey, it's about a hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decrees that have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs as well as professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore, among the nominees is, for example, the obligation that motorway and highway maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with twenty employees, repay two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which still begins in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which political and public personalities regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
“Economic prosperity can’t work when the state puts sticks in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this my goal is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a sword shot in the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to report three days before the office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was removed with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most acclaimed obligation in 2007, which was to declare to the Office of Labour a service trip for a foreign employee over 30 days, was deleted with the so-called Green Card Act.
Everything is ok until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year’s Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The objective of this contest is to support the reasonable and fair company.
“We want to support companies that monitor their company’s impacts on the environment and carry out socially responsible activities,” said Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile phone operator Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this contest, as in the case of the contest for the Rebel of the Year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 firm competition, organized by the firm Vodaphone, companies that have not succeeded with a single long-term goal for the company have registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspiration and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from one another, their supporting and forecasting activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one case, this concerns people with disabilities and their employees’ personal or health problems.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole of the Czech Republic, there is no example of the Prago pro-software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for 17 years.
The old papermaking plant in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of the employees, has obtained the title of Head of the Central Bohemian Region and ranked third in the region at the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, who won for introducing easier working hours and even decreased up to 35 hours per week on average and, this, without, proportionally, a reduction in wage.
The jury also awarded her the title because it prioritizes Czech manufacturers, supports ditoyen activity in the nearby environment and is concerned with the environment.
“We strive to recycle as much as we can to ensure that our business and administration have the least impact on the environment,” says Miluse Ryznarova, the company’s chief executive officer.
the company responsible IT Enlogit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has set up for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their home work and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
“We also support the Man in the Shadow Foundation that helps the local Roma community,” said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of the company.
In the latest rank is, also for its activities, a washing and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
“In our company we contribute to food, transport, skills and leisure,” says Joseph Strapac of the construction company Bruntal Czasch, winner for the Moravian-Silesia region.
All regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year contest were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category, who had responded to the enclosed questionnaire of the document for registration and sent it back to the organizer before August 15.
Poorly completed or incomplete responses to the questionnaire were withdrawn from the contest by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing firms had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition."
“Independent registration is not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition of the Firm of the Year,” said Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison&Rose.
At the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plzen, anti-corruption police have been arresting in recent days.
The detectives passed the handcuffs to the local contractor and real estate trader Lubos.
The latter had endeavoured to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a refund application in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
This one had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For now I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider crime in the context of a public tender and competition," said the head of the Prosecutor's Office of Plzen Antonie Zelena for the Pravo newspaper, knowing that it is forbidden to provide further explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police released this 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
To find out how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate on the basis of so little official information.
Asked by Pravo, the spokeswoman for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund said the police had actually carried out an arrest in Plzen in a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and under no circumstances an employee," she said.
The real name of the public competition according to Cerna is "Call to propose rights for land transfers under the Land Act" and is set up when several law-beneficiary candidates manifest themselves.
"These persons offer, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their entitlements to restitutions that must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
“According to the proposed rights, a ranking of buyers is set up and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights,” said the Fund’s spokesman.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information about the persons who had registered for the appeal and as he himself is also a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of entitlements to refunds, he had offered the field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And he was probably cashing out of withdrawal.
That would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above the FdT standards.
He appeared in the case of former FdT chief Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been edited.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place and place where the access area to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it risked putting the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay an additional 100 crowns monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay a surcharge not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will have to pull from their wallets as much as 100 crowns per month from January onwards.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply, and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be around 100 crowns per annum for households in apartments than is now.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices given the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
The gas increases moderately but of course at the time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the highest consumption.
We can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the largest municipalities that plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay for central heating almost 50 more crowns per month from January onwards, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 crowns per year.
For the inhabitants of Prague a 9 percent increase is being prepared for water and sanitation in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If rents do not change, Prague will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest compared to the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are rising 7.4 percent.
Rental prices will rise significantly, for example, in the 450,000 rented apartments starting in January, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns in Usti nad Labem almost 2,500 apartments, has decided to increase to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the further increase in rents will be brought to court by the company.
Regulated rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase by 10 percent next year.
The Czech children get drunk with rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts very gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and also exceptionally the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in the hospital for recurrence do not make the exception.
This results from the experience of physicians who encounter cases similar to the admissions of hospital children's departments.
“Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be drunk.”
"The trend is really strong alcohols," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Chief Children's Department of the Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chip a bottle of daddy into the cabinet, it's sometimes wisky but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail.
“Wodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not smell it,” explains the department chef.
Eva Jurinova, spokeswoman for Motol Hospital, also gives him right.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"Today it's fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivovice that they brought back from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the head of the Pélikan department, seeing drunk children aged thirteen to fourteen at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he worked for ten years in pediatrics, where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the wide surroundings completely drunk.
“A young girl was hospitalized four times.
"She started her career at twelve when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," the doctor wrote this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
“What’s interesting is that it didn’t seem strange to the mother that her daughter was absent for 48 hours,” said the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their unusual tolerance to the fact that their children are engaged in drinking that are the main causes of the development of children's alcoholism.
However, according to experts, there is no talk of dependency, in its strict sense, for children.
"Under the alcoholic wording we hear a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that arise from it but that is not found in children."
"At those who use acool repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavorable socio-family background," said Pélikan.
According to spokeswoman Jurinova, about forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the paediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with severe poisoning requiring hospitalization are integrated into statics.
Children who are drunk after emergency care brought home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, he exits according to Pélikan three seasonal waves with which one can count: Witch Day, St. Sylvester and the end of the school year.
“Either they drink after poor results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the holiday.”
"Of course I lived on Witch Day an admission of seven children drunk at once," Pélikan said.
The drunk child who spent the night in the detox hospital under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who went home and suffered the day after the "wood mouth."
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off for this because they have a great evening and then a sweet wake-up and nothing hurts them."
“They are only amazed at where they are,” adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it spoils patients’ good mood at least with the bill to be paid for their care.
Ambulance transportation and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"Occasionally, I have applied this as an educational means by telling these children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they could spend all summer in seasonal work to repay a single evening," Pélikan said.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their regressive management, which should recover care-related expenses from parents, do not deal with cases of drunk children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, for which the Ministry of Defense exchanged transport aircraft Casa C-295M, took off Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS is headquartered.
This is the first time that such aircraft have become owned by someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the course of exercises or demonstration thefts.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were so far in service in the Czech army and were in flight condition.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
These are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the firm Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Ministry of Defense’s press department, the physical departure of Vodochody’s planes is currently unknown.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft planned for exchange have been taken on long-stocked aircraft without causing additional loads or investments for the Ministry of Defense."
"The L-159 T1 two-seaters were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He said the army would not remain without two-seaters since the ministry signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody an agreement worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 cars into two-seaters.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of certain Alliance countries.
“In the contract it is clearly stated that the one who takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used to train pilots from NATO member countries.”
"It is therefore the case of the one who considers how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not tender and contacted EADS directly.
The defence management argued that the exchange ensured future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and used only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will likely have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been chosen as part of a European tender and under no circumstances by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of low cancer risk
Men who have the longer index than the annular are exposed to a lower risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This can depend on the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple prostate cancer risk test, especially for men before 60," said co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer testing, including by combining with genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eeles added.
During the period 1994-2009 she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right hand index shorter than the annular.
For them as well as for the 19 percent of those with fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the index longer than the annular, however, the risk dropped to 33 percent, for men before the age of 60 the risk decrease reached 87 percent.
The length ratio of the two fingers cited - formed during the prenatal period - indicates in particular different levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that helps in the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said for CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under snow, motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On the roads and sidewalks, there is most of the time compact snow, deblayers have worked all night in many places.
Highway D5 is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometers towards Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and highway D1 in Brno towards Prague is suffering the same fate.
The Central Automobile Club (UAMK) dispatcher told the information
At the 91st kilometre a truck was crashed, at the 93st two heavy trucks were hit, the accident injured.
Several cars also found themselves in the pit.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks were hit there.
The drivers should leave right after Brno at the 190th kilometre or go through Brno and then enter the 182th kilometre in Kyvalka.
A line of cars of several kilometers was formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague there is a snow layer of several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, lines of cars are created in Prosek, Sterboholska street is also stuck.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and the Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o’clock in the morning the Prague Crisis Staff is still to meet.
The railways and the airport also face problems.
The Czech railways have already had to remove 7 fast-track connections due to the snow.
The lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
Travelers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed from Wednesday 11:00 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rollable but doubling with vigilance.
On the Vyskov road, three side roads are impractical, on the Brno road it begins to be snow bursts in places and on the Blansko road the chains are mandatory to pass certain communication lanes in the places placed above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them you may need to send snow debris and snow strawberries.
It is not possible to estimate when they are rollable.
On the road to Hodonin caution is of rigor in the White Carpathian region.
On roads that are, in view of the protection of nature, only maintained by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warns CTK.
In Czechia it fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with, often, up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow was gradually disappearing in Czechia.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. military sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as the XM-25 code.
Generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and “will change the game” for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super precise gun.
Its projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly breaking explosive, actually functions like small grenades.
The ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode at contact with the target but also at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a gap.
Nor is it protected from above, and when a deadly rain of steel slices falls on it, it can put him out of combat as well.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon that uses "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends it a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtains a precise target point, according to which he corrects his target site and presses on the release.
"Let's say you targeted at 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the gun loads and shoots at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," Audette said.
400 relocated jobs
The Fujitsu Group moves its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer their workplace to Astro Park, which is currently located in the Mareinbader Square office building in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer manufacturing and maintenance giant said Wednesday, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, so far located on the Marienbader square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, an immense office complex located on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt’s Niederrad District.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together another 100 jobs that have been scattered so far in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and Astro Park’s open-air offices are better suited to employees’ working modes.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
CEO Bernd Wagner said: “Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with remarkable infrastructure.”
He claims that the airport connection is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company within the region yesterday sparked the joy of the winners and caused the losers to be disappointed.
The head of economic affairs of the Frankfurt municipality, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquered.
It is an “extraordinary profession of faith in relation to the place of implantation.”
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The management informed the municipality soon of this intention.
“It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly relationships could not have changed the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
In the end, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a matter of avoiding such an exceptional place to remain unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the Town Hall Square building, so far used by the Fujitsu company and the neighboring "small vertical", as well as the rest of the Marienbad Square buildings, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
As a result of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the railway station and the town hall, which sparked many criticisms, not only because of the impressive design of the areas that once used to be partly parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating and investment consulting company, Feri, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German Frankfurt-Specialized Immobilien-Chancen Group acquired the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund. A year later, these buildings were resold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group, headquartered in Tokyo, is considered to be the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the largest in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has many more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to move to Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were taken for rent in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses among others the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronics and Electrotechnical Industry.
Amazon's Server Expulsion - Threats Against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The internet service provider Amazon has expelled the site specializing in disclosing confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude perhaps hides the political pressure suffered after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Wikileaks founder Mr. Assange apparently lives in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with increasing force.
The cyber activist group "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its hosted server so far in America and is now looking for a hosting company in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is sought after by Interpol, is likely to stay in Britain, according to newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," cyber activists said Wednesday on Twitter.
Soon before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Following the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyberactivists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the most document access.
Wikileaks continues its revelations on Twitter: “Formidable, our dollars are now spent to take care of people in Europe.”
When freedom of expression is a problem for Amazon, “they should stop selling books.”
CNN, quoting Liebermann’s office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after Senator Joe Lieberman’s collaborators investigated.
The chairman of the Senate commission for the protection of territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, the British newspaper The Guardian reported.
"I wish Amazon would have taken this step sooner in view of previous Wikileaks publications of classified information," he said.
At the same time, Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, monstrously and scrupulously, putting our national security at risk and life at risk everywhere in the world," the independent senator said in a statement.
“No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks disseminate the content of stolen materials.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is being sought by Swedish authorities for suspicion of rape, is on the list of people sought by Interpol.
According to the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently called plots orchestrated by his critics the prosecution against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that threats have been made against the site.
“Appeals have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange.”
That’s why Assange fears especially for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the responsible for Wikileaks' revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, Chief of Government adviser Stephen Harper told television, obviously in an ironic way, that Assange should be “killed” and that Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, there was a controversy between the White House and Mr. Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ ridiculous and absurd” that Mr. Assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if she was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and recently disclosed, to engage in spying activities.
“I don’t know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of a website owner,” Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the assertions of a website."
The U.S. government is now completely passing the protection of its databases to the test bench.
According to a White House statement, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Counter-Terrorism Centre, was appointed responsible for fighting leaks.
Mr. Travers is responsible for implementing "the necessary structural reforms" made indispensable after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House is also willing to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the U.S. government has announced that it wants to deal with the security of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
“We have done our utmost to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
The University of the Ice
At the Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where does all the ice come from?
Glacier and ice machine.
The glacier, i.e. in German the somewhat outdated ice cream, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice cream.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window with a spatula, places it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The ice cream manufacturer founded the ice cream university in 2003 so that ice cream from its machines meet everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses on chocolate ice for several days are also offered and practical sessions are held in the private ice shop.
In the midst of the crisis of age 40, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, there were 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of arts education from California, is a fan of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a quality European product in the country of industrial ice in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a business management advisor and wants, after a few years, to draw something singular from this nervous profession.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian housekeeper came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
Determining not only is the good taste, but also silky flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a damn dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately cools down to four degrees.
He then opens a faucet installed on the machine: a pasteurized base white cream comes out, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream.
The trainer is immediately attacked by the question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr. Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
He who speaks only of ice cream "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers despite this: most often a natural product, for example from guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will chew nothing but ice pellets.
Some changes to the basic mass are allowed.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano makes the difference between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit or confectionery hall of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"Suppliers will all try to rebuild you dozens of flavored ingredients."
“However, you should just try.”
Either in the recipes of fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice cream made from white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when added cocoa powder, is the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different types of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
No more aromatic substances, no more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily have the taste of the nut, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice cream, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
“Only a balanced mixture properly enhances the taste of an ice cream,” says Luciano.
Making ice is a calculation exercise: if you use peach puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
Manufacturing ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as before.
It is not only the automatic basic mass making machine that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the available ice mixture is beaten simultaneously to make it oint and brought back to negative temperatures.
Despite all automations, slight failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbers himself with fruit puree from head to feet and thus splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal mixer bowl escapes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "a similar incident may occur during each class: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experiencing the cultivation of genetically modified plants has nucleated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the expert group Testbiotech, which is regarded as an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
“This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we learned well,” Christoph Then, Testbiotech Director, told Munich on Wednesday.
Some information reports that the chairman of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, as well as other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Pressure Group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has worked decisively on the development of EFSA testing requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest, according to Mr. Then's criticism.
The prescriptions elaborated correspond textually, in paragraphs, to the positions of the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the trade mark of the industry which, in essence, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma, Italy.
This is already the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period, changing her camp.
Not long ago, even the Central Germany Radio (MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the controlling authority of the European Union and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions both of the German Federal Agency for the Environment and of MEPs.
However, the EFSA does not admit any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, is used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from contacting this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This agency considers itself a neutral forum of experts in the field of science, industry and politics, among others, to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any feeding trials in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know, for example, what are the impacts of genetically modified corn caused in the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow for reliable results.
"If we don't look at the risks, how can we find them?" asked Mr. Then in an accusing tone.
This is also the point of view of Ms Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientist has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are hardly any researchers who are not connected to societies.
In the opinion of the companies, the critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck says that "the industry controls safety research".
The Trace of Stone
Uli Gsell obtained it, in total about 400 kilograms.
On Monday afternoon, she stood in front of the Stuttgart train station with her tube on her back.
There was maneuver.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators had come and started to demolise much of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Several thousands of people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost several billion.
Much of the wing was in ruins when the protests resulted in the cessation of construction works.
Breaked into 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier limestone) of Crailsheim, a soft and coarse pavement poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He obtained some fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They shouldn't disappear."
He declares with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly."
He claimed that by cutting it with the saw, he smelled cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The traces of the Stones of Stuttgart lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the landfill," he said in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was the subject of insults and threats when newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the northern wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for entire days with opponents of Project S21.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stone.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallelepipeds weighing an average of 80 pounds whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a memory in, while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
Approximately half is still packed up in the forest, with the rest being sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Private.
They came from everywhere and took everything they could get into the chest and trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long turned into "Mäuerle" or limitations of herb bands.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," said Mr. Rongen.
"It wasn't this political component."
He enters his off-road car, travels around his vast 20-hectare empire.
He studied law, which he abandoned, and later started studying biology before getting interested in computer science and eventually becoming a carrier.
And a stone lover.
It stores 40,000 tons.
It accumulates treasures throughout Germany.
He claims that he is the largest trader of ancient stones.
He's cooling down.
Sandstones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"Once they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
He shows a pile of his finger: Red sandstone, previously part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Joli travertin."
The parallelepiped was formerly part of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertin from the police prefecture, the red-coloured granite from the St. Blasian Cathedral, the tuf from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that once the stones were carved by hand and moved with simple hoists and wagons pulled by beef, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage was put into play."
He has not become rich, even less rich.
But today the carrier employs 14 people, and a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s rewarding,” says the waste recycler.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save, too.
Talent struggle to conquer the high potentials
The counter has a strong affluence.
16 students are coming to buy salmon rolls, tomato sauce and white-eaters.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students in design and mechanical engineering to a workshop.
As part of some kind of idea contest, they must talk trade about the car of the future with VW designers, and, by the way, know the company Volkswagen.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go body-to-body in competition to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates as much as possible in amphitheatres before they enter the job market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we are trying to identify and retain exceptional talent in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the automotive group amadoued the talents.
A young staff lady shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the calendar of professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the ways to access the group’s enclosure.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project engaged with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
“As for the Volkswagen Group, it can get to know the students, look closer at serious candidates and appreciate those who come into line as a collaborator.”
According to Mr. selle, such cooperation is unusual.
What’s new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
"In the past, the emphasis was placed on the professional project," says Mr Selle.
The struggle for the conquest of new graduates will become much harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting on a number of candidates.
But they must boast their reliability and, above all, court the highly qualified workforce.
These are especially graduates from the engineering sectors who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the VDI forecasts, the vacuum for engineering positions will grow further.
Roman Dykta goes to hunt talent on behalf of KPMG, an audit firm, accounting expertise and consulting.
It organizes expensive talent recruitment events, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors must find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel through the United States in this way.
Participants can access KPMG subsidiaries and know the company.
The person who must participate will decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Dykta, the means used to pursue high potentials in universities are becoming increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot through the cruise race."
“For us, a simple cruise was too little.”
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Until today, we have stayed in touch with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to address their requests to our company soon," he said.
Apart from the direct lean on campus, small and medium-sized enterprises proceed in a quite classic way by participating in the professional fairs where they engage in brain hunting.
"We are trying to reach graduates by participating in professional shows."
“For example, at the solar technology fair,” says Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Director at Solarworld, a manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company based in Bonn employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe is aware of the issue of the replacement.
Currently, 35 positions are being contested on the company's website.
“Right now, it’s very difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It’s expensive and takes a lot of time,” he said.
Another way to establish contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Freiburg.
"The teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to take professional internships or write his or her graduation project with us."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced by solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a large group can't do this," says Ms. Stübe, Chief of Staff.
Money hasn’t played a leading role in job searching for a long time.
Flexible working hours, child care or good opportunities for promotion are other key factors.
According to a study conducted by the institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The institute is an annual honours table for German employers.
To this end, he interrogates employees about their degree of satisfaction with their work and context while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
The Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the image of the company among job seekers.
"I think candidates rely primarily on external evaluations regarding a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy (DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means first and foremost taking internal action.
“The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through their own employees,” he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best messengers."
When employees are treated well and identify with the company, they advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing in an orchestra,” Mr. Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, the southeastern state of the United States, over the years to come.
The government of Washington issued an equivalent ban and thus definitively cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains for now prohibited.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced this on Wednesday.
This strict ban is due to the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April, which should remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this accident, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, said he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents of this solution thus want to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating black tide in the golf has not yet been definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces multi-billion demands for compensation, is at the center of charges.
A commission of inquiry created by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the freeze of the drilling decreed after the platform exploded.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and tighter security instructions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing thorough reforms.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would remove the profitable tax niches of the gas and oil groups.
Stakeholders in this sector are now publicly warning that the supply flow rate in the Gulf would be significantly lower than so far.
"The government's goal is to halt the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector," according to a current poll conducted in the sector by audit firm BDO, ahead of the drilling ban on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance regrets the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulations."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to further notice, at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing through the rivers is brown-oiled; it emits a smell similar to that in the gas station: Due to a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live from theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
“Don’t get exhausted,” the ecologist wrote to the journalists to calm them down: “You still have enough oil sludge in front of the water lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man engulfed in muddy water to his chest, as well as the oily trail around him: This scene looks almost beautiful in the rainbow-colored water shine.
It cannot be noticed that the basement is filled with brown sheets of crude oil.
On the shore of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells that she once collected shrimp by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil came from a pipeline that exploded in the huge marsh.
Fishermen living in the small neighboring town of Bodo now have to roam for six hours to reach the fishing waters: The Ogoni country in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire extent of the devastation jumps to the eyes when you walk through the mangrove marshes crossed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat splits brown water, and anyone who plunges his hand into it removes all the oil cover.
The roots of young mangroves emerge from the ground like laughing sticks. The isolated palm trees sadly let their palms hang.
The clouds of birds are searched in vain, as they are usually found in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a ghostly silence falls down on this old paradise that resembles a gas station by the smell it emits.
"What's happening here is war on the environment," Mr. Celestine Akpobari says with a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent health hazard."
The comparison of wars is made.
The Ogoni region is a battlefield besieged for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. this was later executed. In 1993, the Shell group had to discontinue its production activities in this region because they had become its own.
Even today, the return to the Ogoni country is forbidden to this company: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drill wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines throughout the entire Delta region, three times large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited for the unexploited situation there.
All the few hundred meters stand in the water of steel trees like bizarre sculptures: very affectionately "Christmas trees" are referred to as heads of drilling holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are gnawn by corrosion to the benchmark.
Akpobari estimates that a drilling head of this nature breaks down from time to time as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion litres have been poured into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that went into the sea during the crash of the superoil tanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the biggest environmental catastrophes in human history.
Who is responsible for persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider drilling head explosions and perforated pipelines to be the main causes.
In 2008, U.S. researcher Richard Steiner reproached the Shell Group for applying essentially less stringent safety standards to Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the rate of pipe failures is "still much higher than crashes."
Some forms of mangroves emerge in a place that, seen from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of camboys and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with camboys to the neck.
A fire shines under one of the many pipes that are sometimes connected to the pipes, sometimes scattered without motive on the site must be repaired: a small clandestine refinery.
The crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, Michael, the team leader, explains.
Initially, the gasoline enters a container passing through pipes, then, at the end of the pipe of the kerosene drops fall and finally diesel is obtained.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300-litre diesel barrels daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta inhabitants are taking advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 cents of Euro per liter of Diesel: because they purchase their raw material for free.
This is offered by the "protectors" that put the pipeline network in drilling throughout the Ogoni country, according to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very small portion of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally purified: The networks of organized crime, which also include high-ranking politicians and military members, charge the lion’s share in tankers and yell it on the global market.
Activist Akpobari believes that the debate on whether to attribute environmental catastrophe or rather subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
“If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen’s lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage, nor theft, nor illegal refineries.”
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was only about withdrawal from the group. "Maybe operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove better."
Then Michael gets nervous.
“It’s high time for you to unravel,” the robust oil worker announced.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at the most they will offer them bribes.
Even soldiers mostly from the north of the country intend to take advantage of the raw material, like all Nigerians.
“Of any point of view, this damn thing has brought our country down quite low,” Akpori said.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 is experiencing a serious security problem.
In examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic failure of the reactor."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
Earlier in November, passengers of the Airbus owned by the Quantas airline had apparently had more luck so far: During the investigation it conducted, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft were presenting a serious safety issue, and it warns against a possible construction defect.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue coves and leaks at the connection of the oil pipe, an ATSB administration said in a position statement published on Thursday.
It could have led to a “catastrophic failure of the reactors.”
This includes the Rolls-Royce reactors and 20 A380 series aircraft.
The airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land emergencyly on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now launched legal proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court headquartered in Sydney, giving her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas director Alan Joyce said his company would claim damages in relation to the incident in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, oil inflammation is the cause of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors now need to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ASTB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all stakeholders.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the airline Quantas had immobilized its entire fleet of A380 on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380s.
Lufthansa has replaced the reactor of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The two-storey plane is the largest airline plane in the world.
Snowfall across the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reigns on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
In winter, Germany is glowing: Due to icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow in the night of Thursday, leading to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, snow coverage reaches 15 centimeters in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff worked permanently, but they were unable to get rid of the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent bursts swept the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Bureau for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein to take place with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow clusters on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That’s why the bad weather alarm station Meteomedia announced the violet alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
In places, there fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxony-Anhalt land, police authorities have reported serious road disturbances.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused traffic disruption and plugs.
In Thuringia, snowfalls have hit the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disruptions in rail traffic have occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railroads, trees fallen on railroads, catenaries or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers of the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
Snowfalls have resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a standard spokesman and flight information, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport says 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no more passengers trapped at the airport, despite this, only 400 beds are made available to them.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday afternoon.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level passage.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was struck at a level passage because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made a barrel on a sliding road in Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists announce good news: snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will whirlwind in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to newspaper reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just embellished the group's headquarters: The twin towers in the Business District have been modernized; while bankers have had to return to their former place of service.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
This spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said, "We're checking if it's more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or sell them, and put them back for rent later."
Thus, the largest financial institution in Germany has already ceded its headquarters shortly thereafter.
It was only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for EUR 272 million from owners of equity and had subsequently rehabilitated them.
Transformations aimed at energy optimization have, according to some indications, swallowed around €200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, meanwhile renamed "Green Towers", at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesman, it is currently not known whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people are crying for the miners who have died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought for buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
The bodies had not yet been able to get up because the security situation of the disastered well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the disastered well, but no traces of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and the other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors had no chance of survival.
So far the bodies could not be brought up.
Today, relatives and friends have held a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth, south of the New Zealand island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which the names, headsets and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also had their place there.
The flags were deceived in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative celebration that New Zealand has nourished the hope that miners will come back to the surface.
"But they never went home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen has been buried in the pits, said he cannot resign to accept the death of his son until he has seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Miners of South African and British origin were also buried during the first explosion on November 19.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the Southern Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the masses of explosive gas are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the Splatter movie an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre through his film, "Walhalla Rising", the fighter's epic.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his bully and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero uses methods of humina's assault.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the burgundy says no words about his true name, and even the other characters escape, at most, in the departure of one or two sentences, some frightening screams of agony.
Otherwise, nothing is said and celebrated in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland, which is the setting of the universe of the Vikings, about a thousand years ago.
This would be ideal plus mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travelers.
When a film targets multiple target groups, it is a shame that they exclude each other.
The director Winding Refn has been regarded, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy about the fierce and stylish drug dealer, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and rehearsal cinema.
Most art cinema enthusiasts have to experience horror from the brain that spreads around and into the intestines.
Action film enthusiasts die from boredom, when the borrower boards, for reasons that can be interpreted freely, with a group of violent Christian missionaries on a ship toward Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that it only exists in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that deserved some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
These are not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream turned into a film.
The spectator cannot escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a lugubre soundtrack, but above all with an unseen hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blonde boy, who stands faithfully next to the boy, preserves some innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
More than anything, the stubborn hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at all times to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning himself into a warrior, is perhaps the envoy of the devil himself.
It represents rot, but perhaps also, only for those who are, anyway, rot.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which aims at annoyance, enthusiasm and amazement.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious groundwork
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications regarding a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone to submit to the agency’s controls.
In the night of September 5-6, 2007 at midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest nearby town is 30 kilometers away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in IAEA documents, as it is a question of the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the lack of electric current.
According to a briefing by U.S. intelligence services dating from late April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighboring town, el-Kibar, would be well-suited to produce plutonium, which would make it possible to manufacture atomic weapons.
However, this technique has been in use since the 1950s.
The CIA has shown a presentation video featuring blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, or even the inside of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, we have little more information than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery becomes more and more thickened.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built an el-Kibar reactor, but had little clues that the country was developing “an active nuclear weapons program.”
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about it and only speak of a “supported reactor”, even if they consider the presentation of the CIA to be “plausible.”
They lack tangible evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how he was ensuring that he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior UN diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer by stating that the IAEA had “sufficient documents to ask questions.”
The Syrians certainly precipitately removed the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen discovered traces of human-produced uranium at el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA has received satellite images from commercial providers from a member state showing the moment that followed the attack directly, which appears to be more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured that it has never carried out a secret nuclear program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus argues that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA rejected this argument after analyzing the particles, calling it unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused any discussion on this, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
Thus, the investigation into this case has continued since June 2008 without any results and is "becoming increasingly a serious problem of the Agency's credibility", as a senior Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna recognizes, ultimately it is a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Prohibition Treaty.
The IAEA considers that to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors have not indicated which facilities are here, what is their function or what is suspected to contain them.
According to information published by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also from the names of neighboring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington identified these locations and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that it is located on or directly next to a military base; this is exactly the reason why Syria refuses access to the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is claimed that Syrians fear that the inspection group would actually be spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military facilities.
Actually, it is an intelligence provided by U.S. secret agents that drew the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped to transport substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve fuel production."
It would not have "indications regarding sensitive activities, such as the enrichment and reprocessing of uranium; processes that are indispensable for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed to make the bomb would have been separated later.
It is not known whether the gravel, which could hide high-value traces, has been stored in all three sites.
When the hundreds of land-loaded trucks have disappeared, no one will have information on the place where the gravel is stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar across the Euphrates River, in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing satellite photos taken on behalf of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked them to the reactor in question.
However, satellite photos show that Syria undertook grounding work at the three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when IAEA began demanding access to these sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not helped discard suspicions.
In diplomatic contexts, the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for the inspections to be carried out there, enabling Syria to preserve possible military secrets, and only the time spent shows the great interest of the inspectors in the case.
Meanwhile, Damascus also disregarded this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been mentioning for a few months what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means the Atomic Agency has to implement its control.
IAEA Director Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he still hesitates.
This means involves a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council and many of the 35 countries represented there do not want to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, like that diplomat who gives to reflect: "Would it be useful if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in times of war
It has been bad since Angelina Jolie made her debut as a director in the summer.
She wrote the script herself: it's a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
Nothing else is known about this story, but this is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian bully during the Yugoslavian War.
The federations of Bosnian women immediately protested, and in response, some filming sequences planned in Sarajevo were displaced at the last minute in Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the Women's Victims of War Organization sent a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress.
She is not a diplomat, and a few weeks ago she proposed to these women to meet with them in Hungary, but they declined to offer.
"The meeting must take place in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in concentration camps, and Jolie's script tells a lot about her attitude to victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner to withdraw the status of ambassador of goodwill to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of script did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a filming authorization to Sarajevo after a few hesitation, but it is not known why it did not subsequently come despite that authorization.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that she has made a lot of effort to become aware of the Yugoslav conflict, and that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all stakeholders the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: Lovers knew each other long before the beginning of the war. They meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
Which still makes a big difference with the version "a victim of rape falls in love with his bully."
That Jolie's film started long before the war, of course.
The pressure put on it, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on erroneous information.”
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can bring him peace: by illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's go!
Tonight, everything is going well with the Irish again.
No trace of consternation.
This is why the local team overdominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy on the background of loud music, they trimble their feet.
Baileyu-Pub from Cork in Southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and succeed in dropping table tennis balls at a distance of three meters into the opposing team's beer cups.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong". The winner packed 500 Euros plus a plane ticket allowing him to go to Las Vegas in January to attend the World Beer-pong Championship.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the computer scientist reserved, these two behaviours really don't go well together.
And yet, despite that, the 26-year-old man is trying to have fun, to turn away from the tricky question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will lead hiring interviews in New Zealand.
"I have a strange feeling," he said.
“The home country is so far away and I have no job there.”
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Due to the dark prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their chance abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, resides in Sydney, her brother Colin now occupies a position of computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island resembles that of the tanners.
Experts at the Institute for Economic and Social Research say 100,000 Irish people will soon leave their country.
They even forecast a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts come true, it will be a current of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which Irish people enjoyed great ease, sadness now takes place.
The economic crisis, however, affects mostly young Irish people, well trained, who have so far only experienced moments of happiness.
The loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
In the meantime, three in ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times abundantly publishes readers’ letters written by young emigrants, who complain: “In Ireland, everything is going to drift.”
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the possibilities goes away and our country thus an entire generation.”
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students Union, sees a darker future because the government is just throwing dust in the eyes and offers no prospect for the future to young people.
“They cut minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” said the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cling from an unpaid practical internship to another.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to approach this theme positively.
McLarnon is hosting the WorkingAbroadExpo, which offers full support on the theme of “working abroad”.
"But work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for newcomers in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Her website shows photos of Australian surfers and snow surfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a trick, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e Germany.
A fashion house just comes out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional workstation, in order to be able to complete repaying the credit contracted to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after a long time.
“I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I almost no longer live.”
He bursts out of embarrassed laughter as he walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-kept front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access lanes.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 Euros, financed 100 percent by the credit.
"These were moments of madness, without a doubt, money was easy," he said.
Are you afraid to see everything collapse because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, drinks warm tea and says, "I don't have children to care for and I'm young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer doesn’t like the lamentations he’s often heard lately.
“No one should suffer from hunger, yet our situation is not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island,” he said.
“Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, perhaps that’s what makes us feel Irish first.
He laughs and then talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“He was back after spending seven years there and in Ireland, life just went on.”
This is a great idea for Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life goes elsewhere.
In his rankings, he already has a few years of work in London, which is why life in New Zealand should not be so easy for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him very much in recent days: the party to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He is afraid that he can turn into a goodbye night.
"Only not a lot of emotions," he said drinking a long sip of beer.
“Goodbye, it seems worrying.”
“Let’s rather call it a goodbye evening, all relaxed, gathering a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games.”
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does that for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it follows attitude changes in the region.
Two related elements emerge from the results of this year's poll, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the fairly sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp drop in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Approximately 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with how their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase over 25 per cent in 2001 (graph 3)
Around 34% said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but a sharp increase compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shaken support for democracy.
While this has remained strong during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have only suffered a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again dropped to 32% this year.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see graph 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translates into a widely shared sense of progress
This is rarer in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It is only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the biggest problem for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or their loved ones have been victims of a criminal act in the past year; nevertheless, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
Stronger economic performance is reflected in the rise in support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country back, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, decreased by 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country sinistered and in fear.
Voting boxes and a new vote were presented, voting ballots scattered in the gouttries, polling stations ravaged and intimidation
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatians, including many who were displaced following the January earthquake, wandered around the neighborhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and demanded the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations senior official in Haiti, views the event as "a fairly good election in many respects".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they did not "believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are owed to René Préval, an unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former First Lady, withdrew from their initial appeal to declare the vote null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no noticeable support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority to have reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a raging cholera outbreak, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there were fears that participation would be.
In the occurrence, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The stake is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet to the center
In the weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, enjoyed a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate by 20 points to more than 50%, her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on Ms. Fernández's choice, apparently mourning, whether or not she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to draw up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Mrs. Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into distress following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian struck one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to dispute,” the president said.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even more space to spend at will.
The economy is widely overheating: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions’ wage claims see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, stalked the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by high global agricultural export prices from Argentina.
But inflation eroded the boost to growth following a strong devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández shows signs that she wants to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the government entered into an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which resembles a prelude to INDEC's remediation.
It is unclear whether Ms. Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term, now that her husband is no longer by her side.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which Kirchnerism is highly advocated.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have refluxed.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to dismiss, quietly, many policies of her husband.
A half hour for China
Taiwanese voters are oriented towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the Strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of eligible persons, came to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for sentiments towards the continent, having established innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. My man passed the test, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five town halls, he failed to win the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (DPP), which has leaned towards Taiwan’s full independence, has won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If this had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s voting share has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT in municipal councils.
The event unveiled most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including busy country trucks and mass gathering flags with girls dancing in minimal outfit.
A compulsory mysterious assassination attempt has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of KMT, made an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd fired at the young Mr. Link, purely through his face, injuring him and killing a passerby.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to harm Mr. Link or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
Anyway, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the murder had consequences on the election by directing suspicion on the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking to see how the question of the continent itself was absent.
Instead, the applicants played with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid paradising its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stirring anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are indispensable for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trading facilities, in line with its strategy to deceive Taiwan, back to the cottage.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to hold a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, it would also like to see political integration; but let’s start with the beginning.
Better wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was going wrong: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to jail on accusations of corruption.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a provocator for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP is doing everything possible to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their interviews can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party presents a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hastily approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement from his cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to fight the presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will have difficulty choosing between its potential candidates.
The KMT has to make an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite a vertiginous economic growth, the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the wider gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said his office and local antennas will be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for the approximation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editor, “the point of no return has already passed.”
Grammy Award nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the category "best new artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to get to know about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at her Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, marked one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a large-scale nomination in the category of "Best New Artist".
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; which "establishes the public identity of that artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skillful pop and funk hand and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted jazz category at Spalding compared to Norah Jones's fulfilling success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy-winning voters in these years.
Elsewhere, Grammy Awards voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "Instrumental Album" category, a turn on a reviving thrill of a recording that was one of the main favorites last year.
Among these Iyers, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite of New Orleans's rauque voice and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also strongly leans towards a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke's, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
Secret Society of Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, has earned some well-deserved recognitions in the big ensemble category; competing with Billy Childs Ensemble's rich chamber-jazz and eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" from his live octet was a beautiful example of this bassist's democratic hand as a group leader.
Grammy Award nomination: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards feature a mixture of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
The nominations include Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman’s Madolin Concerto is also in competition for an award.
The classic nominations are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choir and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year featured five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium" by the Orchestra.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by BBC of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of the Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'amour de loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchester
Composers in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was first held at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a recorded performance by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his solo instrumental performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said he wrote the 15-minute work especially for the mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
“I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of ranges and rhythms from North Africa,” Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez was nominated in the category of orchestral performances for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received a nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominees for solo vocalists; these are Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonova, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots: My Life, My Song"
The project of the Temecula mosque wins the approval of the planning committee.
A mosque project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of public, often passionate testimony.
The critics attacked the project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic jams.
But the commissioners ruled Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
“Many good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it,” Hadi Nael, president of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center, said.
“I’m proud of it, as an American citizen.”
“It shows that justice wins.”
“The opposition is really minimal,” he added.
“They just have very loud voices.”
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight, with most of the time people pronouncing for or against the center, at roughly equally distributed speech time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
“There is no longer America,” one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including at Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence in Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of the order of 135 families coexists without incident in Riverside County for years but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot Mediterranean-style architecture mosque would consist of two minarets and rise to 43 feet tall.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
The opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"This is why it is very special, even though it is far from a truly 'foreign' form of life," said Paul Davies C.W. of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“We are wondering what is still possible,” said Ariel Anbar D. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in researching life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of alien life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms may be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, may not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Science Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
“This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure,” Cockell added.
It was not a random discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to substitute each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"Consequently, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it enters inside and somehow rubbers the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar said.
The researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing ever showed that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of Earth's existence, she says; thus, researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at first,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two exposure dogs on four robbers from outside a Bellflower motel were found, Los Angeles County sheriffs announced on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs — two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis — disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they spent the night outside a Bellflower motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found late Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore says.
"They're in good form."
"They have been returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs had been found, in which neighborhood, and what the circumstances of their discovery were.
"An investigation is ongoing."
“We don’t want to say it,” Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unable to join to provide a comment on Thursday.
They met Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputy found the van and the two dogs separately at Compton.
The Akitas - a 3-year-old male, Trace, and a 10-month-old female, Didi, were safe, the authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were missing until they were discovered Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of Long Beach’s “AKC/Eukanuba” national championship, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other events scheduled in the days preceding the "AKC/Eukanuba" exhibition, Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the couple's nearly a month-long canine exhibition tour.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked out at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Breton spaniel - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with the thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They have a little opened the windows, so the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck's flight at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with a microchip implanted to identify them.
It is unclear if a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to red again, MGM restructuring awaits only the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start again from scratch.
A federal New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially praised the "prepackaged" plan by creditors that about $5 billion in debt would be erased; paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and distributing movies and TV shows.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to rebound under the guardianship of Entertainment Spyglass founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the CEOs of what will be a lightened studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility planned to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the investment bank, which itself struck at $75 million, and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring process began in May 2009 when investment bank Moelis & Co. was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances as it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million a year.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a recovery expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the $2 billion more that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again as the MGM team had begun working on a restructuring plan that, after months of disagreements and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially goes out of bankruptcy in the following weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive multi-million-dollar premiums for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already earned $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which raised $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a “success premium” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to relaunch the production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films to come out in 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit" with Warner Bros.
The studio must make a separate loan between $265,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, has tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not reached an agreement.
Tech toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year’s most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft’s video game system, Kinect, both can make a significant breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 and a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic pearl jumping strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ Wholesale Club - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore’s Law has evolved, this year’s technology toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as well as rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are teddy toys the size of a pig from India that sing a note when you press them on their belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one makes it possible to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start pressing, you can no longer stop.
To combine singing with dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and over) is the best choice.
Inspired by last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative hinged feet with wheel locking.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of control over the volume.
If you’re an 80s kid, you’ll remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with game cards questionnaire designed to turn a car ride into a session with a self-correction and a valve workbook.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
VTech's Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games don't educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years old), it's the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with older cartridges.
The Fisher-Price iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card input that allows to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a light box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to train words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, which is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy shops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a Club Penguin pet online, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin marked with a hidden code.
When you buy back the code online, your child receives enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items to choose from.
These can be roller skates or a Puffle toy pet.
Slightly larger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and older) is the latest button battery micro-robot.
The fake beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage in the mouth of our dog.
To bring a milder side to the maintenance of order in China
Tang Shenbin walked a square in the city as an urban sergeant at training by strictly inspecting his nerve loads, issuing low-voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted chengguan female members - imposing law enforcement officials in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and inclination for violence - to convey some impression to a group of spectators.
"Stay straight!"
"Be piercing!"
He said, "Show them what pretty girls look like."
Four girls who had barely spent their teenage years in white gloves, dressed in identical jackets and pants in olive colour, were stuck to the guard.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned with the rule.
Four neat hats perfectly attached to the top of hair attached by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with contempt.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One town demanded that all new recruits have a graduate degree.
The Guangdong province has exchanged the grey-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, central China, replaced lower-eyes with the strong way:: In 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack trolley by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporter repacked his items and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in an urban setting of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, ability and young age.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have trouble drawing a look at this underground urban brigade from China.
And for the reason, critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media portrays the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei province inspectors beat an observer to death after he used his cell phone to film them scattering a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and online, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon colporter was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game impregnated with violence, available by downloading online, shows Chinese inspectors trained in the assault of street sellers.
"Chengguan has marked the government," China Daily, a national publication, said last year, after an ongoing controversy on tactics.
The newspaper called for "real complete cleaning."
Sceptics say the approach is far from it.
After the district announced in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if women had real tasks or were they just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district’s announcement required female candidates, aged 18 to 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and “the five face traits in the right order.”
They should be above average size, 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officers said the work was physically too painful for women over 25.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer to Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; it is about height, weight, face traits, etc."
Then come the temperament and the "inner qualities."
The women in Chengguan are like flowering vessels, he said, adding: "In addition to being vessels, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the requirement regarding the order of the face traits.
That it means beautiful is a topic of debate among the Chinese.
Certainly, people with disabilities or disabled persons should not apply.
"We can't let a boxing person or a bump come to serve here," Zheng said.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks pommeled with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the enhancement of her appearance as being sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a disappointed look.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old pit colleague, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They are not opposed to limiting their mandate, they said, because they nurture greater career ambitions than simply chasing sellers into alleys where they are supposed to limit their business.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen ambulant merchants who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many rolls or bowls of tofu as possible before running away.
"Master Wang, you have to go."
"We have already told you several times!" said Ms. Xu while a seller fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle bike.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than arduous.
“It’s roughly the same every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers' assets.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exposures of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, revolted after the spread of false rumors that Chengguan agents killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen Chengguan police and officers were injured, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or fired.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from Baoguang Square, where female officers patroled that morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner of the street.
Agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted at the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the police, with the sinister face, broke a path toward their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge turned back to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or older - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not formed to maintain a waxed image.
“Sometimes we fight verbally.”
"Sometimes we are physically fighting," Li said in a neutral tone.
“Most of the time, it’s the audience that starts.”
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have lifted criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to an assistant from a former campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying job for the wife's husband, Senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal around his case made the national headlines last year and damaging his career.
Mr. Ensign's office said he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Ministry of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to continue any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice refrained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a sort of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, saying there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign allegedly conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, emails and other documents, first released in the New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, get a lucrative lobbying job to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to do lobbying for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited by law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole for one year.
Ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, appears to be in contradiction with the so-called ban on the lobbying door.
"There appears to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantial violation of the turning door law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed to be distraying from political prosecution after a number of high-level setbacks received by its public integrity section, including the decisions made last year to abandon the Steven's former Senator's prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, Director General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that has received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's senior lawyer, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice on Monday and a follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyer team had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office reaffirmed Wednesday in a statement, "has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutor's office.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my talks with the Justice Ministry, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton was in violation of federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a leading Nevada company that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying jobs.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "hammering" the Interior Ministry on a disputed issue.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the transport secretary to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after engaging Mr. Hampton to do lobbying.
When news of the case came out last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned from his fourth-ranking Republican leadership position in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for several months, Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to hold a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the ethics committee would swiftly follow the Ministry of Justice's example and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing her hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
A half dozen of them were taping in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent reports of horrible testimonies every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape case trial and children attached to their bed in a house that was burned.
On Thursday, the broadly followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to lead to an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in the court that outlines appeals that may occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports on the trial – as well as the widespread and extensive use by Twitter journalists – have created a “circus atmosphere”, a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with incendiary details that the jury has been poorly influenced by the public’s passions.
The application could push appeals judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have experienced it during this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms infringes the human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Hayes, chief lawyer.
Trial judge Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State laconically rejected the claims in last week's judgment, claiming that the media was "healthyly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Appeal courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment, the U.S. Supreme Court cancelled the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers have stated that the appeals courts seized to review half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules could be needed to manage the means of communication in the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue says that some appeal judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from the courtrooms could allow for more fair trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many others described by Mr. Hayes’ lawyers, likely to be discussed for years; which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes was allegedly injured when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the jurors, who had been critical to prosecutors, and that he abusively put pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to deliberate on a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the trial's intense media coverage could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by U.S. Governor and Senate candidates.
They maintained that the computer media continued to stir the flames of the case's emotion.
“The daily swing of tweets from the media, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse,” the lawyers wrote, “would not resemble anything previously seen here, in New Haven, and perhaps even nationally.”
Their emphasis on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the claim that snapshots were more incendiary than slow releases was a luddist view that would impoverish the Court's policy governing media coverage of future trials.
But some lawyers said appeal courts were often attracted by arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes’ lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the 1966 Supreme Court ruling that overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and they specified that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring gaps closer?
After a campaign marked by invectiveness and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a warning sign of true bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no breakthrough on the major issues to be addressed during the “lame duck” session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion on the differences between the two sides as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
Wednesday’s public meeting on the president’s deficit was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but which, however, further divides the members.
This is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a period of mutual trial and testing for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
That's why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants unveiled a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether taxation, spending, health care or rights, both sides remain miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
“There is no doubt that things have changed in the tone,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now on the side of the Center for Ethical and Public Policy.
“It is inevitable after the election.
The elections arouse partisan passions, and then they fade.
That's good."
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment allowances, even because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax reductions for the wealthy, while denying unemployment allowances to unemployed workers.
Following Tuesday's White House meeting, more optimism is planning on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the "lame duck" session, with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "lame duck" session will not necessarily mean a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
“Once the things that need to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations,” he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
“I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this are closely linked to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters present in tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to meet their promises to cut public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the early reactions to the deficit committee's recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, raising retirement age and reducing spending.
Co-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, according to themselves, imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they struggled to reach that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, suggesting that there is little reason or willingness to compromise on tax matters, at least today.
Galston plans two phases in the fighting between the White House and Congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, as Republicans dispute Obama in budget, tax and health care; then followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proven that, despite the supportive spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the public’s reaction.
Those who will be judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would nevertheless be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are bigger today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans in Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort will be needed on both sides to find a ground of understanding on the issues that further divide them.
U.S. documents disclosed describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and brings to the Kremlin some of the bribes and protection money it collects, the U.S. embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
Police and the Federal Security Service are making huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the “vertical of power” – takes its part as money goes up the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The rating is based on sources whose names have been purged.
It was written while Yuri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there have been few traces of cleansing since then.
Lujkov and his wife, Elena Baturina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several defamation trials over these accusations.
In September, he said the following to a Russian television channel, when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt, according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information stated in an embassy report; and it is unheard of conceiving that it would be diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime has led some people to call it “dysfunctional” and claim that the government worked more like a kleptocracy than a government,” according to the embassy note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (term used in the criminal world/mafia which literally means 'roof' or protection) passing through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the Prosecutor's Office, as well as throughout the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-level structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are at the second level."
"At last, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services.”
The report indicates that the FSB is brewing the money of the largest companies and that the police are targeting the smallest.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow business owners understood that it was better to get protection from MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
“That’s why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high.”
The note notes that while the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly see their affairs closed under a pretext or otherwise.
Medvedev has repeatedly mentioned the fight against corruption but has admitted little progress.
The embassy note transmits reports of men bringing suitcases, probably full of money, to the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgi Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem think tank.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
“He is not part of a political class because he does not exist in Russia.”
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the index, the costs of corruption across Russia would be more than $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy note, which was made only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will with certainty stir the discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin assumed that WikiLeaks documents could be a fabrication and reacted angry to the remarks that U.S. diplomats had disclosed by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem lies in the fact that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be accomplished with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
Red Khmer veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly illuminated classroom with poor-quality decrepit concrete walls, the director of Anlong Veng high school spoke of the man who built it, the last leader of the Red Khmer, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said 42-year-old Sreng Kor Ma.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Red Khmer, this commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Red Khmer in northwestern Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former Khmer soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally challenged to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation enabled victims to face people who had participated in the regime publicly.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Red Khmer to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, delivered its first sentence on a former member of the Red Khmer, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former leader of the sadly famous Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the "Duch".
Faced with this development of the situation, anxiety increased among the veterans of the Red Khmer of Anlong Veng; complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Red Khmers but they are powerless to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent body that conducts research on the regime.
“For them, life under the Red Khmer was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“The situation creates divisions within families.”
Under the reign of the Red Khmer in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-United government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements went in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a sequel to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to defeat the government, culminating with the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had held his head, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 awaiting his trial.
Without their benefactors, most Red Khmer veterans have sunk into black poverty, common to rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic about the movement.
Although some Red Khmer elite officers have retained their positions as local leaders in exchange for depositing weapons, these are low-grade unskilled farmers.
“These people benefited from very little follow-up after the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which hosts public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
“They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime.”
"They were raised in a framework where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
“Life under the Red Khmer was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to live up to our own needs.”
The current Red Khmer court has also caused concerns here.
The court is expected to begin the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Red minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and principal perpetrators of the crimes, but it did not say whether it was pursuing beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to 64-year-old Im Chaem, former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the reign of the Red Khmer in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers were reportedly killed.
Recently, on a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from field work near his wooden house on pillows, on a ground path outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Red Khmers.
If the court convened her, she said, she would refuse to go.
“Cambodia is in peace and stable,” she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Khmers in 1978, also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the broken pieces," he says.
"We need to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The center produced the first government-approved manual on the Red Khmer, "A history of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's history manuals, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Red Khmer, despite the city's ties to the regime.
19-year-old Touch Valeak, a high school student at Anlong Veng, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came home with the book to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court,” he said.
“They are suspicious because they don’t know exactly how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Red Khmers retain a powerful attractiveness here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a path, invaded by weeds and dotted with plastic bags, leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a roof of rusty sheet metal.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a stack of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone seller on the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinered there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stock of military-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world.
The deal was released in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the margins of a security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of military-grade uranium from a Belarusian research center.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remainder of the matter of about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke of the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the Summit on Nuclear Security of 47 nations, organized on the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was beneficial to provide an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012.
“I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“It proves to me that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton called the agreement a “very significant, important step” by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Summit on Nuclear Security, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-grade uranium and lowly enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our product...We’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We’re going to use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus came closer to the United States a few months ago; however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, officials said.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus' research facilities with low-enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
“Cute coordination and organization have been implemented in order to build trust,” leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Department of Energy specialized in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Centre, Belarus this year had at least 88 pounds of military-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's hard-hitting of human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
Government has not objected to CIA flights
The government has not objected to CIA robbery of Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks in the newspaper El País, which add that the first Vice President of the Government at that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "demonstrate that they were exercising adequate vigilance on foreign planes crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report from the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries of complicity in human rights practices, including Spain, a meeting took place between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised the Zapatero Government out of play" and stressed that there was nothing to hide in Spain.
"De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no objections regarding intelligence thefts over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid "taking them unwilling," Aguirre says in a cable.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would like to give this case the lowest profile possible, even though, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence".
In turn, in January 2007, Attorney Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defense on CIA robbery.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy said after talking to the prosecutor.
The United States has shown concern about "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the declassified information from the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to maneuver the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the U.S. ambassador and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented to him that "even if the Spanish judges are crazy jealous of his independence and will do what they deem appropriate," he had given instructions to his employees "to avoid the comments of a rhetoric".
The ambassador also expressed concern about the action of the PP in this case.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. Government," she said.
The parricide that passed to confession complained in a network of the "accident" of being a mother
The girl talked about the boy when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as a child, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two originating from Noia, the village of the Coruña from which she originated.
The messages are from 2008.
To hear them, you need to know your sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of the testimonies of its parents.
The 30-year-old Galician girl started a relationship in 1998 with industrialist Iván Túñez.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they split up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elect was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week in Palma.
But according to the content of his communications, it is heard that their idyll has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Minorca alone and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and annoyed that I came to work there."
“When I told him, it seemed good to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
And then, she talks about a mobile message she had just received: "I want you to come home this month or you give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, "If she doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take him when I come home," she says.
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm leaving, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to run to a workstation so that I don't lose it."
She explained that if everything was fine, she would have taken her elder with her.
“He will stay with the right person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person unless that person is not my mother,” he said, considering their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she hit him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly murdered on the 10th, died.
“Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other.”
“On one side he’s with me and this place he likes a bit, but on another he goes to school almost every day.”
She talks about a trip to Mallorca.
"He'll go there a few hours in the summer and so I'm saving a little money from the babysitter."
The 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos in the email, you see, whenever he wants, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, el goes in summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there's one: "He's taking me forward with money."
On the Internet she has posts in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the Prison Liberator."
"Terror to the Galician (epigraph)."
The last man who lived with her, watching, declares her regret to feel guilty.
He doesn’t want to think that everything happened so she didn’t tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered the provincial prison in Palma yesterday, from the Minorca judicial detainee center.
Self-counsel Carlos Maceda explained that she does not remember how the incidents happened, "and she did not intend to harm the minor."
Before she had confessed to drowning Caesar in the bath and lay her body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
People’s Party members would win 4 seats in Congress and PSC would lose 9 seats
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and MPs recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes that this formation gets in these committees normally doubles that it gets in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes from the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomous, they had obtained 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired by the PSC's diversion of votes and the loyalty of the PP's electorate, the analysts of this formation calculated that if there were general elections, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it has 10) and PSC would not lose more than 9 MPs.
These calculations would find that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - it has three now - while ICV would keep one MP or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for the municipal comices, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populars agree that PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would also not get the majority of the opportunity to resort to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fantasy if this formation lost its representation in the town hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% of the votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they may be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes from PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign, they met several times.
Populars also recorded progress in other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Aside from the seven prisoners in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three inmates.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by agents of the Barcelona Police Information Station formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Earth" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Bomba" (Let) in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" Al Qaeda's international counterfeiting apparatus has been "weak" and "consequently its operational capacity".
Investigators calculate that the cell, within the two years it was active in Catalonia, could either send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrated the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that its "combatants" could cross the European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network held operational in Europe, which is why in the investigations, apart from the Thai services, other European police units participated, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days similar coups to that recorded last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis were detained Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddic Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand, another was held, with the capture of the Ehsanites and Atjhar.
They were the ones who directed the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole from tourists passports that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents were to be on behalf of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without a stamped visa.
The investigators point out that so far no details have been found that link the detainees in Catalonia with the bombing in Mumbai, even though the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be remembered that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia it was sent through a transfer agency a few thousand dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards that were used afterwards by the components of the "commando" which killed 106 people.
Police have seized abundant documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
PPC leader Alicia Sánchez-Camacho yesterday had the opportunity to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions to support his position as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and which are limited to giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-souveraine adventures that his economic leadership is compliant.
The president of the popular Catalans came to the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 MPs in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to make himself beloved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the nomination.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of the political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as for the president of the PP, to support an investiture "all sovereignist and independentist discourses should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the converging leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have jointly wagered to reduce the political apparatus of a highly exaggerated autonomous administration and the elimination of taxes on inheritance and donations.
Details of the negotiation on the inauguration of Mas will take care of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
Geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
Olot centre owners do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the harm caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people whom he was responsible for while he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be that of being able to carry out the charge against the responsible" for the dead but "the legality and responsibility force us to assume the process situation of civil officials".
And aside from the social discreditation that the entity may suffer for not detecting the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a significant compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that from that day on he has not ceased to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - he suspected that in many cases no doctor was personally exploring the deceased, but given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in this case there is only an indication of recklessness on the part of anyone other than the accused.”
The person already named "The Angel of Death" confessed 11 murders before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused her death by injecting an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat mentioned that it is difficult to control the access of the center's staff to medicine.
Insulin injections and sedatives cocktail had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila is not lying by saying that he sought for his first victims a less cruel death or, on the contrary, he burned them inside by giving them laundry as he already confessed he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the Night Nurse's statements, nor the number of confessed murders, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way of killing after successfully committing eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB Threat
Investors suddenly reacted yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The differentials in the peripherals have closed to force and the shares of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ECB's ability to make a mistake and the euro has barely recorded an increment, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by short and highly speculative position fences.
The institutional investor will be delayed to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank demanded the finalization of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary future-term liquidity measures and leaving only unlimited access to the week.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope that current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly unlimited access auction at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not fulfill the expectations generated, they will overthrow the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us!
Just as during their May meeting in which they claimed that they did not even consider buying bonds and collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse in the market.
Yesterday's one-year trade auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the guys in Portugal dropped 30 base points throughout the curve, and clearly reflected a change in market sentiment after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures for the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a focal point of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to release tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the president had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors' ears like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Exchange suffered 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical, and we enjoyed the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that this will be resolved with a strong demand and helps to dispel doubts about our ability to refinancing.
For Spain to ask for an Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to sine die markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, appearing."
Courage, we can get out of it!
President of Eulen will challenge Vega Sicilia's council requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers it "no law", the judicial council of El Enebro on the next 16th, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and take over the management bodies of the firm holding Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the larger holding of business services for companies does not appear to be willing to cede in his litigation to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded from his board by five of his seven sons who appointed themselves directors in the shareholder assembly on January 18th of this year whose contestation is registered in the Registry of Commerce and Societies.
The El Enebro judicial council for the next 16th, convened by the Madrid Commercial Magistrate No. 2, has reopened the thunderbox within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the dispute is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The latest movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resort of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, clearly fraudulent the Act and abusing the right, to validate and correct the assembly radically null on January 18", according to his reports.
This argument will be the basis for disputing, once the assembly takes place, that it is "null of full right".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a property company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group nevertheless seeks usufruit on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive matter that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request for contestation for which there is not yet a date indicated.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates real-time car improvements.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select world of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final phase of the championship they all bet on Fernando Alonso's Ferrari triumph.
Without diminishing the skills of the champion, German pilot Sebastien Vette, nor the capacity of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives far from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly chains from factories manufacturers from all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thereby avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements detected during racing and testing.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high-quality professionals are working, equipped with powerful computer equipment, to analyze and project all kinds of changes to the boosters.
The CEO of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of the Red Bull boosters except the engine, which is Renault’s exclusive responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can shift from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to create and produce its boilers in a town 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered “top secret.”
The staff for this duty has 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull's Formula One is probably the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy beverage brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero notoriety.
The factory’s chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, said five years ago it could be claimed that the progress of R&D in the case of racing cars brought 50% of the wins and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while drivers bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will set up 20 clean stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its associate Pont Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational company plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, has given an example of the redesigned store located on the Gran Vía of Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group prepared a plan to set up 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first opens were those in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM Personal Systems has assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with industry experience and knowledge.
The North American group advises and takes care of the design of exclusive shop furniture (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will keep an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of institutional staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in purchasing, support, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves possible issues with HP’s computer equipment as a warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
“This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets on ‘stealing’ a million customers to rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell’s CEO, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it envisages a collapse of interest margins, which will be attempted to partially compensate for with increases in commissions and credit price.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years, its task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
In 2011, the bank will launch a new master plan that will hold a three-year lability.
The goal, apart from surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market rating by the recruitment of a million new private customers - 700,000 if one deducts those who can leave the bank - its great task to accomplish, because so far this bank had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the individual customer.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market score for individuals is 3.5%, while for companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the fiscal year.
Few banks dare now set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disturbed all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize its Optima master plan this year, established four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for another year.
Customers who escape savings boxes will be their main goal.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years, it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking affair, he said.
And even though he thinks that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is falling down, the price of risk premiums that banks and cash registers pay for its issuances to obtain liquidity are already moving at the credit price to offset the falling margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't tightened the faucet, but the differentials are higher," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and raise differential prices - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also admitted that the banking sector’s trend now “is to raise commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger dimensions will be requested."
“Everything will move next year,” he said.
He claims that capital needs "increased tremendously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And it mentions that FROB can replace the market in fundraising in the case of new recapitalizations.
After assuring Sabadell can survive the timely closure of the markets, he diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it is not possible to issue, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which alleviates the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers between the funds
ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of saving fund mergers and again emphasized the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the Spanish Savings Funds concentration trial began, several entities assured that they would not participate in the first phase and reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers have been done, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most of them have been completed; it is possible that instead of 17 we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has worked a lot in this operation too," he said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process takes place "at the highest speed possible and we must be very satisfied with the way it takes place within the time limits set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain".
"The move from 45 cashiers with an average of 28,500 million asset volumes to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled trial in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to make them much bigger to be in accordance with Basel," he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unpleasant opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seroty and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year."
ECSC Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and he attributed people who doubt it to a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings funds, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes at the highest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has taken well from the stress tests that the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have resulted in a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or the abolition of the €426 unemployed without a professional contribution to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and the 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel regarding her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction on the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which shocks with that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable stream of opinion, nearly 50% of the population.
The third is a new conception of the euro, in line with German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for apology.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission boosted deficits, the German government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of a divergence between what Germany thought should be done (tax rigor plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second coup of the central European country was when Merkel hardly prolonged the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on she was subjected to fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Treaties of the Union to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the following months, we should attend the reform process of the Union that will make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not think it will cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date the old operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves to cease payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a part of the costs.
Germany informs us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be bad not to hear it.
It is not just about bringing the government deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we are asked for is much harder.
And what he should absolutely not do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give us greater tranquility.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity that we were given, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard this in this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after Saturday's meeting with big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, we have paved the way to the thesis that we need to put order at home.
But the red line that Germany traced is there, and they don’t seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that are being considered, we cannot exclude that of abandoning a monetary zone too full of unserious countries.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and Fraud of the Law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the willingness to escape a sanction.
The expulsion by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the November 23 game against Ajax in the Champions League has dropped a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the game ended (which their team was already winning clearly), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since Real Madrid will eventually become the leader of its group, the two players will carry out the regulatory sanction during the next game of the dam game against Auxerre and will be able to move without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee sanctioned team coach José Mourinho with two matches and different economic sums to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or the like is not a new practice, if not rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of ethos, the unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate arising in the case related is due to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his hymn displays nobility and honor and who in previous occasions has sentenced a fine to his players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, he seems, by his Mourinho, which adds a more episode of ditech.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is not expressly prohibited by the regulations contradict the principles of sport, that is, if with these actions one commits a fraud of law; because, indeed, they are actions that respect the sports regulations, but seem to elude its meaning.
The question is to consider the type of harm they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the goods that includes sports spirit is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been endangered, i.e. there has been no violent play.
Another of these goods to be referred to with the right game is to prevent the team of infringing players from unfairly enjoying the opposite team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it is not comfortable with what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the penalty of the referee.
They were waiting and they gladly accepted the sanction.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders obtain from the intentional mistakes examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that one does not put the rival in a disadvantage situation and one does not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action assumes the fact of leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it’s not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn’t count on these players.
Obviously the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indetermination, as the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players carry out a penalty match and move to the second round of cards, in which suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, climbing the steps is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the sports spirit, which is still part of making strategic decisions that promote the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players have not acted to avoid the application of the penalty (this would indeed be a clear case of law fraud), otherwise they have instead chosen the time at which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without overcoming the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the boundary between genius and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy appears to me due to two factors: because there have been two self-expulsions and because of the way the director transmits them to provoke them.
The harm caused by these actions to the principles of sport is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Offensive offer to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The calendar dictatorship this year concentrates an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tournament and the lottery, when December arrives also the group dinners before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for the restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have led to an offensive you prices adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, co-concient the sector men.
To finish complicating the accounting, this year’s calendar (as the night of St. Sylvester falls on Friday) concentrated demands in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the source of the difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying with their own pockets.
Anything is the conjuncture, they all ask for battle prizes, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
“People think a lot before booking.”
“They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to prices,” he said.
The affair will go well "for those who give quality at a good price and with good service," he adds, recalling that customers tend to descend a level with the crisis, so the slice around 25 euros has become a majority in demand.
A survey of various institutions in the centre found the collapse of applications for the night of 17th.
The Soteras group indicates that there is an authentic boom of applications for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the conjuncture, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar assumed more early bookings, even from the beginning of November.
"We did the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a boom in billing since the second half and good, albeit concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the parties in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the Champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite their employees again and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased a little.
On the part of the Fecasarm patronage (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall reservations are "animate", even if customers "negotiate to the maximum".
This is true, hope for the festivities has not decreased, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country.
Wikileaks leaks confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy of Pakistan and the U.S. State Department filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program is causing in Washington.
Aside from the enlightening and tasty details offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal the fact that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the Asian unstable country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make it difficult to destroy in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
The ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the Taliban-attacked territory, the dispersion of nuclear materials with short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain guard.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decrease in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said during a meeting with U.S. counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani degree of nuclear weapons production.
A May Embassy dispatch, which calls the communication with Pakistan “frustrating,” supports the following: “Transparency is frequently non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a South Asian National Intelligence official, noted that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Army of Pakistan must end tacit support to terrorist groups."
Hunting for the WikiLeaks Leader
Obama will name a senior anti-terrorist officer to avoid further infiltration.
Interpol issues a red alert to track movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Interpol issued a "red alert" yesterday to "locate and track Assange's movements".
Nevertheless, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this is not new, otherwise it is dated November 20.
And this has nothing to do with the latest leakage of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks founding lawyer Mark Stephens said that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
The international police force headquartered in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Interpol's 188 countries have been instructed to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Even though Interpol cannot give an order to arrest an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the red note appeal a free way for arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as is the case with Sweden and England.
The movement outraged Assange’s lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer questions by videoconferencing to Swedish authorities.
They also recalled that Assange requested and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's chief of security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the statement said.
As the world seeks him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to find himself in an unknown place, but he doesn't quiet.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview with the director of Time magazine via Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to U.S. graduates that they spie at the UN by violating the international treaties that the U.S. has signed, she should resign,” he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as " ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should be of interest to us,” he told CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a senior anti-terrorism official, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama’s spokesman to reduce Assange’s importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the Congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower House from January onwards, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance."
Even further went Tom Flanagan, a adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to return to his statements after saying Assange would have to be "murdered."
“Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something like that.”
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and potential presidential candidate.
“Whoever is in the government that has filtered the information is guilty of betrayal and whatever is not an execution would be a too kind punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with blinks of eyes to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the ongoing internal revolt within ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that this can absolutely not give him headaches as he had with other extinguished currents.
That's why Esquerra's leader will try to win his new critics with blinks of eyes that allow him to blind up to the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC counsellors will be able to secretly decide on its continuity.
By voting ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of penalization to the president, they will be able to do so without any fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, not mentioning the percentages, that a result "to the Bulgarian" would not be good either.
People close to Carod demand a little more from the president than making his position available to the militant, a gesture that is not the case when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ between congresses.
But because they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to approve a roadmap with the executive until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18th.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The ERC leader admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that his goal is to make the organization once and for all able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet has signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered as Puigcercós' ideologist, the holder of Innovation thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five, of which he highlights two.
The first, to "recompose" the executive to account for at least 90% of the militants, i.e. to include new figures that come from Carod's adept sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC once and for all the assembly as an operating mechanism.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsion commissioned the management to revise the assembly model in a specific congress of statute reform.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this topic.
Now, without critical sectors on the lookout, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month, according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Between the murders are mentioned three women and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
During the pre-last month of the year, 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime were recorded.
Among the cases we mention that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shotguns and the shot of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the luggage carrier of an abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas Street in Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, Naucalpan Municipality.
Early Thursday morning, the owners of commonly exploited land found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the chest, on the highway near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight shots as he left his house to initiate the garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a shot at the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace in the forehead, a man's body was found on a solitary path to Colonia El Naranjo, and under the body, a 25-caliber firearm bullet was found.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water canal of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
Residents of Tepotzotlán alerted about the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada, with hands tied behind and eyes tied.
The man had a wound produced by a gun shot in his neck.
In the middle of the month the execution of two men who had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán of Zaragoza was reported, two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the following morning the corpse of a man in Huixquilucan, who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, was identified in principle with the name Mario Ríos, in agreement with a message that his executors had left to him.
In Ixtapaluca, with firearms in the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the San Francisco Acuautla hamlet.
On the woman's skin, Santa Muerte tattoos and necklaces with her image were detected.
At the end of the month, a man's dead body was found at the edge of a car in the Zinantecentepec municipality with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with a head and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and hands and feet tied, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón settlement and was wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a cinnamon ribbon and a message next door; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The country's representative at COP16 said his country has made huge efforts to reduce the trace of coal and said he maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% by 2020.
China maintains its offer to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45% by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and convert its industry.
In fact, his country has invested $245 million in the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and pilot programme support.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including last year's approval of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets addressed with regard to greenhouse gas reduction, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and locals to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy-efficient use and emission reduction.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans ongoing or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Efficient Energy Use Program, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial project for climate change, another for changing incandescent lamps with efficient lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the country’s government on climate change, assured that China’s efforts have been greater than is thought.
For example, the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historic contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make another similar one by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of PAN detailed that the former panist leader has the right to appeal to the National Order Commission to demand what is lawful.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to call on the National Order Commission to demand what is lawful.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, if necessary, a complaint to the National Council Order Commission, so that this is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential nomination.
Nava Vázquez expressed conviction that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections of December 4 and 5, where a successor should be elected.
“This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for now, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and achieved its goal,” he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why “internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, “we enjoy it and make us stronger,” he said.
He said that the council will probably be able to elect the best leader Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would give the ranking "to the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party's presidential office to any of the five."
He predicted that the party’s recovery in the July 4 elections will be reflected on the next dispute, even if “it’s not yet the time to think about 2012.”
"For now it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he emphasized that the three governments emerging from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and a reason for observation throughout the country, so there have been "many hopes for them, and I am sure Gabino will meet expectations."
When asked about PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calderón’s speech during his four-year rule, César Nava asked priists to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; let them start defending them; let them get out of the cabinet," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no gag, let alone censorship in the country.
Obama promotes law on twitter for unpapered students
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve of this legislation,” the president tweeted on Twitter.
President Barack Obama gathered today at the national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legalize unpapered students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
“If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve of this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His short message keeps a cyber link open with a broader document that calls on the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of tax cuts from Bush’s time and government funding continue.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other drafts such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he is confident that once the tax problem is resolved, we can set an agenda for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be solved before the end of the year."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point in that direction and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a “closing vote of the debate” for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize unpapered students could be voted from Thursday next in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they stayed in that country for the last five years, and they were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But supporters require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they require the help of a large number of Republicans, at times when the organizations supporting the project protagonists intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar de Indiana.
This is why supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of his Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they said they were not going to back it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put a finger on the wound
The second stage of the Pleasures of the Language was a walk in which the participants showed the narrative
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what do we hope of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair, the round table was-
The finger on the wound "...sets us in embarrassment," the Argentine writer gently launched to the public, most of the young people, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined as a great story afterwards, with Luisa in first person as a protagonist who seeks to know what the "plague" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "patience is not my strength, it is perhaps my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath off in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded: "On the wound I only knew that it is actually open and that it doesn't exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be closely linked to each other.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative that he entitled Praise to the Invention, where the finger on the wound is not named but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he talks about a famous enchanter who touched clouds, turned people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a narrative that turns to talk about America, the great news that had had her own columnists from the beginning and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of narratives.
“Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) mocked the false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a fifth way we would never have told the history of America with an imagination that lacked even humility.”
Nevertheless, he stressed, “the fools and the liars have the best imagination” and here reality converges with the lie, it is no longer known which part of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
This is called the 'Cervantes' tradition.
“Thanks to his legacy, we are what we tell.”
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table Le doit on the wound.
The Cuban-Portuguese has put hers on the great wound of social violence that her country is experiencing - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about drug trafficking and sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," she said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the engagement between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "that must be on the wound of the engaged writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at great speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciousness that turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times putting a finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance, and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had highs and lows in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, which find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the finals, he has had highs and lows in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, although so far he hasn’t put in the mile and that’s why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine finally comforted himself with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist arrived in his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reigns of Morelia with which he lost with a overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closure he also arrived at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall score of 3-1 against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered again a setback, because his team made an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalties series he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed the result of 4 of 11 meters and he submitted the result of 3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to detach himself from the evil to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even though he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," he said when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the last final, from which he assures that he has learned a lot, "The only lesson we can take is that until the referee whistles the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run the end before I believe this is the one.
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We never seek to get to the final series of penalties, we try to finish this situation in the regular time, but sometimes we only have left to prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the destiny has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or the anxies of holding the title.
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to Visa Applicants Service Centers before interviewing in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting time will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa processing procedure at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to apply to the Visa Applicants Service Centers (ASC) before interviewing in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take biometric information from the applicant, which will be revised by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will provide certain benefits for applicants, including the following:
The total cost to process the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to obtain an appointment, another payment for the processing of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The applicant will make a single payment covering all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including visa for temporary workers) and $390 for visa for merchants and investors.
Those wishing to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present the documents and take their fingerprints.
Due to the fact that biometric information will be taken in the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the $26 extra service fee.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency cited the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aerospace and Space Administration (NASA) will communicate an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured it would present who will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which has sparked speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, living in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses arsenic as a way of living and this ability makes us think that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the real scope of the discoveries at tomorrow’s press conference Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn’s largest satellite), with the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Germ PRD, PT, Convergence and opposing 'block' pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is made possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in Congress appeared an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four were questioning one thing: the arrival of 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'tone' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, we initiate 'bipartism' because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that on the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme starting from a political will and if they do not, they will again be enslaved by the two parties and thus end the opposition coalition.
“So far as this has happened (the opposing coalition), that’s what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patron there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolist, should now be "duopolist".
“It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartisanism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more, the Convergence abunded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that Congress has now turned into a 'booty' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
“Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the member’s personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Let them not leave out by five-cupular agreements that will probably be nine MPs, now at the five we are seen, separated in different fractions, we have decided to come together to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform they made, that they decided, we are out and we do not agree with this reform."
$200 million more for "Supplier"
The City Hall of Mazatlan pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 miles of pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Hall.
With this, the amount paid this second half to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles pesos.
According to the Transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in the concept of "liquidation of account suppliers".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Commune would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, consequently, how many cheques will be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We haven't bought anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter on November 16.
Even though the supplier has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, as predicted by the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25, Northwest had published a review of the cheques that the City Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that between March 2008 and July 2010, in the triennate of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques worth more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the poor conditions of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist in a pit of the Sánchez Taboada roundabout, the tourism sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor conditions and project a poor image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, recalled that they have repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be cared for and new activities should replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said the poor state of the streets and sidewalks has affected as tourists come to walk there and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to shut down a business one day and they don’t know the fortune we lose, elsewhere they didn’t do the work for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to take on its responsibility and avoid this happening again, how to do it, so through a preventive interview and not just doing the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area we must maintain it, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the City Council must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it does not depend only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They weren't given the right attention and these kinds of facts emphasize something that is notorious to everyone, interview is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that need to get together with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourism vocation.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers many historic and cultural sites and places that we should order first, clean and put on line to make them attractive so we can add them to the inventory we have to promote this destination."
IP Requests Results to Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
The business sector of Mazatlan is seeking a Legislature of dignified work and free of agreements between the parties and the government executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday was set up the 60th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new members of the Government Congress are clean and committed management with society and different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that MEPs take the great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations it faces.
"We hope MPs really exercise their right, free of agreements between parties because the custom is that they make pacts to protect their own interests and they turn into a carnival mascara of rulers and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified and mostly committed work with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the state, because now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, that they generate stimuli for investment and infrastructure and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he requested that the new legislators give it the importance that it has in the government budget to consolidate the Governmental Tourism Secretariat.
"I have understood that it is the second smaller budget State Secretariat and is inconsistent as a major economic activity and a currency-generating and investment-generating activity that directly competes with the agro-industry."
Apart from the fact that resources need to be classified to detonating tourism projects that help provide state assurance and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
Looking for King Mage
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Wise Kings will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, as their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble home in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a monster truck and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothing for a year.
"He said to me (Jose Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster,' but I said to him, 'We'll see, my son,' because he was very dear," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who was in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11, is wearing size 12; Isaías, 10, is wearing size 10, while Miguel, 8, is wearing size eight.
José Juan, 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Seeking King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money at the reception of Northwest.
14 alleged drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were conducted in Estrie on Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were allegedly used for drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for Quebec Security.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of this network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were expected to appear at the courthouse in Sherbrooke within hours of their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy, and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place as a result of a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was from the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests," Ruel said.
Some 70 police officers from the Quebec Regional Investigation Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Agency took part in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can continue without problems
The Conservative bill, which the government says should solve the problem of boats loaded with illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff said, while surrounded by MPs after holding the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants to be held for up to one year, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because he was targeting the wrong target.
“We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we’ll see what the government will do,” Duceppe said.
The NPD’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected from the back of the hand criticism that her party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants.
“The neo-Democrats agree that we should take action against illegal smugglers and that’s what we are doing through another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservatives bill because it attacks refugees and imprisons children for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“Canadians massively tell MPs they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a strawberry.”
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Minister Kenney.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections after its rejection.
A Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every member who opposes would then explain himself before his voters.
The new unit is not unanimous.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public investigation committee on the subject.
Public Security Minister Robert Dutil argues that this idea was not yesterday: Quebec reportedly consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet Tuesday’s announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Quebec Police Services on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It didn’t take any more for the Pekist critic of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement a “rabbit out of a hat” and a “solution brickled on the corner of a table.”
Minister Dutil, on the other hand, responded to those who fear that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unity.
“You’ll see the result when we announce it, he just says.”
“We are aware of this problem.”
For CSQ Chairman Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
“The more Mr. Charest is obstinate not to want to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to have an inquiry committee is to resign Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he suggests that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's cardboards.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the Hammer Prosecutor, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some amendments related to this file.
During Operation Spring 2001, which struck biker groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently enacted the Gangster Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high surveillance due to the heavy rainfall that has fallen in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another slide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
There's a road down.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, heavy rainfall fell across several regions, 40 to 70 millimeters of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday evening, depending on the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimeters of rain in total.
As this rainfall must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in certain sectors, there are fears of the overflow of several streams.
Flood warnings were issued Wednesday night by Quebec Civil Security for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jerôme, in the Laurentides, and the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has resulted in the overflow of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated by preventive measures.
In Outaouais, the overflow of some lakes led to the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Centre on Wednesday issued warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and Le Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont faced a partial setback in front of the Canadian Radio Standards Council (CCNR) for controversial words on social assistance and Haitians as well as on his rude language in waves.
The CCNR believes that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team were entitled to express their opinions, but that some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and coarse language that is not suitable for day-to-day broadcasts".
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, did not violate broadcasting codes.
The CCNR received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Common Front of Social Assisted Persons of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were inaccurate.
Animators should present solid information rather than misleading.
Regarding suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide a cowardly gesture.
The majority of members of the Committee concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont le midi' addressed a delicate topic in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame was held in his place.
The last dispute was about statements following the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then surrendered to a face-to-face media that had sparked many reactions.
The CHOI host said he didn’t donate to help Haitians because it couldn’t be known with certainty that needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduely negative representation of Haitians.
“I’ve already purged my three-day suspension on this.”
“My file has been blank for a year and a half,” the host said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of rude language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM has collaborated "beyond its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which, among other things, will have to announce these decisions once during the hours of high listening within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Naceredine Zemmal has an extremely special journey.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai boxing climbs on the tatami and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals.
“In my case, I’m looking for fights everywhere, because for those who don’t like ground games in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America.”
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and as a commissioner for the UPS company just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"Right now, I'm preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"Fighters who finished among the top four in the last world championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, while I got third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“What’s interesting is that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
"At that rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where punches and foot, as well as floor projections, are allowed.
The duels originally take place on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most renowned pugilist from this form of combat is the Vietnamese-born American Cung Le, well-renowned in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to remember only one event in his career, he will surely respond to his presence in the super-King of Sanda tournament, the kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," the friendly gay said.
"It's a bit the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real pro," he said.
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).
"The winners of the semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without calls for tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in OTC contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor that has obtained the largest, that of the project management, for a sum of $295 million without call for tenders.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risks eliminating competition and causing prices to rise.
“That’s the new way to make collusion and lower competition.”
“It means that people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly,” MEP Sylvain Simard told a news conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue to the National Assembly because he said it was hard to see how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there was collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my journey," she whispered, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigor."
She said "that would be the least thing" that the PQ apologizes.
The consortium formula is a common practice worldwide.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to combine their respective expertise in order to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the extent of the work.
The construction site is underway and is scheduled to continue until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition acting; there was negotiation.
Therefore, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium formula in the engineering consulting sector is being investigated by the government.
A rapid overflow of the Quebec business register allows more than 200 consortia to be counted, some of which seem to be permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, brings back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay responds to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has responded in a particular way since the 1970s".
The large Eastmain project manager, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Energy Society (James Bay Energy Society, JESB), gave an explanation that flashed on the fact that the project management contract was awarded volunteerly.
"If you go to tenders and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
“You have two choices: either you take the people in that market and you say, ‘We’re going to negotiate a satisfactory deal with a good price.’”
“But the idea is that it’s not the price that matters, it’s people’s competence,” Laporte said.
This contract to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consulting contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not counting its participation in Energy Gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the managed Energy contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau dropped that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance" it, before clarifying that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The "green" label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer trusts very little in the stakeholders in sustainable development, but also in fair brands and green certifications to guide their choices.
Even though he bathes in a media world where the messages for more responsible consumption pullulate, he regrets a lack of credible information, which he even calls a brake to his commitment, says the Responsible Consumer Barometer, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, however, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumer at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications applied to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands showing themselves to be eco-responsible, the Barometer says.
In the same vein, politicians’ speech on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
Responsible consumption information, however, seems to be vital to stimulate this part of consumption currently lived by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubiousness of information would calm the burning of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
On the other hand, a third of Quebecers are also suspicious of the alleged performance of green products or services that are being sought to put into their hands.
On another note, consumers were nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habits and mostly changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At the level of 61%, they also promoted purchases from traders in their neighborhood and privileged the purchase of food products grown in their region, the Barometer indicates.
More green and responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about animal protection.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside of his car, the Barometer says: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport or advocated carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A State Loan for the Purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was asked to engage financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus et le Parallèle, agreed to collaborate, but with a loan only.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the film complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving it its full cinematic vocation, did not get what they demanded.
The government agrees to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would be less than initially expected, which could be a viable solution at advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources from the state offices.
A first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris dossier.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet’s counter-proposal arrived at SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle and Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the State's donation really needs to be ruled out.
Remember that the Association of Cinema and Cineparc Owners of Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to fund real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas.
But several stakeholders in the environment, on the contrary, demanded substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of skies, for ten years carried the author's cinema to an end in his premises of the complex after financing its construction himself, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to retain its customers.
The Angus Society and Parallel, with Christian Yaccarini at their head, are conducting a private funding campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push into the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one of the three screens, The Parallel, continues to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th by projecting the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall The Duty and it is unknown what he and his group think of the downward proposals that are made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the U.S. views as the Canadians’ inferiority complex toward Americans, but at the same time they betray the latter’s feeling of superiority toward Canada.
Thus, U.S. diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter doesn’t have Canadian-American relations in mind by going to vote and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the Conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under the tooth.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of a federal election campaign, describes the extent to which the United States is not one of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great amazement of the U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gives some explanations to this situation.
"A nearly inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday internal issues rather than bringing this election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)," he wrote.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands all the less this "dull silence" as the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
“Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more party leaders to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote.”
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, a business officer in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s survival in the early February trust vote on the federal budget, where Canada will display its first deficit in more than a decade because of a $30-40 billion recovery plan,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is mentioned that the government had to extend parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties were making its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast on CBC are referring to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O broadcasts, in which unsubtle references are observed to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's kidnappings for muscular interrogations.
Another cable reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of the "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
“The secretary agreed to review the file.”
Finally, let’s note that the minds are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former counselor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC waves that the responsible for this mass leak should be "murdered."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancún proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction to be achieved to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan follows the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that still monopolise 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by compact fluo bulbs or, better, by light-emitting diode bulbs (DEL or "LED" in English), the majority of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet would be emitted for lighting.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major issuer countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will take another 5 Gt from this balance sheet to be able to stabilize the climate rise to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to avoid it falling out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced twice as much.
Compact fluorescent bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, giving an idea of the possible savings with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand-new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
They do not contain mercury.
Several experts have made reserves for compact fluorine bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers put in place instructions.
But, the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluo bulb, but rather the coal-fired thermal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year on electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants that would cost it 2.5 billion dollars to build.
Côte d'Ivoire awaits in nervousness announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," a spokesman for the UN leader said.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission passed the deadline for Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday’s election.
About forty minutes before the deadline expired, the CIS president told television that the committee "continued to work" to announce the results.
Appeals on Wednesday increased worldwide for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former rebellion of the Forces nouvelles (FN) since the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Ivorian president's campaign director, said the intimidation of voters by the FN in the north of the country had deterred the outgoing president's supporters from going to vote.
The entire election could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo’s opponents believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who deny any ties with the former rebels, found the delay in the announcement of the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until claiming the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday was supposed to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that remained split in two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished at the top of the first round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against 32% at Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Bureau of Labour (BIT) remained stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% counting overseas departments), show the provisional seasonal variation (CVS) corrected data published by the Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed is 2,631 million in the metropolis.
The second quarter data were confirmed to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOMs.
Over a year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market has further deteriorated, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, rising to 24.2% in metropolis (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over a year) and 25% including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
Seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, to 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points over three months as well as one year), 482,000 people aged 50 or older, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only the 25-49 years of age benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 points over three months, +0.1 points over a year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee has not published monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of waste processing companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was prosecuted and knocked down at the Luynes jailhouse near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, confiscation, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
“It’s easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reproachable chefs, it’s another thing to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client’s hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, required, through his lawyers, to bring to the judge before his hearing a memo to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also prosecuted Wednesday night and crashed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but running the landfills he had to manage.
As to the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he has never been aware of it, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was prosecuted Wednesday for diversion of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with a prohibition of meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to provide explanations for the facts he is accused of."
"The instructor magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of freedom," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four others had been prosecuted and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them being placed under judicial scrutiny, Deputy Prosecutor Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager for the cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted for "trafficking in influence and passive corruption".
Two civil servants in the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged with one for "subtraction and misuse of public goods by one person charged with a public service mission", and the other for "complicity of misuse of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was finally charged for "recovery of abuse of social property".
Among the people who faced Mr. Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who recently broke into a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement in Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of having used to launder the money of great banditism.
The investigation was conducted as part of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous mail, for alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigations focus on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne and some cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", held the opinion in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the attentive eyes of U.S. diplomats.
The U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some underlying of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, including giving them advice on how to treat their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the US justice for trafficking in materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put under a crude light the way the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French commentary on how to manage hostage cases".
Elysée’s strategic affairs adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own forced-retained nationals to Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “hammer constantly” in the media the words “fundamental human rights”, “innocence”, “immediate liberation.”
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to do it.”
For, after attempts to discuss through discrete channels, “silence will not resolve anything,” the Iranians are “masters in delaying manoeuvres.”
Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is “a familiar Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she takes refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (€230,000 bail).
And he says that the Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison for twelve days, but is still blocked in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. demands the extradition for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris at the decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is chasing Iran’s underground networks for nuclear program equipment, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France accept a merchandise?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he said, was not only "completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There have been vivid exchanges between the French presidency and the seal guard" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision," he notes.
Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" surveillance of French intelligence services.
The counselor of the Elysée calls a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently located in buildings in Paris run by the Iranian embassy.”
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee does not spare its efforts, through press releases and "leaks" organized, to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that the manipulation bears its fruit since several newspaper articles repercut the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what is based so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris wonders.
“Despite their praising statements, French officials acknowledge in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysée to pour into this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unmerited".
In “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris seeks to “demonstrate to Syria what praises it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region.”
The aim is also to “sow seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything."
“But we thanked them anyway.”
“It should at least sow confusion among Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their “active role in the liberation of our compatriot.”
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a Cinderella bill that will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials said.
A bill will be submitted to parliament in December to ask online gambling companies to block access to these games after midnight for young people under the age of 16, said representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
“We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, a ministerial official in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it, the official said.
It will also make free software available to people who demand it to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints organizing countries
In full turmoil due to suspicion of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday appoints the hosting countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking the lead over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the FIFA Queen Competition will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its settlement in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities among the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measurement of the economic and political challenges of a World Cup.
The negotiations behind the scenes may therefore last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) records have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC delivered a diaper on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that pins three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to dissatisfy FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who have launched intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The government chief hopes to re-publish the successful blow by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the organizing of the 2012 Olympics for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity suffice to revive the blueprint of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack assets with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (World-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of both countries could shower their ambitions.
Possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are only increasing the score of Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite the gaps in its record (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the trip to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a barely covert allusion to the English press' accusations against EC members.
“We are covering them with mud, we are trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strong from the experience of 1994, appeared as the logical favourites.
The world's leading economic power, headquarters of FIFA's leading sponsors, appears to be ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the 2026 World Cup to China, which is highly desired by FIFA, which would indeed reduce Asian opportunities by 2022.
With Qatar, which released the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries are more at risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weak TV fees paid (due to the time difference) by European countries, the nerve of war for FIFA.
Second term: the evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
One order at the Elysée calls another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence doesn't clean up the part of mystery attached to the presidential office.
So we must pretend that doubt always exists.
In one way as in the other.
In 2006, even unbelieving, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011".
He mentioned before UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening in the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" has thus sown a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his nomination?
We were far from it.
The president only recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five years to two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election, in the tone of humor, in such meetings.
“At worst, or at best, you still have seven and a half years with me,” he said in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His words before yesterday do not make him more candidate than the previous one; they do not make him less candidate.
If they arouse comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the PS candidature race, on the one hand.
But it’s not Ségolène Royal’s entry that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because his nomination in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are calling for an earlier battle order than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's nomination to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
“We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP about this,” the Prime Minister’s entourage immediately and cautiously reacted.
“If he believes the possible defeat, he will not be a candidate,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, obviously resigned.
Euro: ECB forced to maintain its purchases of securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year was to be an opportunity to clarify the ways of exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the unconventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt requires, the Frankfurt issuing institute will probably not be able to afford to be so peremptory if it does not worsen a situation more than tense today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be all the higher.
On the occasion of a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde praised the ECB’s active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not want to say whether it felt that the central bank had to do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
“I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...).”
The day before, in Brussels, during his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not speak more about his intentions, merely indicating that the programme for purchasing state securities on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting this Thursday.
Only certainty: The ECB will keep its main governing rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s purchases of Treasury bonds doubled last week to nearly €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem have purchased for €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the anticipation of continued purchases (see page 29).
The economists also do not expect a significant change of course.
While loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still provides unlimited cash allocations under generous conditions for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this system to be extended for a few months.
“I can’t imagine that she’s significantly changing her program.”
“If not, it would risk creating new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“A gradual release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” says Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds in order to animate a weak market," added Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks’ exposures to the euro area’s sovereign debt markets, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way to prevent a packaging of returns paid by the most fragile states," a leading bond manager said yesterday.
For if interest rates fall, states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not to stabilize it.
The safeguarding of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government turns its back
After a worrying start of the week for Italy, the situation was slightly relaxed yesterday, with the reflux of 10-year bond rates.
A return to precarious calm.
Upon a meeting with the Economy Minister, the regional presidents said they had heard Giulio Tremonti call the situation "indecipherable" and expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he later denied.
On Tuesday, the difference with German long rates had reached the record of 210 base points and the price of bankruptcy risk coverage contracts (CDS) had flown to 263 points, causing some disruption in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the difference with German rates was above 400 base points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "strongly concerned" about "the turbulence of the markets" and a possible contagion coming from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it is like Portugal,” says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the atonia of tax revenues that goes along with it, putting the state at risk of no longer being able to cover its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italy's growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current budget in the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% expected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of €7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will need to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving the support of international institutions.
“The basics of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we have long repeated it,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem at the moment, neither in the short nor in the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts demanded from Italy are less than those demanded from other countries," said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the House of Representatives, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
It would then open up a period unfavorable for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde once again hammered it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe we have demonstrated it again Sunday in the day and in the night, are obviously solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although any relative, yesterday's delay on the rates of European bonds brought water to the mill by governments and the ECB.
But it is not yet possible to talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt rating, the target most targeted today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs especially on banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas said.
“Political time is much slower than market time.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it encloses, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis mechanisms.
The informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are going well.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of the unconventional measures to support the euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia on Tuesday in Singapore to inform far-eastern investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly preparing the ground for them.
The first EFSF securities issues are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative told Reuters that the U.S. would support a possible increase in funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The first-line countries, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both agree to avoid seeking international assistance before implementing their own budget corrections and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to restore lasting trust.
Finally, European donors are discussing the options available to speed up the process of normalizing the markets of sovereign bonds.
In Paris on November 24, Axel Weber had first put forward the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to put hands on the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an increase of about 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism with up to now €60 billion.
A council that has all the chances of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions deteriorate.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
The snow events still create traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna, have joined the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, sustained snowfall affects the north of the Gironde and Charentes and it snows weakly on Ile-de-France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snow events are noticeable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departmentals were banned from heavy cars weighing more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the gendarmes who recommend taking its vehicle only in case of need and the traffic of some TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday night to restrict the traffic of heavy trucks.
The prefecture "invites all drivers to take the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris's Roissy airport and 10% in Orly on Thursday due to upcoming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been on its way, the billions are raining.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the Grand Paris metro that the Société du Grand Paris is to build.
To start this SGP, the state has announced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this amount that will then allow the SGP to borrow a share of the financing of its double loop on the markets.
Now we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Amendment Finance Act, which was reviewed by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the planned arrangements for finding the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, according to the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris".
It is figured out: "The income of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a reorganization of an office tax that already exists "in order to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that yield?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from $4 billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources add to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation that will be mobilized by the state and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the statement read.
In the SGP, we do not find this system shocking.
"From the moment you create revenue (both taxes), you can cover the three-year studies and then type in the 4 billion afterwards," it is explained.
“It will be included in the budget and pulled out as it goes.”
The SGP estimates that the 4 billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the $4 billion promised are still for absent subscribers, risks provoking a slightly agitated parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avengers and spy hackers in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it turns out to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that appears as a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs the relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and prefigures a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that every file constituted by a secret service (from any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The “extraordinary” American revelations about Berlusconi’s sexual habits are only reporting what could be read for months in any newspaper (except those Berlusconi owns), and Gaddafi’s sinisterly caricatural profile has long been sketch-matter for cabaret artists.
The rule that secret records should be composed of only known news is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous works.
And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do unprecedented research (nor knows where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only in what they already know, and who reconfirms what they had already learned.
That's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
I'm going to the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) the head of the secret services (if not he could be, I know, editor at Liberation), who holds as true only what he acknowledges.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since heads of states can phone or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises of representation, have become spy centers.
Any spectator of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy under bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims in crisis as much as the "wurflings".
But let’s come to the deep nature of what happened.
Once upon a time of Orwell, all power could be conceived as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had proved completely since, being able to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway taken and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – elected as the avenger of the citizen – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret, because it falls within the public domain; but revealing, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton’s secrets were empty secrets to her.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but has made it too big to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to post any reserved information online - this would be to publish it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is just as obvious that with current technologies, it is in vain to hope to be able to maintain confidential reports over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved relations be maintained in the future?
I know well that for the moment my prediction is science fiction and therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly in diligence to uncontrollable routes, bearing only messages learned by heart or, at the most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a single copy in closed drawers: at the bottom, the Watergate spy attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wired telegraph.
The (analog) videos allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backward and uncovering all the secrets of editing, while now the (digital) CDs only allow to skip from chapter to chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travel it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not surprising that the policies and communications techniques relate to horseback riding cars.
One last observation.
In the past, the press was trying to figure out what was going on in the secret of the embassies.
The embassies are now asking the press for confidential information.
Climate: How France Disrupts its Financing Promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to review the delivery of the promises of early-start or early-start financing made by developed countries.
And the big French bidding is revealed.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (420 million a year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU took the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the actions of its member states, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation is appreciable and appreciated in its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of accuracy.
The EU has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, under the Copenhagen Agreement, "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional effort is made without being to the detriment of Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered the year 2009 as a reference: international financing is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or the overall level of Public Development Assistance.
Concretely, the total amount of France’s support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to meet its commitment in terms of “new and additional” financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that 1 € loaned is equivalent to 1 € given.
Obviously, this is hardly justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to mitigation of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is wrong to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to one euro that is given... At the most, it should only be counted under its commitments as the cost of the loan for the lender country (the borrower).
But France has nothing to do with such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (otherwise) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts 1 euro to meet its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
Nice passport!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of action over time and on the other on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, it can make it appear that it spends €420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would other Member States continue to give if enough to lend?) and in negotiations since the developing countries are not completely dumb...
The Early Financing Chapter is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be another grain of sand in the immense machine that is UNFCCC.
Hopefully this is not the case.
In any case, lessons learned from this first year of early financing are essential.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But most importantly, France could push forward discussions on the long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the method of accounting for loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope therefore lies in the new Minister of the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be of nature to increase the level of international trust necessary to advance the discussions.
Alert to pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old ingested 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (formerly Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the issue treated", bought between July and September the foods usually consumed in four meals and one snack in a day by a child about a ten-year-old, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as treats, have been examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The record is overwhelming: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as potential or likely carcinogens and five are classified as certain carcinogens as well as 37 substances that can act as endocrine disruptors (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
“Although, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, it is clear in our investigation that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is concerning,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proven to be certain carcinogens as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, has traces of six chemical substances, a fungicide of which is prohibited in France.
The same goes for Kenyan green beans, included in lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even bread stick and chewing gum were truffled with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt from it.
The ultimate risk to the consumer of this “contaminant cocktail” “is likely underestimated,” according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "the urgency of the situation" to impose a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
