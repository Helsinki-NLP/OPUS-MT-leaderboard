European inflation slipped into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the vertiginous rise in food prices.
The rise in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 countries of the euro area, recording - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent, the Luxembourg-based Union Bureau of Statistics announced.
Official forecasts were only 3% likely, Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuer banks, did not cut the basic interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with the rising prices of commodities and the reduction of forced unemployment, would lead to a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least near two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: “We have to negotiate” on inflation so that it does not subsequently have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke the 12-year record, while in Spain it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation shot up in the euro area as a result of galoping food and energy prices.
Wheat term quotes increased by 88 percent and soybean quotes reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market rose this year by 52 percent, reaching black gold nearly $100 per barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while by 2009 it will decline to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent in the next 3 or 4 months, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup expects a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by the beginning of December support from the Young Democrats Alliance increased significantly, reaching its peak level since 2002, while the Gallup never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of Socialists.
The difference in the case of secure party voters – due to the increased firmness of opposition voters – would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) of the support of a fifth of the socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the necessary limit to have any parliamentary scan: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the secure voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous lowest – it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country’s economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is fairly bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As far as the next year is concerned, the majority of the population is experiencing the deterioration of the situation and only one-tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those surveyed, higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of Government performs his duties rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány heavily, while Viktor Orbán is supported by 38 percent of respondents.
54 percent of the population does not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent does not trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year 35 percent estimated that it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, this proportion is currently only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation responded that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said they would likely participate.
In comparison, "a general election to be held on Sunday" would surely participate only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believe it is likely to participate. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 percent of the population would disapprove of the payment of education fees, 79 percent of the medical consultation service and 84 percent of hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the secure participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of studies rights, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has fivefold its prices
The average price rise of 16 percent was maintained by hypermarkets in the Budaörs Gold Trade Triangle, with the difference that the VAT has not been increased this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold trading triangle the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above 1,000 HUF.
As in December last year prices in food supermarkets had already "fired", there was no dramatic increase in percentage compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously terrifying for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below HUF 9,000, today they can’t do it for even ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded with a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 that basket cost HUF 6,800.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the same level as the previous year, but there was a sharp rise in turkey breast filet, nut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we also found a kilogram of bread for the price of HUF 139.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with a two-liter redeemable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, in the basket of Napi Auchan it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our estimates, compared to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora rose by 15, while Tesco and Auchan rose by about 18 percent the prices in Napi’s basket.
Comparing the values of last year’s most expensive basket with that of this year’s cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was HUF 1206, so that during Christmas last year in prices the increase in VAT was felt.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visiblely unable to make a decision on the price margin to be applied for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the merchant poorly plans the speed of a product’s circulation, it may lose a significant profit on the margin that adjusts to the volume of sales.)
The rise in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which was the most expensive with HUF 1720 higher than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was just HUF 844.
Such extremes did not occur this year, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, with hypermarkets growing more than 30 percent in the price of first-need consumer goods.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Office of Statistics: this office, in the case of some foodstuffs of first need, recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent over the 12-month interval.
So, for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the Napi basket, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case only a 10 percent price increase.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic price increase even on multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain about the golden trade triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers in the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, carrying the preserved food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning, the three stores formed large queues in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that in-country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to survey institutes because incomes are below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in that of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants
Several thousand infections have been registered in hospitals this year due to the improper use of antibiotics.
The prevailing hygiene circumstances in hospitals, overcrowded beds and staff overload do not favor the control of infections - says the physician department chief of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago a MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred at the same hospital earlier this year.
One injured from a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient soon after he had to return to the hospital as a result of the contagion with MRSA and since then no major surgery has been performed due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10 this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection caused by multiresistant agents have been recorded in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System - said Karolina Böröcz, physician-head of department at the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections caused by multiresistant agents has surely been recorded, for the rest there is no information.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
A third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once exaggerated or improperly applied to antibiotics, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics turn into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and quickly infect under inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, e.g. wound infections or sepsis in the first place for patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, for patients with the weakened body, for the elderly or for people with low weight.
In the opinion of the physician-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotic resistant
“These patients are isolated, nursing staff cares for them in rubber gloves and mask and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so infection can not be avoided in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of formation and contagion with multiresistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not in fashion.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases come out in the public when MRSA infections already occur in the patient,” said the physician-head of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes rigorous entrustments for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for treating infections and pathological conditions.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be done to prevent drug resistance from occurring, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less common in ambulant patients or in basic care,” said Karolina Böröcz.
Save with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, they play a very important role in the washing of hands, the use of rubber gloves and masks, however also in this sense considerable faults are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is infected by droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated by at least a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favourable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a higher chance of infection.
In the opinion of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are met, fewer such infections are recorded or the contagion of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
Treating MRSA is a huge expenditure for the National Disease Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fighting.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The program appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a declining trend in England.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multiresistant agents (including MRSA) and that of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Denial of police commander’s alcoholemia control that caused a deadly accident
The official expert report on the case of the deadly accident caused by the police commander of the XXII district has been made.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a stunned state can be excluded by the resigned police commander of the XXII district, who on Tuesday struck and caused the death of a passing person, said Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the Attorney General’s Office of the Capital, after preparing the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the outcome of the primary alcoholemia control that had already found that the former police commander did not drink alcohol before standing behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle folding into Kossuth Lajos Street of the XXII district, struck a 55-year-old man who intended to cross the street, but not in the pedestrian-designated area.
(This latter fact, i.e., that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the regulations of the Traffic Code are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give up the passage when folding.)
The passenger lost his life after being hospitalized.
The district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because it shook him greatly.
The investigation of the case is in charge of the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said the former police commander from the outset collaborated with prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
€400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit limit agreements worth €400 million in total in Budapest on Friday to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of €300 million to finance the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection projects, which will be implemented from the cohesion funds grant, of which the parties had previously signed a credit contract worth €100 million, the contract they have just signed refers to the use of the remaining €200 million.
The €150 million credit contract is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective from Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract for €50 million for innovations, which the budget will mainly spent on the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th Metro Line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary finalizes the details of the financing of the Metro with the EU, they will re-deal with the issue whether or not it is necessary to amend the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this could take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth €8.4 billion.
The interest of the credits is in line with the EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, without charge for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all of Europe is directed towards that previously mentioned Balkan country.
What thing, where and who buys in the EU’s even cheaper market, will rise quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred destination for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly Bulgaria, with its cheap ski slopes apartments and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while on the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country – such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – will arouse interest from real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
In the same way, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, so it can be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and traditionally there are many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups – says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50,000 and 100,000 euros or old houses in poor condition between 5,000 and 15,000 euros, to renovate them later.
They require good communication and access, in addition to them is important the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor.
Buyers of chalets are the second category (Bulgaria in December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent.
The rise in the price of real estate significantly outperforms the growth in wages.
Fodor and the Six by Hundreds of Hungarians
As reported by Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor, the expert-level meetings will end Tuesday and Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue negotiations at the minister-level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Roadmap on post-emissions reduction efforts, set out in the Kyoto Protocol, which is in effect until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the particular issues between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not want to negotiate on accurate figures at the moment, although it tends to reach an agreement that compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020 the emissions of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
A further agreement was reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF).
Six for hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 level, regardless of whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed and is willing to commit itself to decrease even by 30 percent if the other large developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in accordance with their responsibilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signatories to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol pledged to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states pledged to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will fulfill, notes the Ministry of the Environment’s press release.
This is a lot at stake in Bali, since within two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because otherwise it is sure that its entry into force would be postponed after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, whose need was warned in its latest IPCC scientific report.
As a result, the reduction in emissions would be delayed and a rise of more than 2°C of the Earth’s average temperature could not be prevented, which scientists say would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
The British army units at a video distributor post recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos of their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in the Kandahar General Operations Corps, then sent to London to be loaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from air force soldiers that have been loaded this way to the Internet and its "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
The air force had originally loaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to present the public the true goal of the British army's presence abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs virtually nothing compared to conventional television recruitment spots - defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the accurately edited and censored recordings, there are also amateur videos on the distributor, for example about the deaths of the soldiers: in the propaganda films "officials", a little hypocritical, officers speak of maximum losses, without presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos recorded in real operations have already been uploaded to the Internet, but the British army is only lately taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with freely downloadable shooting video games, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can get directly instead of the soldiers.
Salt trombone and cake at the Christmas party of ministries
Labour Minister Monika Lamperth doesn’t seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to fire the year 2007 with salt cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with tombola and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - this is how power is fun.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held at the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
On the Christmas of the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, and for the Christmas of the Missionaries, the relatives of the soldiers who currently carry out missions abroad will be invited.
This portfolio will allocate $25 million to the holiday atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Agency for Promotion (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transportation (MET) will celebrate a luxurious party regarding the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held at the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and the six hundred ministry workers are expected to be around three hundred and fifty.
At the wallet party a Christmas atmosphere will reign, artists will also perform and there will be a tombola draw.
The Christmas of the ANF cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice Administration (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rental of the hall cost a million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers in one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Center for Economic Development of Community funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Teatro de la Comedia.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we are unable to contact the competent person.
Can be attended without suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the Lucy Day Dance on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s greeting words and after dinner there was live dance music.
In answer to [origo]’s question they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear suit or evening dress.
The health, work and local government portfolios are preparing for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of HUF 400,000.
Instead, Labour Minister Monika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
The participation of one hundred and eighty guests will - as reported by the press department - only drink coffee and salty cake, so the party will not cost more than HUF 350 000.
Instead, local government minister Gordon Bajnai will simply have a toast with his colleagues in the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall of events with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of HUF 2500 per guest - from this budget the reception will be paid with a buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers every year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year's reception on January 20, at the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as the portfolio reported, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the 100 guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech by the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments told [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio they were not able to report on the budget of the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the festival that will be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will form a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s indefinite strike.
A protest gathering will be held on Saturday, while Monday – the day the final vote on the public health law – will begin unemployment.
This action will certainly cause major difficulties in transport, since railway transit will be completely stopped and workers at the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike until 13:00.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike to be held jointly with the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions.
It will also constitute the strike committee of the LIGA and the National Trade Union of Machinists that will coordinate the actions on Monday.
A protest rally will be held on Saturday, while on Monday the participating trade unions will be on strike for an indefinite period, if a deal with the government is not reached.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
Based on the National Assembly's Monday agenda, it is also possible that only public health law will be voted at very early hours in the evening, or maybe near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning a portion of Budapest’s collective transportation and more than half of the intercity bus transportation of the Volán companies may be stopped.
At the same time, in many parts of the country there will be closure of half of the roadways.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League website.
Some unions announced their indefinite strike, others for defined time.
Until Thursday afternoon the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Rail Workers (SLTF) were unable to reach an agreement even on minimum services, although, as Christmas parties approach, more and more people travel on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 13 hours the workers of the Collective Transport Company of Budapest, the airports of Budapest from 7 to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike the Unions of LIGA of the Electrical Industry and Thermal Energy, the 2nd Educational Unions and the 2nd Educational Unions called to a strike of Education.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Health and Social Workers’ Union (SDTSSS) which is part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Rail Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Trade Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard increases the risk in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Hungarian Better Movement, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
In the company's "warning on risks" it writes: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that "with the aggravation of ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsies population of Hungary, even in the short term violent ethnic clashes may occur".
The main reason for this is that the Hungarian Guard’s political strategy is likely to be the provocation of an event of this nature,” added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the Roma problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groupings, who were able to base their political strategy on the discrepancies between Gypsies and Hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, as a result of the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that: since autumn 2006, the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and momentum, and that since the summer of 2007, numerous organizations have been formed in the country that define themselves as "national self-defense associations".
"The common trait of these groupings is that they define themselves as civilian organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), referring to the inaptitudes of the police, the army, i.e. the state."
They affirmed: all this happens in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighborhood relations.
“In recent months, in numerous neighboring states they referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungary policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard operates in a way similar to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive gypsy riots that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the organization's objective is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has sparked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it has been written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain Gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that also Hungarian Roma react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - you can read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
The research director of Political Capital, Attila Juhász, to the news agency’s question said: Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change in risk, they inform the public, as it happened in this case, publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers.
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around holidays - that next year will be less - work days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or North America are feasts united.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national holidays, state holidays and holidays.
The holidays are mainly related to religious holidays and historical ephemerals.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that those who have spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the 1848 revolution and October 23, commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the foundation of the State, on May 1st the feast of work, on November 1st and 2nd we remind our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country are two-day holidays the Easter of the Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, which is why it is often bridged when before or after the holiday there is a single working day.
In exchange for the extended weekends so, on the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labour that regulates in his specific decree when work is to be done exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or post-festival.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory for companies and services institutions who, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during holidays.
This year the order of work can only be altered around the holidays of the year: from December 24, life in the country is practically stopped, as according to experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First the agenda around the work party will be changed so that then, for four consecutive days, the workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26th will be working day, so in return Friday, May 2nd will be holiday day.
The other change is related to the October 23 feast: on Saturday, October 18, we will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, the next year will be able to rest during the holiday of the year, since from 24 December it will work almost nowhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to bitter your colleagues’ lives
E-mails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: all of them are part of our everyday Folklore at work.
It is necessary to decide whether you adapt to small discomforts or consciously avoid confusing situations that can irritate others.
Tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were searched for from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go to a date?
At best, you feel it and try to fix the issue, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message to you (this is the least common solution).
Most of the time the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding with embarrassing explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than when you want to pick up a document, an office utility or your phone and you can’t find them.
Remember yesterday you put the stapler on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don’t take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will be angry with you for taking away their things.
Do not take envelopes or post-it from the office because it can be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they run out before time.
Are you joking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what is he doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don’t pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about your colleagues’ private lives!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Build in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, even though others also know the things about him.
Are you unjustified on sick leave?
When you call the office and say that you are sick and your head hurts unbearably, you feel bad or good, you feel like that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your duties, your work in terms.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, communicate with them, so that your colleagues or your boss will not have to confront you the next day.
Tarareos, laughs, phone calls
Are you involved in your job, but are you suddenly getting your colleagues’ laughs out of it?
Have you unintentionally heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your tarareos, songs, talks aloud (less when you do them above their head), kickings, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent aloud.
All of these can be annoying, even though they are not deepening at the moment in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you haven’t finished something in time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don’t alud to the eventually reigning chaos in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your fault!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: Very comfortable habit for the home, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be dismantled, respect your colleagues and yourself wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation requires it!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning jam.
It sounds a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'll raise the volume.
It changes the rhythm of the music and to the earlier tones is added the bass and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national music life didn’t mislead us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this jam seems totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are gradually changing the image and although again the rock style garage is in fashion, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are innovations under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the set of Yonderboi until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for cinematographic soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc Török Szezon).
The wider audience knew the ensemble that initially performed only in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected its first album released in 2002 among the top fifty national records, ranking Zagar, along with Yonderboi as nearly the only national trend former, able to sell also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his set are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they tastefully wear this label.
The set reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The newly released album, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will be able to open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Balázs Zságer.
It’s fine the reference about the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared – according to the spirit and trend of the time – the guitar that sounds louder, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album on the Millennials György Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a true hit of the mr2 channel Petõfi, which lately broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This broadcast brought the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground") to the ears of the listeners.
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success arises the question: the one you are playing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of select audience to me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can equally be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of listeners also works in this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the acceptance of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has bigger traditions.
There not only the 15- and 20-year-olds attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: I naturally feel good to see more and more people attend our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is felt in concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and did his career rather west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t go his way, even though they sometimes try to compare our music to his.
We rather work in a team, trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable for them to compare our work with the music of Yonderboi, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: In the hit list of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard Zagar’s name in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open in this style to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn’t intend to compose big hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main motive?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good-voice soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that six-women choir - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - which was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like that or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in an instrumental version and when we had all the material on the record, we thought something was still missing.
The chord attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that was later learned by the girls.
Everything came practically to the first attempt and incredibly spontaneously.
I remember, I was very excited then, but naturally I needed the Divas as well.
With my voice it wouldn’t have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both at the concert and on the album it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay’s brief solo), they don’t have their own role, they all sing together and not louder than music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
They are also on stage in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are at the bottom simply for technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute soloist papers.
The song also verses on it, that we forget our ego for a while, that who from where he came and where he goes, let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted to make others also feel that euphoric mood we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: Which one did you devote the most work to?
Zs.B.: In the music composition actually no, rather when it comes to mixing, there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to run the groove and then little by little everything got in its place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I've already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
Traitor Stock Broker Risks Billions for His Inferiority Complex
A disloyal evildoer.
This is how he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Générale, who also owns the Czech Bank of Commerce.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and undoubtedly with good abilities.
He intuited a long time ago, unlike all major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same who sent him to the police.
But what comes from Kerviel’s responses according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his businesses.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he said in his replies.
In the summer, he managed to win 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity has already seen it come early in the year.
In February, we started hearing some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel didn’t believe it and bet right.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
"When I earned my first 500 million I didn't know how to notify," Kerviel said, adding that nothing was left for himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that he did not reach his discovery.
He even deceived the bosses, even when the Eurex Stock Exchange began to be interested in his business.
Risk became a benefit
Was he afraid that he would be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had earned $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did he get so much willingness to take such a risk?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after completing his studies in Lyon.
Their annual salary was managed at $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stock broker and in 2005 he became a stock broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I would never win as much as others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I have noticed that they were looking at me with caution.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares of Allianz, he won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this meant a starting mechanism, and wanted more.
If you win, we leave you
“It’s like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew about all this or rather suspected it.
"While I made money, they closed their eyes."
Only then came the coup earlier this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all of his footprints.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost $5 billion because of it.
And how did they get to locate him?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The corridor who has no vacation is a corridor who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his file,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the chance to get 365 billion
The Czech government ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can get €14 billion (approximately €365 billion).
This is almost half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of the seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion crowns will be available for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will be spent on transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transportation Program is the largest of the operational programmes and accounts for up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state transport infrastructure fund, which next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Business and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should seek funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly entering countries that uses them least.
Twenty-year penalty for the former president of Nicaragua, court ordered
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday decreed a 20-year sentence for the country’s former president, Arnaldo Aleman, who was convicted in 2003 for the loss of $100 billion (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Nevertheless, a while later, he was released from jail to pass to house arrest in his estate not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is unclear at the moment, according to the AP agency, that the then Central American head of state between 1197 and 2002 will be back in bars.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will rather depend on the prison officers if they let German end his punishment at home or if they make him return to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German was constantly transferring money from the government to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fictional and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that German created to fund his campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how we approved the budget.
That's right.
The State Budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not afford not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential, approved the new law with tranquility.
It's a big paradox.
Every government begins and ends with each chapter and departure of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The state budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three shortcomings that by this year 2008 cannot be solved so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of presidents that are not only pensions but also social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second of these is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the public funding deficit, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the highest risk lies not in the State Budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clockwork bomb, however, lies in the municipal and community budget deficit.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, fees and credits of banks, often issued, meaningless, obligations to which they disproportionately indebted to their councils.
In recent years they have managed to repay these debts through the mass sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
Currently they do not have this resource.
If we only adhere to official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, is going through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, as ČSSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put order on state finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to be indebted.
The other countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have unnecessarily swollen with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform will not change then it will be the true end of any policy in this country and, whoever governs will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who rule will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money from retirement taxes and social benefits.
That’s why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending on presidential spending.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We do not want politicians who rule to become only officials so we must be patient and grant this weak government coalition, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is capable of getting from taxes and fees, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
In the Monetary Marking, more than $100 billion will be received through tenders.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates for which they are able to lend money.
For example, the American Fed will send to bid $40 billion, and then another twenty-four billion will be facilitated by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report to clients.
“This coordinated action by central banks likely decreased recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what still awaits them when they decided to take this step,” said ABN Amro’s lead economist Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear they will have the same problems with access to loans and will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the American economy into recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR fee, London interbank fee used for the loan of money in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow money even when the central banks of the U.S., Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the move taken by central banks will help ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change affects mostly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again addressed the issue of global warming.
Criticism now emerged with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
“There debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy to discover his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I find only the cartoon of my ideas."
Now interested parties can find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists about the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
Furthermore, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of the present he repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental advocates but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driving license
The date was passed to six hundred thousand drivers and they did not succeed in changing their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change for officials to give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will be found on the roads without the valid license.
According to traffic, the license has not changed primarily those who no longer want to drive.
While in villages they announce a rapid decline in card change, metropolitan offices are filled with applications and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates around 2,000 daily customers.
In the queues, half an hour is waited.
In Prague, the new license has not yet been issued for about 140,000 drivers.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid license will risk a fine starting in January.
The offender will pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
The police can fix the offence with a warning.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will amount to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information, a person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices for moderate entry of fines of up to a thousand crowns.
According to the vowel of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, driving license is a document in which people can decide whether or not they want it.
It is not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who don’t want to drive should give the driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will need to gradually change the other types of driving licenses.
People with the document from 1994 to 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalty of Berdych’s complicit detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in jail.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided the reduction of the penalties, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
Detectives in the Prague department against organized crime were initially going to fall between 14 and 12 years old.
The decision of today can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also in charge in this case, but he is first awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
In other cases, he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't get more.
In January, the District Court acknowledged the involvement of 19 people in the robbery and the upper court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accused’s accusations were rejected by the investigation because they were invented cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their robbery to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment relates to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to the theft, their victims suffered serious impacts on their health but are also accused of abuse of power as public officials and without gun permits.
In the home record, police found guns, steel core ammunition, a laser steering machine and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
Except for nearly twenty men in this trial, the court has already acknowledged Berdych and other accused guilty.
Other men related to Berdych's case are still declaring other processes, and in some causes they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have for now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their handover to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One Account to Change Children: 12 Million
For changing children in the maternity house the lawyer of the families affected, Igor Veleba, wants from the Třebič hospital 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the fathers, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, does not in principle agree with Veleba’s proposal.
“Such a demand we don’t approve, it’s too high,” Dostal said after today’s meeting.
“In order to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the specialist’s report that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescissive value.
We stay in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostál said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, the Jabloň family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, one million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depths.
The stress situation was best endured by men although they fought with reproaches for the change of girls.
Women get worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Třebič maternity house last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákovy to Příbyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
Vysočina Governor Miloš Vystrčil delivered in late October 100,000 crowns to each family as compensation expenses for the mistake made at the Třebič hospital administered by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liabilities for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reserve fund and can extraordinarily seek help from the administrator.
The court has so far acknowledged a proportionally low compensation, sums calculated according to tables counting in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Polívka lost the lawsuit over the Kingdom of Wallachia brand.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava he was the first to use the Kingdom of Valaquia brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka did not appear today at the oral hearing.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone gets the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea has Harabiš as well.
“We’ve been after us for about ten years of work.
Search for money and invention of activities,” he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit lies in the money.
“After years, I realized that the project was successful and that it could be something for me as well.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, the Kingdom of Wallachia brand was first used by Polívka on his television show.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about guiding him towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš thought of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From this comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabiš later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to his farm visitors and attendees to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also ruled that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who were fully dedicated to it.
The collaboration, among the today broken parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation in Vsetin for Polívka.
From then on there began conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, the forever elected".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš's mediation, derived from the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as mother queen.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society which has to date been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with their princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
He didn’t want to disclose any more data or dates.
“We have no rush.
It would have to be something like the king's path to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected at a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present himself," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: biases overcome
I never liked the Peugeotu 206.
Its drive characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is his successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the space of the head in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer from two meters in length.
Flying around the world
I walk through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value the design invention more, although the car already looks pretty elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backs.
Also unlike the model 206, the side direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the body have grown.
In the Combi the said shortage of space in the header disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This must be valued as very accessible (thanks to the foldable rear door) and a well distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not bother, and can be extended to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in the basic regime it has a capacity of 428 litres which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find out that the Peugeot is behind with its noticeable 52 litres.
On vacation abroad or when placing the child’s stroller, their value is critical.
But if I had to comment positively then I must quote the floor that is quite flat after dropping the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to say the truth, that's how a 1600 should look that would despise the family five doors.
It is quiet, consumes little and, above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the Škoda era of then that seemed as if the exhaust tube was stopped by a cloth, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with 1400 injection ignition for 329,900 crowns, you can still.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only that we would still have airbag in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but count on the team’s add-ons in the Fabia and it will reach a pretty similar number.
Now it is only left to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools children from Eastern European countries attend, and therefore locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and Native children increase in violence.
The problem of integrating Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where conflicts between natives and Slovak migrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and gossip among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was sticking a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In her defense she said the girl was insulting her son with racist-tone insults.
Police also had to act after an attack by two minor girls on a Slovak migrant.
The girls packed him with racist insults and threw stones on him.
"When we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave it, he didn’t want to throw us apples and pears, and then he dropped his pants and showed us his ass,” she described another nasty incident for The Times, the Slovak student’s mother.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with Eastern European migrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above show us how the atmosphere in English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is truly the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be accomplished, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, large waves or a quiet sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the whole enclosed with bartenders offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island finds you still much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all islands in the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called her, the most beautiful place human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew in the late 1920s.
He ordered one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, to build it, since everything that was criminal in the U.S. (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana tall buildings emerged, by wide avenues racing cars that were a symbol of worship in the 1950s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought an estate in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio left their signatures the stars of the world of the show and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Abanense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, cocktails are mixed according to your wishes.
And those already cult cars of the 1950s, until today, continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have rustled between these damp and salt winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old neighborhood, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money needed, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by rail lovers.
Sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow tracks on steam or electrical machines.
Their carriages for tens of years were not discovered and are now there, machines that work and whose brotherly models in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The most well-known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the aforementioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, should not fail to visit.
The Viñales valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation growing in limestone lands.
Mogots, limestone pillars and steep rocks in the falls of the valley, and in its caves fertile lands are acclimatized thanks to which roquedales are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the Havana cigar factories you can find your final product.
Maybe someone seems interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinidad
Old abolengo city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers who arrived later, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Sierra de Escambray, is a place so remote that even in the 1950s of the last century there was no road that would connect it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than just one afternoon, it is worth exploring interesting places in the vicinity such as Ancón Beach or the sugar factory valley.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which with its music animates the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town on the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (it is actually a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the best known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pines, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron of Cuba, the Virgin of Copper Charity, the Santeria, African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, of all these could be filled many pages.
However, as it is said, it’s best to see it ever.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment are influencing the mission's progress in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not working as thought, in Edinburgh (Scotland) the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country coincided.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states are discussing allied plans and coordination.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to increase activity, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development alone,” Defence Minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to US military data is higher than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions grew compared to last year by 27 percent, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, one-quarter of whom are in the south of the territory.
For the United States, however, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
They exactly ask for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and in heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of soldiers and equipment that we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months prevails the controversy of whether all allies do their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized.
“The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the demands of fighting there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The sensational newspaper Sun, this week, called the German soldiers vague.
“The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are devoted to playing while our boys fight,” Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph where the British troop played a rugby game in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach a billion in 2009
For every Czech, the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt amounted to 842.7 billion crowns in September.
This year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion Crowns thanks to improved developments in the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic’s state debt grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased 13.4 billion crowns.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state’s debt in early October.
For every Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state was indebted more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could cross the trillion crown border until 2009.
Next year the debt is expected to move between 900 billion and the trillion crowns,” Patria Finance economist David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance economist Vladimír Pikora says: “We could spend the billion in 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If the situation on the political scene changed and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see such a change,” he added.
Doubt grows
The debt of the state creates debt in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
State debt is paid through treasury bonds, state bonds, direct credits or, for example, European Investment Bank loans.
The state’s domestic indebtedness grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
Foreign debt has grown from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter creates 13 percent, which is enormous given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from bonds where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the State’s payments and debt management strategy for 2007 it is drawn that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Earlier in December, the ministry decreased the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to improved developments in the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
The remainder consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech consolidation agency with about 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payment, 43 billion crowns to finance state bonds and 1.8 billion crowns in payments from the European Investment Bank’s loans.
He was comparing Jartum in court today for giving a name to a teddy bear.
The British professor tried in Sudan for insult to Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartum to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of having allowed students aged 6 to 7 to give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear when any representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
It was punishable by a punishment of whips.
This 54-year-old British school teacher at Unity High School in Jartúm in Sudan, was detained at her home on Sunday and charged with attacks on Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back to September, when this teacher asks her 6/7-year-old students to choose a name for the class’s teddy bear.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouths, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their favorite name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class with the bear's photo with the following legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself did not carry any tag with this name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I'm only sorry that I asked the children to vote for a name," it is according to him only a "innocent error."
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her students " and " she never speaks of religion in class " ..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday, during the last negotiation session in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo ended a sixth session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their divergences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake," its American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not anticipate violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go a last time Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90%-populated Albanian province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troic was commissioned by the UN for a new mediation last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this date.
"Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Kharchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in her favor.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced the president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where these "last-opportunity negotiations" were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has taken part in his regrets.
But he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade “belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations.”
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has regarded a compromise as always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said it particularly feared a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto right.
" The parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations have lasted for two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made " in consultation " with the Westerners.
Bush starts agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference gathered by himself on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a common declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old litigation between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything he can to help them conclude a “peace treaty” by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle " the terrorist infrastructure " and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, recalling both sides' obligations regarding the itinerary for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all pending issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This denomination covers the three main petty issues of the Israeli-Palestinian litigation: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the U.S. President, Abbas insisted that upcoming negotiations be "global and deepened" and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things."
On his return to the tribune, Olmert pledged that the upcoming negotiations would be “direct and continuous” and that he would “make an effort to conclude them in the course of 2008.”
At the end of 2008, Bush set the end of the implementation of his " vision of two coexisting Palestinian and Israeli States " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved a commitment on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks “a point of confrontation in Middle Eastern history, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” said Prince Saoud in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As every time in this kind of events, official versions and rumors oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the French National Police General Inspection (IGPN) investigation, a police car circulated on Sunday, shortly after 17 o’clock, at Villiers-le-Bel.
"I was not in intervention but in patrol, and was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating beacon," a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, i.e. unauthorized to travel on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " all-gas " .
"It hit the police car on the left side, after a failure to cede the passage to the right," the police said.
The alcoholemia control practiced on vehicle occupants was revealed to be negative.
The condition of the car (the defounded front, cracked windshield, ripped bumper) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Attorney General of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into "involuntary homicide and refusal of aid " to the IGPN, cocoged with the departmental public security management of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the attorney stated that the investigation of the IGPN, at this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on his left."
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the rubbing of the footwear on the ground, showed that both vehicles had stayed inside the car the time for the police car to come to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
Both victims' bodies were autopsed yesterday.
What happened right afterwards?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing aid to both young people.
IGPN, being prudent, would also remove " any serious fault " in this respect.
"It is the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more investigation, on which one must be very prudent," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness of these moments that followed the accident.
One of the windows that looks at the scene.
"We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to revive them," this witness says.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw "a completely scared policeman, who limped.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young people, the room was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that people were present of the unexpected situation of the youth, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, relief came " about twenty minutes after the police departure " .
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that police services did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor stressed.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken in the context of the state of emergency have been injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter replicated with stone shots, wounding police.
At least 350 lawyers have been detained.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and wounded lawyers.
Many would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers demanded a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyer movement collected on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president " urged the population to send flowers to the judges who pronounced against the state of emergency and the waste to whom they swore before Musharraf " .
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly referred to the exceptional measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
In the coming days it had to take a decision on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election on October 6 to indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been eliminated and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court rulings,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "values no more" after the establishment of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem declared on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by November 15, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned to residence by his deputy chief of armies.
More than one-third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Different contraceptive methods such as the pill or the sterilet still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better "domination of fertility," according to the institute that notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight in ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated slightly more or less a month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) will have needed more than seven hours of work in space to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel that is indispensable to continue the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "capped" by the astronauts to make the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday that astronauts had released from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a cylindrical thick piece in charge of hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories soon (see frame).
This module is a type of landing scaffold for modules-laboratories.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew’s second task was to displace a electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present at the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After having displaced it, the crew began rearrangement of the module’s solar panels with a width of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, has been damaged in just about a meter or less by a wire that trapped.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to damage the panel anymore.
The astronauts, who had to initially perform a control exit from the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to snail at the end of the 30 meters long remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform repair.
It is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
High, sturdy, very skillful, has highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been in charge of "operating" the "wounded" solar panel.
After inspecting precisely the damage, he cut the faulty cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been assisted by the second spacewalker who had stayed near the air lock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey stick wrapped with insulator to prevent electrocution on solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and "capped" by astronauts on board the station.
Upon completion of the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning inside the station.
In the afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a midday rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle for their return to Earth scheduled on Wednesday.
The EADS Title Sanctioned in Stock Exchange
The EADS share is currently sharply down on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group has announced that it will tend to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its forecast of operational outcome for 2007 in response to delays caused by the slow progression of the engine development of the A400M, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," the parent house of European builder EADS announced.
Due to these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new operating outcome targets (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results on Thursday, it adds without any further encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that the operational outcome of EADS failed at 86 per cent in 2006, essentially due to loads linked to delays in another programme, that of the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group anticipated a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The Choice of the Status Quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the outset of the polls: the Russians are going to opt massively for President Putin’s party, united Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends to voters a televised message about public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as a leader of the list for the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proves to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president left nothing transparent receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with delivering a new burden against the West accused of interference - his theme of preference during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents,” he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign undermined by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there have never been "so dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsin."
Following the crackdown on demonstrations last weekend, former world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections stand two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful United Russia party who would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in the legislative elections as in the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mindset of the homo sovieticus, they don't feel owner of their fate," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg dates back further: civil society late in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin restored the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic disengagement," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “renounce by their own will the personal responsibility” of those who had briefly proved after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of every 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of the united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "What to reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen’s Nazi archives, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million documents of files, stored over 27 km of shelves to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far not accessible only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of a former victim or his right-holders.
The eleven states in charge of its management – such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to searchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research "particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health status of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as supposed homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the deported or subjected countrymen in compulsory work and, eventually, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin, said in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade now reaches about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are hoping to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
The European Union’s foreign ministers gave their approval to the European Commission last April to begin negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free-trade pact will greatly dope both economies” and “India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans,” justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants exchange annually for " 47 billion euros of goods " and for " ten billion euros of services "diplomatic presence of the President of the European Union ", said the Prime Minister Danièle Smadja, head of the delegation of the European Commission in New Delhi, feeling that the bilateral trade "and India has not yet reached its potential in the Union".

The Bank of England takes note of concerns offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to alleviate the current turn of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds to the 5.75% base index in five weeks, an unusual duration offer.
"In order to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected input of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on December 6 in the form of an open market operation for five weeks."
The bank specifies that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market thus on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, the base index and until 10 January.
It is the first time that the UK BoE bank seems to put liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is "prepared to take further measures to keep interbank loan index " up-to-date in line with its base index.
The daily interbank index on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The rate after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had dissuaded banks from resorting to that.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange of the pound relative to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC parties deny review of PS party proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist law proposal on purchasing power, equivalent to a dismissal of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, among which the 50% increase in the payroll for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (internal rate per oil products), a check-transport or rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Asemblea next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the developer/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more or less, the current movement of festivals in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 at a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the direction of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he's ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to give the region a European-style event-festival.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as our marketplace and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we stagnate in lower-class policies because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional site that lately tends to Philadelphia.
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after unmarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a country festival, while ours are held rather in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a country festival impression in the European and urban way in the American way.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow investing in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offering for this festival is "very big", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been released to the groups, but nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under press.
“Vineland will taste rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie dishes to Montreal when nothing but Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runway productions."
Is it difficult to compete with the Governor?
“We need to be cautious, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer those that will judge the best,” he says.
The race to the festivals
For the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nonetheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race to the Oskars is started.
All festivals on the West Coast, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them value and make sure that the directors do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good picture at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on poster in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be end-of-year stock market rally? Experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to dismiss the closing of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the traditional end-of-year rally to arrive.
However, experts are not as clear this year that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange usually has a positive behaviour.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based solely on statistics, especially because in the current context, uncertainties in the markets, at least in the short term.
Though they are not supporters that the stock exchange will run in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that “the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing toward quality securities in both long and short segments.”
Therefore, they believe the exchange will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "mostly because the impact of the likely decline of the Fed's rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, chief sales officer of BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to venture to say that there will be rally.
“There’s not the thing for many joys,” the expert says.
The Ibex has lost nearly 4% from the highs scored on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year at these dates.
However, the expert says things will be a bit different this year as he believes the rally will go ahead of the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, says we are close to technical levels and “so we could see a rebound of the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the U.S. as to the consequences of the crisis in the credit market.”
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be in charge of bringing the Ibex to new peak quotas.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year is about the great values."
The expert would include the two big banks and some builders in the portfolio "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Inversis Bank assures that the rises will come from the hands of the banking and the industrial sector.
Constructors will also be able to benefit from this rally, if it happens.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other builders like Ferrovial and FCC to follow their path,” explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the past seven years, on only two occasions December has been a bassist month.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, when stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the crack of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (currently the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and if it manages to count on its end-of-year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew much of its offices.
A total of 200, the ones located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a huge change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decides to make the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20:30 in the afternoon, and open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20:30 in the afternoon.
Another group that has also repeatedly repeatedly wanted to extend the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to point or not to this initiative that follows the schedules of the shops.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture private customers who move through these areas to make their shopping, to SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling of existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches that it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, Ángel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not mean a major investment, although if a greater hiring of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per location to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía of Madrid have been chosen, and seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specializing in immigrants, also with very broad schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax premises they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” says Rivero.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've done it.'
With that sentence he expressed his satisfaction yesterday Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain that runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect damned his joy: ‘It’s what hurts me, not because we’ve grown more, but because we’ve gone down less.’
Still, he emphasized that in a weak market, “we have fallen less.”
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That gain places its loss in what we have carried this year at 15.66%.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and shared by Vocento (other 13%) thus reaches 4.488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday ceded 1.52% and accumulated a 40.5% drop since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (editor of Five Days) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenue, according to Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s subsidiary advertising management.
If this announced fact becomes real, the television channel would record this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising revenue compared to the 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, net revenue of Antena 3 rose 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million), while net revenue of television rose 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution in the Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría shared 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
“We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol."
According to analysts, the market gives samples at these times of some tiredness.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
It is explained that the expected revenue growth has been cut from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company has lowered the Antena 3 profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 reviews
One.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities based primarily on their high dividend return and long-term sustainable potential.
Two.
Caja Madrid: see Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (maintain) for the 'multiple attractions' and rise of the business.
Three.
JPMorgan: recommends underweighing in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
Parallel to its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congress vote on the amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim that both will enter into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, entails the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening the protection of investors, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and encouraging cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulations will enable financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFIs), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
Furthermore, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose in the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all operations they perform, to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
In his passing by the Congressional Economics Commission, several amendments were incorporated, among which it highlights that securitized debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given their high danger to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what has happened with the US high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can perform 30 years after the royal decree was adopted in 1977 that defines the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its products marketing and customer recruitment services to different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five tenths in November to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides a breakthrough in how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advance indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various methods of statistical modeling to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is only orientative, so it does not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be released on December 14.
IPC will continue at relatively high levels
Second Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the rise at 4.1 percent of the CPI in November was a "temporary figure", but at the same time he said the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation difference from the monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the Economy Minister said in a statement.
Virgin plans to raise $42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen by more than 50 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (16.8 billion euros) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to a Bank of England emergency credit.
At the time, it had record deposits of over <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has gradually dropped in two and a half months due to distrust of its customers and despite the guarantee of 100 percent of that money offered by the government and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenue from British banks deposited over the next three years to achieve the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion until reaching the target of 30 billion.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about €70 million) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin consortium offer, in which three other companies are involved, as his favorite to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has detained today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the police chief of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputies, and until then the governor of the municipality, and that according to research sources consulted by the Chain SER, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The officers continue to register the municipal units and the urban planning council and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER Chain reported yesterday, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore afforded, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of the investigation, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono agrees to lead the candidature of the PSOE for Toledo and chair the Congress if they win
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the PSOE list for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be president of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced in a press conference by the PSOE Organization Secretary, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief of the executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to chair Congress if the socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the upcoming general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to devote himself to fighting climate change in the university sphere.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has insisted on returning to the political avant-garde since leaving it two years ago.
He added that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over Congress, in an “act of transparency.”
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into “the house of respect and not of insult or scream.” and make it “more and more like citizens.”
"Sometimes it unfortunately seems that the only local in Madrid where you can't talk calmly and calmly is Congress, the president of the government was once interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had praise words for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good doing" and has not wanted to be already occupied his position so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotency".
Climate propaganda
Since the anti-climate movement is subjecting to ruthless persecution of both skeptics of its predictions and those prioritizing other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even intends to sign a “new contract with the planet.”
This approach forces him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the non-compliance, in which sectors it has occurred and why its government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, he demands to explain with the utmost clarity to the Spaniards what measures he is going to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be affected, what citizen habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been and will not be such explanations.
It is precisely because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the actual measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has hurried to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of all real consequences.
With shocking phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new offices.
With contracts with the planet, this lord is so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but embellishes the meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we travel on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the fan.
Arrested Mayor and Chief of the Local Police of Totana for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the City Council secretary and a hospitality entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation reported today.
The edil was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose units he is currently located alongside numerous agents, who have also visited the City Council of Urban Planning and the municipal management company of Industrial Floor and Housing.
These three arrests are added to the six performed last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalibration of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanizable so that the Galician company Nuaria could build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are imputed in the summary, which is instructed by Totana Court No. 1.
The first six detainees were sent to court today.
According to sources, the former Totana ruler and today the PP’s autonomous parliamentary member, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as well as the current girlfriend of the former ruler, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the Vigués lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was detained in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Immonuar, agency integrated into the aforementioned Group, through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven records, mostly in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonouar, dedicated to the promotion of real estate; Conycase, which manages the viguese parking lots of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

If you wish, let us let the Book of the Month rest, to see if in the meantime we can think of another ‘premiology’ and other competences.
I'm already perceiving something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.

Our Finnish correspondent makes this comment yesterday in Finland’s most important newspaper (by the way, at the head of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that Blackburn’s book was curiously criticized:
“The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped into public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Advisor in charge of the subject of philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Internet download crimes:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to a year.
Instead, if you steal in the store discs worth less than 400 euros, it is simply considered missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal in the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the penalty imposed on discharge (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than that of the discharge (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel has a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a sentence of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and authorless films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone's getting his hand, a very long hand.

My physician gives me one of his articles on rare research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less.'
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of the workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been performed using tomographic magnetic resonance scans at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition image group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if when both hit the same payout, the activation was moderate, but if one received double, the activation was higher.
I don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing the Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter-sweet taste, because the main responsible for the slaughter of Srebrenica – in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died – former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are on that list titled by the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach, “Carla’s List” (2006, not released in Spain), which, at the pace of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue fleeing criminals and pressure the governments involved to narrow the fence.
What insurance is good for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, is an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, license age, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear of what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which stipulates that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the license, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use to be given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the more likely you are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to be paid.
That is why both women over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower disaster rate due to their prudence.
Also, taking hands on the counts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the likelihood of having some kind of perchance.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we expose the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 have various drawbacks when contracting insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced driving experience and the age of the license.
Although the ideal place to be well insured is full-risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk franchise, so they get coverage of an all-risk insurance but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer would pay a portion of the claim amount.
"The part of the amount of the claim that the customer brings will be pre-established based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," said Luis Noguera, the top responsible in Spain for First Europa, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer is guaranteed protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A counsel.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be careful and avoid disasters as far as possible, as this will impact on the bonus, which can reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on such a base fee.
“Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses,” Noguera said.
After the age of 25, drivers have easier to contract insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, it is best to take a full risk with a franchise.
"Normally, young people cannot make use of the experience previously acquired when it comes to an accident, and even when it comes to driving," said the director in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once past the 'fear of the rookie'.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risks, as long as his economic situation allows him to do so, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest rate of sins, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with a franchise (which can be 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford to take on a larger amount of franchise," Luis Noguera said.
For retirees it is recommended to have an all-risk insurance with a franchise (which is 150 euros), or one to third parties extended when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us according to our personal situation.
Celtic is looking for a point worth the eighths in Milan
Milan and Celtic measure themselves in San Siro on Tuesday in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the 'Champions' lineup, as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to judge their qualifying.
The Italians add ten points and already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another one to make sure the Shakhtar, with six, and that he receives Benfica, who has four, does not ahead of him.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the end of the entire sixth day, as Milan has to play the Club World Cup in Japan, where it debuts on day 13 in semi-finals in search of a place for the final of the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw in Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better cross in eighths.
Gordon Strachan could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar doesn’t win, but can’t be trusted because at equality of nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanists will try to bitter the night to the Scots, who trust to get eighths for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the round.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who is only worth the triumph, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get in eighths and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the highest European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, with some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium that the group's meeting is "brillant".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to witness the concert that included a video in which the story of the group that made fury in the late 1990s was narrated.
The reencounter and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that includes their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five Spice Girls members went out on stage wearing bracelets given to them by Posh Spice’s husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the audience on the GM Place, even though Victoria’s nerves had banned him days earlier.
In the wake of the show's start, Victoria Beckham said the British star "has not seen our cloakroom at all, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the dissolution of the quintet two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have been fixed and we love each other very much."
But a lot of things have changed since the Spice Girl last performed together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4), and Los Angeles (December 5-7).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over gas prices between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia’s export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases gas prices, Russia will have to pay higher transit fees.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, monopolic gas owner, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine was to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge Ukraine more, as Ukraine has pledged to pay an extra 50% in 2008 for gas coming from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say Ukraine could pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
“The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] through Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly rose prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply of gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "should test foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a watchman said.
The recommendation of Auditor General Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of how much foreign staff it has.
However, his report noted other checks that are correctly carried out through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European Economic Area following the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi physician from Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep at the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged car bombings in the UK.
NHS expects to conduct pre-employment checks on applicants, to make sure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish health board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The general auditor’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with criminal checks in many countries outside of Britain.
“Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these checks, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff.”
Scottish BMA Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checks work at NHS Scotland but it is unclear what the added value of the recommendations made is,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the general auditor warned that the number may be higher, partly because boards have trouble identifying employees with indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely fulfilled.
This includes passport controls, work permits, and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing foreigners’ pre-employment policy and guidelines in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was very interested that this work would be carried out in the wake of the terrorist attack on Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates at film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division’s late vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the Best Film Award.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond’s protagonist, Daniel Craig, won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film – in black and white – featuring the soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was produced with just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, also won two awards—best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony – such as Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the Best Documentary Award.
The award for best actor was won by Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in London, in David Cronenberg's film Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The Fifty, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently films the sequel to Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named after Harris, Camelot star and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters and patrons of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal, and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it arrested 208 terrorist cell militants planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television from the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al Qaeda supporters have set up a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi interior minister, said 18 of the arrested belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned smuggling eight missiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in stopping Saudis travelling to Iraq to join as militants of al-Qaeda to fight the Allied forces and support the Muslim Shia government, which is considered heretic by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants — recruited by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government — had as targets residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
“This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work,” the interior minister’s spokesman told state television.
The arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 others accused of providing support and financial support to the militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may once have been an appropriate place for life, scientists declared yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion from solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and storms of lightning.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a picture of how Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford Department of Physics and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, states: “It is being clarified why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when two planets are so similar.
“Our new data make it possible to build a scenario where Venus began as Earth, possibly with a living environment millions of years ago.”
Police confiscate "enriched uranium"
A kilogram of radioactive material, which they declare is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still remains open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where common voters record video questions and send them for broadcast among candidates.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican party debate.
But the questions, and answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party ahead of next year’s elections.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas they liked: broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The toughest word exchanges of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been leading in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation as he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, agreed on the issue.
No one has the word to be nominated, but both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned on the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China’s toxic toys and other concerns overseas, helps Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned into uncomfortable when other topics emerged.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water immersion should be considered a torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations, first in the latest Iowa survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too clever to be a candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is growing in Iowa, coincidentally with Liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the game is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Labour pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges.
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
It does not seem that influences have been sold, nor are these exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor extramarital finger sucks.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour government party of over <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 (1.3 million) for nearly four years using fake names, and that the party has not denounced him.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided calling an election, stupidly insulting British intelligence declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has moved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poverty in judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative blur.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting the cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour Secretary General (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walked irrevocably toward the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it’s clear that the prime minister can’t improve things, that it doesn’t take him much time, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers expose themselves; the press is looking for bad news; and the government gets defensive and doesn’t focus.
On the one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself arguing that he is new.
Even though I wanted to renounce Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The issues of Northern Rock and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as Chancellor of the erary.
And even when it’s not directly involved in Blairish’s mess – or “partner cash,” the investigation of political party financing – voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr. Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has he been cheated directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not made by him.
The laws against anonymity for big political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham’s agreement, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, head of fundraiser who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing that suggests he knew about these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for violating the law, but he is diluted in decision making by a family matter, an investigative commission on the matter - led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of the police.
Furthermore, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head of the Commission on Public Life Standards, since he has not had one in six months, and he must also push for genuine reform of party financing.
This will require a harsh cooperative work by the Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the trade unions - bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he must deal with some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probeness and solid competition.
Sharks cards
Is the subprime mortgage crisis infecting the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that a few spinal fins swim emotionally around.
Now that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate credit card losses can reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of contagion are already seen.
There is an increase in both card fees and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or are more than 30 days delayed respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million charges in its U.S. consumer financing business, partly due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it’s too early for panic.
Delay and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
Deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. People Bankruptcy Act (2005) led to a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss on credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, delayed) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, which show how much of their debt consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed securities is quite firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25 percent higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exists: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are expiring.
But credit card issuers look more at the liquidity flow than active securities, so falling prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers’ credit capacity.
They can even work to get ahead of the issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the loan value; and as a result, the payment of the card’s debt rises on the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, by changing interest rates or altering credit balances.
That theoretically should reduce the risk of a rapid rebound of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief finance officer at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a credit shrinkage pushes America into recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harsher future.
We have to keep watching for those back fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility for fraud with former chief of Enron’s financial office, Andrew Fastow, were convicted on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became famous in Britain for two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, his case marks the loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Initially, charges against bankers were of having warned Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's fall.
The accusation against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - alleges they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron company, which was the craftsman of a myriad of Enron frauds, which helped his fall spiral in bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary’s interests at zero, but the three British knew it would rise.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest for $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million left in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers collected 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received nearly 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide millions of debt or make their failing businesses seem successful.
The collapse caused thousands of jobs to lose, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay, and former chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, were charged with imprisonment last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the wealthy Russians.
“It has capacity for up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
“But none asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of Gulfstream's cabin last Friday at the Millionaire Fair, a four-day orgy of consumption held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their display stands, hoping to attract new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany crafted yachts to diamond-inlaid car grills worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully looks at a bright orange Porsche at the neighboring stand to his own."
“It’s a beautiful car, but it’s nickel and boiler compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.”
Supplyed with fuel by the boom of oil, the Russian capital resembles Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to gather in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s biggest consumers and spenders.”
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their part of the cake.
Another place in Moscow, this week will be held a conference on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the wealthiest people.
In addition, second-grade wealthy include 103,000 Russian billionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russians were below the livelihood level.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – and that’s why we’re all here,” says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweler.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are flawlessly prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon costume, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit he wore as a red carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the kind of buyers who would be willing to stay for several hours in a warehouse that blends brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum pen cutters, Mövenpick ice cream, custom swimming pool tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of Dutch royal porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, sellers said wealthy Russians (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people — millionaires in cash, emissaries of millionaires or tourists — fill the hallways every day.
Some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, managing director of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000-dollar mattress sets each made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customises luxury cars, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grids for Rolls Royce Phantom for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with embedded rays of Swarovski colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” Karapetian says.
"He's going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusiveness, given the price wave of real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with $1 million fake banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their phones while resting on piles of money, or packing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” Karryev says.
Hooded Surgery Could Be Causing Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant window "A little healthier" and saw an ambulance climbed up White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance go up,” said Mr. Livingston, supervisor of the restaurant, that day Wednesday.
“That’s when I knew someone had died.”
Authorities heard that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, an assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at the home of 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities do not yet determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available until a few weeks, which will help solve the mysterious death that has grieved the upper ranks of Newark police.
Mrs. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, working and tenace," Mr. McCarthy says about Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She protected me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and who left two sons aged 14 and 11, and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for County Union Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died following unauthorized surgical procedure.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” Walsh said.
“It’s an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
It has been more than a week and authorities have said little about his investigation or about the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been interrogated by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door in Mrs. Castro's home, where a faded rose is located in the front of the house, and a Dalmatian laughs in the back.
A blue drum labeled as "vainillin ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was at the door of the garage, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang with hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this one or that one,’” she said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock exchange
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the federal reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which increased with the U.S. central bank vice president’s reassuring comments.
The stock exchanges loosened in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, declared that policymakers should be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to the ongoing tension in financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was “partially inverted by market improvement in late September and during October.”
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of further adjustments to the financial conditions for real estate and businesses, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a notice from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in an overall cost reduction to offset the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of these positions are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at closing to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at closing to 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s first-order companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit tension in markets was highlighted after a strong demand in a three-month funds auction by the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, tensioned the credit and rates of the three-month "Libor" loans among British banks, meant the highest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England takes trial of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none is less important in the face of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection who is on loan—with that particular title at least—is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and furthermore because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is beginning to fill out bids to become a national selector, and if not one part-time.
Anyone who doesn’t get the sixth bat will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport as well.
It is not easy to throw what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than for capacity.
Not only in cricket is choice difficult, it requires judgments that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a cricket player, unless they give him a chance to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to catch the captain's eye at the same time taking a "wicket" and a batter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the coaches is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example James Anderson, who surely plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The games of Shah or Bopara at Asgiriya Stadium can be only a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every race and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a major player, and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion in today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable early 88 debut test in Mumbai, 32 hundred first-class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent background against spin bowling.
But Shah did only ten races in his two rounds in May against West Indias at the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, seemingly taking from his "batting" some momentum that in Mumbai.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live in swords.
He hits himself for nothing on the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and presumably a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked at a distance, to tell him with excitement, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his plays that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which doesn’t mean that Shah doesn’t stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it’s he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who were left without cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight against the militants who led them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transportation.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that’s safe now.”
"They say Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he says, referring to the Shia militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to cease.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him on the phone to tell him that an Allied U.S. force helped pull Al Qaeda out of its bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenades attack after he urged citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my comrades.”
“That’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obedi, 62.
Many said they were attracted to the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops held armed groups of "worried citizens" working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many declared to have returned because of the denial of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shia prime minister, called on the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian crews of death.
“We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will bring back sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As across the country, Sardinians lack only one educational field.
“Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French,” that was the ironical bike about themselves from the smallest federal state for his fiftieth.
At the same time France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system that in a study by the Institute of German Economics (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied fifth place.
Thus, higher schools by tradition have good relations with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, from 15.6 per hundred.
However, the number of students coming from the Saar is higher than the average in higher schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
“In the Saarland, the system of professional education is used,” says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the Institute of German Economy (IW).
More than every five young people take their bachelor’s degree in the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Saarland is 7 percent higher than the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very broad.
The offer of double races, in relation to the population number, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has fallen by a third in recent years.
That was why the Saar Ministry of Education forced higher schools to advertise more for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we have made some reforms in general education schools,” says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government introduced comparative evidence across the country.
In order for the children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also mimics the other federal states.
The comparison with the upcoming studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of late-school students in school development decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
But, overall, the Saar did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the disgust of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although they could achieve good results in this field.
Although Sardinians are not French, the language of neighbors is a compulsory subject at the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Chávez changes the time.
Soon there will be another time zone in Venezuela that is different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets change the timetable in the South American country by delaying the clock half an hour.
Chávez is currently becoming a comedian in Spain.
As reported in the Official Bulletin of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will pass to less than four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States once imposed the obligation on the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the breaking of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the action with hostage taking.
The left-wing nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship either with the head of state or with the Colombian government until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained the president of Colombia.
“My dignity does not allow me to do so,” says Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where citizens of the oil country must decide in a referendum on Sunday.
This reform could greatly expand its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe when he withdrew Chavez’s mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla on the release of the hostages.
On Sunday, Chavez said criticizing that Uribe’s decision has offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Chávez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who was annoyed by the ongoing interruptions by the left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in real wages threatened the Germans.
According to a forecast, a decrease in real wage this year threatens German employees despite a strong conjunction.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation calculations, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
“The fault of this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the sliding of food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn, the Institute of Macroeconomics and Research of Economic Cycles, reported.
New unemployment insurance charges can also be charged to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% by moving from one year to the next is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office does not have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies from the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social Democratic Party.
Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food and oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, they are rising by 3%.
Venus: Earth's twin brother.
Despite its atmosphere not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most Earth-like, something that had not been raised so far. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls in the poles, the same that also appear in winter on Earth.
Three decades ago, researchers had been suspected that there could be lightning on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays shut down at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles tells the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, rays caused life on Earth: storms may have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus, it’s not like that: if there was life there ever, that would have to be in one of the earliest states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and on the surface temperatures reign 500°C, swinging in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Positively, Venus is a 'devil' twin of Earth, but it remains a twin," Russell said.
The main goal of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, just for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles in Nature, according to the researchers, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had supposed,” ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, researchers also discovered a cloud-formed vortex in the southern polar region that rotates faster.
This phenomenon reminds of wind flows in the high terrestrial atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet also called dawn star or evening star orbits around the Sun almost 225 days.
But their rotation period is slower: one day on Venus equals 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble Earth much, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed in the same conditions.
On both planets water had been clustered that on Earth remained in the oceans, but on Venus dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on ending the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social-Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the September rally.
Federal President Horst Koehler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and that’s why he demanded that the great coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told the newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in the midst of foreign policy, the Federal President underlines, defending Merkel for the reproach she received in carrying out a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of One China’s policy.
China also knows that,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust with the reception of the Dalai Lama and as a result was attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the German finance minister, but also, according to news sources from the magazine Spiegel, froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the chief of government of China, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians to receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in his official position.
Dalai Lama’s actions and words demonstrated that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schäuble warns that riots like those in France will occur.
Battles with police on the streets, shootings, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not move onto the streets.
They made barricades, the vandals shot with rifles at the police: after serious riots starring young people in France, the Federal Minister of Home Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We must also bear in mind that our country’s social problems don’t take the violent form.”
“We have to take that seriously,” he said in the newspaper Neue Presse, published in Hanover.
Not all young people unfold in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, the federal state and the municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the Integration Summit to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits.”
It’s too early to take for granted the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schäuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people starred in serious street riots with police north of Paris last night.
In Tolouse, cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government to integrate.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns of an imitation effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
It is necessary to ensure that there are more vocational training posts.
Kolat emphasizes: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", greater than the French country.
In addition, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, “But in spite of everything, we have to be careful.”
It is necessary to "give young people the opportunity to get a job or vocational training faster".
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen participated in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
Responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as garbage and burnt cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been dealing with security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Home Affairs, announced that police will take rigorous action until necessary.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Tolouse.
The riot began in a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecutor’s office, the deaths of young people were not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor demonstrates that the coalition has reached its last point in content and that nothing else should be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the Lower House, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As to the reproach made to her for repeatedly devoting herself to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he does not want to understand what interests critics.
In the lower house it was very clearly expressed to all that this reproach was appropriate.
It was not possible to feel a little interest or any kind of feeling about the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that flees in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything concrete.
An example: climate change prevention: she praised herself very much for the decisions made in Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
Overall, this way of praising itself – for two years the head of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
It is in terms of expressions so that an impulse can be reached by people.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, inner problems are appearances of little value.
Children’s poverty and worries about low-wage workers?
The only thing he devotes himself to is to talk about this subject using subordinate sentences.
It’s amazing how many times you’re wrong talking about the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It starts to stumble "as if it were in an unknown territory", when it was about more specific information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a clash in a heated debate of YouTube Republican presidential pre-candidates and now should fear only one candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates are noticed from the outset.
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani of turning New York City into “a refuge for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attack: as so far the Republican group has no clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the CNN debate, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by Internet users that were uploaded to Youtube, also have a lot of content.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” that was the reproach of John McCain to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one in the meeting that insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to acknowledge as torture "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown, simulate his death.
Public reactions in the hall in St. Petersburg, Florida show that meanwhile the most important topics of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or debates about torture.
The public always applauded very loudly when praising conservative securities and denying the rise in taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“At that time I was wrong,” explains Romney, who is depressed and asks for forgiveness to the people and television audience for being an abortion advocate in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf rules without uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military government in Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pakistan’s president Pervez Musharraf took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday he transferred his term as army chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the US.
Eight years after he took power with an incruented military coup, the former general ruled the state for the first time as a civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other demand is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state prosecutor general, after the oath Musharraf will soon annul the state of emergency and will fulfill the second condition of the West.
Since it was proclaimed a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there were many Musharraf advocates. Last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continues its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release he made a copy of "Live 1974" that was written in the band's best time.
Already at that time they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen to an official meal caused the feeling.
Each of them has its box, its wires and especially its buttons in front of them.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is Michael Rother, 57, who has his laptop and guitar.
To the right, looking from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems that this doesn't bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the band Harmonia returned to make music.
What has to be rebelled here is the following: the questions accurately have shown that the name of the band resonated in people’s minds, but it wasn’t so special that after 32 years the audience missed her so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their live legend of the seventies?
Especially because the Krautrock misconception was always more valued in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded an "Echo" music award to members of the Can 2003 Cologne band for their work of life, in the hall they could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths with amazement.
Later Michael Rother spent his time on stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time did not achieve a great effect on the audience, however, it obtained it later thanks to the others.
Already some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Later, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and later worked as a guitarist at the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that was at the time too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was a life of an artist full of surprises.
They say, one day an Ottenstein's Harmonia chanting association banner appeared in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about knowing yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording, almost 50 people participated.
Then Rother expressed his desire to drive Harmony and do trials from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is contrary to customs.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up engaging in esoteric themes and assured its existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since then has been more successful than Harmony had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that's what we have to thank Groenemeyer.
Her music company Grienland set itself the goal of cultivating this German own contribution to preserve it as living music.
Like Roedelius's work, the band Neu! was once again discovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of Cultures of the World in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all of Krautrock’s influences on the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are pictures where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the legend’s development is shown in the black and white photo projections, where wired instruments are seen.
At the bottom there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and the battery so that they can produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects devices they had built with their own hands.
Today, electronic music is the way it had to be.
Three people who deepen in the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere it is toughed, whispered and in a good time of emphasis it is sung "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always an English term.
It was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Anyone here who shouts "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia retains calm.
The scene reflects very well on what is already obvious.
Where does the music begin and end?
That can break your nerves or give you quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are once again devoted to the war in the Balkans.
But the two didn’t have much conviction.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot on actions and shootings or both movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" cannot help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountains, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the prettiest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and little-important roles in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument for perhaps watching the movie "The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why nowadays the titles of the movies have to be so long and nonsense?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for sight: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life have passed, that as a monument of the ruin of his decline retained most of his charm so far.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turns out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads her to fall in love with her.
The sense of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" one can investigate, because there actually never was a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another scriptwriter (Richard Shepard in two charges), the story about the American reporters in the war going to detect a war criminal Serbian named "fox", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now."
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to do something that the army cannot do and every time it turns out to be a journey of madness.
One reason for "The Hunting Party"'s failure is when we are first introduced to Simon Hunt, whom they don't let him be simply a cynic with heart.
No, the script also foresees a love adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will be killed later.
Then “The Hunting Party” is far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with impressive speed achieve what NATO, the CIA and all the headhunters of the world couldn’t achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians for fair revenge.
It’s so bad, that they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against kinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is actually a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and stresses that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so that a very famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the big wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not just the genre of war films in the Balkans.
He recently posted in a newspaper that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiasco.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always a rule is worthwhile: when a star gets through a region of crisis or through the minefields, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blooding Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio appears.
Possibly all of these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to pass at least decades until Hollywood rolls a good film about the Holocaust by taking the film "The Schindler List" as an example.
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the Vietnam war works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not unanimously celebrated as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, and that’s why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because the scriptwriters don’t have the slightest repair (which is necessary to be able to) in telling good stories.
"Being or Not Being" or "The Great Dictator" were ultimately so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime was actually.
Perhaps you shouldn’t be a good person to shoot a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look at an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied, "That's just because some things never change."
Great cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly killed and in Yugoslavia war will always reign.
Von Beust is receiving negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms from politics and economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, general director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that resignation was "not good for the economic location".
In the last time no other project in the big city fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal, we could not maintain the political, sporting momentum at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "referring to another time."
On Wednesday Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statements that Hamburg’s ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, it is decided by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," von Beust says at the WELT ONLINE.
It referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich’s application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which we until now thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view, we will not have any opportunity.”
Despite everything, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
“It’s too early to let the opportunity be taken away, if plans are ruined right now,” HSB director Günter Ploß said Wednesday.
A waiver of the request is contradictory to the statement made by the head of the Senate at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German Public Federation of Sport of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg’s 2015 university application not as a “substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Higher Schools Sports Federation appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The Fraction of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate for not taking so valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
“For many years the Senate was delaying with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because it was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses,” said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded integrated Olympia planning for the little Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU underlined the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg’s application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn’t think of Andy Warhol.
Or do you?
Currently, the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Brightness Box on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's "Bright-Box" market of 1968, the Moderna Museet of Stockholm also conducted internal research and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Bright-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén almost presented to the Modern Museet's.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Bright-Boxes" in New York, painting the wooden boxes in red, blue and white, with the same sample that they had soap powder boxes "Bright".
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Moderna Museet museum hundreds of Bright-carton boxes were exhibited. These were not made by Warhol (on account of expenses), but were brought directly from the "Bright" carton factory.
They were not works of art, but exemplars (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce wooden boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of that time now talk about nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Brightness Boxes" of "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were bought at auctions for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous museum director Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed nearly one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Moderna Museet museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of 1990 shows that the paint was applied with a roller without directly printing the tight silver. In addition, it is not oil painting, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Bright-Boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet museum, adding that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York City does not come to any conclusion, the Moderna Museet museum will classify these six boxes as copies.
Already in July the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these "serious allegations" that they are soap powder boxes.
But from that moment everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had entrenched themselves in a Manila hotel have surrendered and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accuses the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers had been entangled in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended up in a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, to suddenly be able to deposit with some 30 supporters.
Obviously, the military policemen who had to watch him had passed into his ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood near the Hotel Noble.
The president called for an urgent Security Cabinet session.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security counselor, condemned the behaviour of the soldiers.
“People are tired,” said Trillanes.
“We call people to come to our ranks.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers troop, said the other military troops would soon want to continue the march.
Large government critics called for a major demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months his government has been accused of corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention by the riot that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts in the Philippines against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the telecom company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was a lot of speculation about the company’s absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial share at Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it intends to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
Wednesday they made assumptions about the entry into the business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 hundreds to 15.1 hundreds.
In the financial market that means that the financial institution holds the holding bonds for a third party partner.
United Internet already the day before made the telecommunications company Drillisch participate with nearly 10 per hundred.
Drillisch in the capital expansion measure placed 17.4 million of new shares worth €106.4 million.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares of them for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperations.
“We strengthen our collaboration,” said the spokesman for United Internet.
The two companies founded a joint MSP company, to acquire the competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at the beginning, the two companies want to be happy with the 10 percent stake in Freenet and do not make use of their right, i.e., make 18.49 participate by hundreds of Freenet.
That meant that both companies retained all options, especially participation in the Freenet shareholding company.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Until now the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch would get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of Vatas investment company was already agreed in August.
