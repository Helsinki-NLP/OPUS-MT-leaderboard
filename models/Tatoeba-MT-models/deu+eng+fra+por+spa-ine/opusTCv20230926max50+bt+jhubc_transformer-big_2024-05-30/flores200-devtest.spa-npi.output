Gold may adopt all sorts of forms and be rolled into small figures.
Non only it can be hammered and rolled into foils, but it is also possible to stretch it to achieve a very thin wire that can be twisted and pleated.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It is such a thinness that can be achieved that it used to dekorate illustrations handmade in books called "Illuminated Handwritten".
This is called pH of a chemical substance. You can create a pH indicator using Red Kohl juice.
La coloration du jus de couvre sera modifiée en fonction de la acidité ou de la base (alkaline) est la substance chimique.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the analyzed chemical determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron. So, a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping a proton of its electron.
Agite both dry powders together and, after doing so, with hands hygienized and humid, express them to form a ball.
A reaction between humidity in your hands and your outer layers will occur, which will feel strange to touch and will form a kind of shell.
Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, had toilets with discharge in almost every house, which were connected to a sofisticated drainage system.
In some homes of the minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, we found traces of sewage systems.

Below, there are more moderate size felines that feed on medium prey, from rabbits to antilopes and jerseys.
Finally, there are many small cats (including independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much more quantities, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of your success is the concept of niche: every felin has a particular function, which prevents you from competing with others.
Lions are the cats that most socialize and their life goes within large groups called herds.
2Onze hrádae consist of one to three adult males of the same family group, united with up to thirty females and their puppies.
Normally, females are intimately related to each other, which makes them a great family of sisters and daughters.
Lions' herds have the same behavior as those of wolves or dogs, with whom they have a surprising similarity (in contrast to other big cats) both in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal for their prey.

Ocelots enjoys feeding small creatures. Once they can, they will hunt apes, snakes, rodents and birds. Practically all their prey will be much smaller size than yours.
Scientists believe that ocelotes tracks and find animals to eat (prey) through olfactory, stinking the soil where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, moreover, they move very silently. The ocelots hunt their prey mimicing with their surroundings and then swing over them.
(b)When a small group of living beings (a small population) departs from the main group from which they provengono (e.g., if they move to a mountain chain or to a river, or if they move to a new island so that they can't easily go back) they will often be found in a different environment than they were used to.
El nuevo entorno tiene diferentes recursos y competidores y, por lo tanto, una nueva población necesitará características o adaptaciones diferentes de las que tenía antes para ser un fuerte competidor.
No changes have occurred in the original population, which still need the same adaptations as in the past.
Com o passar do tempo, a medida que la incipiente población se adapta al nuevo ambiente, comienza a ser cada vez menos similar a la otra población.
Enfin, après mille ou même millions d'années, les deux populations seront tellement distinctes qu'il ne sera possible de les classifier comme d'une même sorte.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an indispensable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plantas generar el oxygen que los hombres respiran y absorben el carbon dioxido que ellos exhalan (que expiran).
Nourishment from plants is generated from solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. Plus, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without them, animals wouldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of his time, so he had no fear of anything but others of his own species.

For example, the most commonly used format of fixed image photography globally is that of 35 mm, which was the size of film most widely used towards the end of the era of analog films.
Today it is still producing, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relation was moved to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, since its measurements are 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
For this reason, it is said that the dimensional ratio of this format (dividing by 12 for calculating the ratio of integer numbers simplest) equivale to 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbigracy, the APS format group) are equal or very similar to this aspect ratio.
The Rule of the Thirds, which has been object of constant mockery and often ridiculized, is a simple pattern that generates dynamism while allowing to give a certain order to the images.

To understand the Templars it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the instauration of the order.
The European historical period in which these events are situated is commonly known as High Middle Age, between the XI, XII and XIII century (i.e., between 1000 and 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the early Middle Ages and followed by the late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that comprises, pragmatically, a wide range of ideas, from the technological impuls or imperative to a stringent sense that there is a underlying logic that drives the fate of humanity and that is related to the laws of science and how they are plasmated in the technology.
Quasi todas las interpretaciones del determinismo tecnológico tienen en común dos ideas generales: que el desarrollo tecnológico en sí mismo se despliega por un camino independiente de cualquier influencia cultural o política y que, al mismo tiempo, la tecnología tiene “efectos” en las sociedades que son inherentes y no socialmente condicionadas.
Para dar un ejemplo, uno podría argumentar que la existencia de los autos necesariamente deriva en el desarrollo de las carreteras.

The element of cultural determinism was very present in romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
En el contexto del Romanticismo, la geografia formó las personas y, con el tiempo, se desarrollaron costumbres y culturas relacionadas con esa geografia que, siendo en harmonia con la localización de esa sociedad, eran preferibles a leyes que se impusieron arbitrariamente.
Just as Paris is known as the city of fashion today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
His reputation for being epicenter of luxury began about 400 a.C. and extended until about 1100 a.C.
During the 12th century their status decayed, especially because, when they returned, the crusaders brought gifts, such as silk and spices, which were given more value than the goods offered on the bizantine markets.
Title of "mode capital" was transfered, from then, from Constantinople to Paris.
The cusp of the gothic style occurred in the period between X-XI and XIV century.
Initially, the way of dressing received great influence from byzantine culture in the East.
Doch, owing to the slowness of communication channels, western styles could take a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
In the late of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that era was that, product of the Crusade, people began to use buttons to stick their garment.

Historically, much of the ac principal activity of farmers was agricultura de subsistence, which continues to be practiced in many developing countries.
Subculturas conjuguen individuos con ideas similares y sentimientos de marginalización por los estándares sociales y les brinda la oportunidad de generar un sentido de identidad.
SUBCULTURES: Age, etnicity, class, location or gender of their members.
Traits that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, esthetic, sexual, geographical or be related to religion or politics, or a mix of factors.
Es frecuente que los miembros de una subcultura exhiban traces de su pertenencia a esta, recurriendo al uso distintivo y simbolico del estilo del estilo, como moda, gestos y el jargo.
Uno de los mecanismos más comunemente utilizados para graficar la importancia de socializar es analizar los pocos y lamentables casos de niños que, por negligencia, desgracia o intencionado abuso, no fueron socializados por adultos durante su crecimiento.
In some cases, the abandon of a child is due to the refusation of the parents to the severe mental or physical disability of the child. In some cases, the abandon of a child is due to the refusation of the parents to the severe mentale or physical disability of the child.
(a) Wild children may have suffered traumatic situations or serious child abuse before being abandoned or from escape.
Se dice que otros fueron criados por animales y que algunos han vivido por sí mismos en la naturaleza.
“When the wild child is only grown by animals other than humans, it presents behaviors (within their physical possibilities) almost in a whole equal to those of the specific animal that took care of it, as well as their fear or indifference to people.
Although project-based learning should facilitate this process and make it more interesting, the scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; it is, rather, a assistance that provides support to those through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
The scaffolding can be presented both in real and virtual format; to say otherwise, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but it is also the small animated motivation wallpapers of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are incorporated into software and their function is to question, stimulate or explain procedures that may have resulted complex for student alone.

No child should ever have to grow up in an environment in which there is no affection, care and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family welfare system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, amorous tutors, sustained education and reliable medical care.
Objective of Family Accommodation is to satisfy all the needs that were not satisfyed in the home from which they were collected previously.
Internet unites y mixes componentes propias de la comunicación massiva y entre personas.
The different traits presented by the Internet open the way to new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are identified as significant incentives for the use of Internet (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), “personal participation” and “durable relations” were also identified as new motivational factors.

En sabana, no es fácil para un primate, cuyo sistema digestivo es igual a la humana, satisfacer sus necesidades de aminoacidas con los recursos vegetales de que dispone.
Even so, man no doing so brings serious problems: deceleration of growth, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
Proteins presents in leafs and leguminoses would have been the source of vegetal resources that is more easily accessible, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except that they are cooked.
In contraste, foods derived from animals (murts, termites, eggs) are easy to digest, while providing a great number of proteins containing the entirety of essential amino acids.
Ultimately, we shouldn’t be surprised if our own predecessors resolve their “protein problems” like the chimpanzees of savanna today.
Interruption of sleep (interruption of sleep) consists in waking up intentionally during normal periode of sleep and sleeping after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved with a more or less smooth alarm clock that brings you back to a conscious state, although without waking you completely.

Other options that are based on biologic rhythm are drinking much fluid (especially water or tea, known diuretic) before bedtime, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace enjoyed by a person is oppositely related to the amount of tension that is in his body and his spirit.
Jo lower the tension is, the more positive is the force of life with which we count. Every one of us has the potential to find absolute peace and joy.
All we can reach the lighting. The only thing that hinders the way is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they extended through the path of Mahayana love and numerous indian yoga techniques.
Generally speaking, laïcism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that covers everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini Energy (Ilumination) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras, or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through visualization of different deities, you can debarrade the energy channels, activate the chakras and develop the lighting consciousness.
Cooperation between URSS and USA was the result of confrontation with a common enemy, Germany, during the Second World War. Behind the war, system shocks, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were now allied were enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and would be really combated, through substitute militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other sites.
Da 17 September 1939 Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to give the retirement and reorganizing in the extension of the Romanian Bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans fallen into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800 000 combattants of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and formed the belarussian and ukrainian fronts after invading the regions of East Polen, in violation of the Riga Treaty of Peace, the Soviet-Polish pact of Non-Agression and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Use of ships to transport goods is a much more efficient way to transport large number of people and goods through oceans.

In the same time, the German Navy, employing primarily submersibles, attempted to annuller this circulation.
If the Allied had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Great Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
Seems, goats were domesticated, for the first time, about 10.000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains, Iran.
In order to get easily their milk, hair, flesh and leather, the ancient peoples and tribes began to stay with them.
in general, the goats of the house were generally congregated in herds that wandering in the hills or other pastoral areas, often cared by shepherds of goats that used to be children or adolescents, similar to the most popular shepherd. These methods of pastoring are still still used in the present.
In England, the railway tracks had already been installed in the 16th century.
```Et ``aununque railways of carrias,```aunque railways of carrias,``aunque railways of carrias,``aunque were made of simple simple paralelele wooden boards,``aunque railways of carrias were made of simple paralelelele wooden boards,`````````a, .
Incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place occurred quite early. However, gradually, they were realizing that the rails would be more efficient if they were coated with iron on their top.
This became a usual practice, though the iron caused a greater wear on the wheels of the wagons, made ofwood.
Eventually, wheels were substituted with others made of iron and, in 1767, began to be used rails of solid iron.
The first form of transport that was known was walking. The human started to do it in a vertical position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means man upright).

We can start to lead a more planet-friendly life, be part of environmental movements, or we can even become activists and fight to reduce, to some extent, future suffering.
It's, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment. But if you don't look for only a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to deactivate them.
De facto, it is evident that the world has under the great changes, product of the technological and scientific progress of the human humanity, and the problems have intensified as a cause of the overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of the people.
After being approved by Congress on 4 July, a draft handwritten and signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap printer, a few streets away.
A la nuit se produjeron entre 150 y 200 exemplares, las cuales actualmente se conocen como las «Dunlap Copies».
John Nixon first read the document and did it in the courtyard of the Independence Hall, 8 July.
A copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who ordered to be read to his army in New York on 9 July. 10 August another copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to exist, are the oldest conserved copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
Many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still living today. They're the birds.
Many people don’t imagine them as dinosauruses, because they have plums and can fly.
Echter, there are many characteristics in birds that still resemble them to dinosauruses.

Inner poisoning may not be evidenced immediately. Your symptoms, such as, for example, vomiting, are too common to be able to make an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be finding with a open flacon of medicines or toxic chemicals cleansing products.
Read the label for specific information about first aid relevant for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term parasitic insect in a formal sense to refer to this group of artropodes.
The word comes from their old relationship with chinches, species developed very much to parasite humans.
Assassin’s chinches and bed chinches are nidical; they are adapted to abite the nid or home of their host.
De facto, cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) reported in the USA are around 400 000, making it the most common neurological disease among young adults and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, the link of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerve, is the object of attack of multiple sclerosis.
Studies indicated that women are double more likely than men to have MS.

The fundamental objective of science is to decipher how the world functions through scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for the majority of scientific research.
This is not, however, an experimentation, is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses, posing questions and observations that guide the scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed in classical works; especially in the latin version of the Bible text.
Aristoteles's thoughts, especially the questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the dominion of the greek language was decaying, West distancated from its greek roots both philosophical and scientific.
Frequently, many rhythms present in physiological processes and behavior depend decisively of internal cycles and their production through biologic clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only about reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bakteries, fungi, plants and animals.
Biologic watches oscillate self-sustainedly and have a free cycle operating period, even if there are no external stimuli.

Traffic Flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is no easy task to study the flow of traffic, since it is not possible to make exact predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency in drivers to maintain a relatively consistent behavior, which allows traffic flows to have logical consistency and can be object of approximate mathematical representation.
In order to graph more clearly circulation flow, relations between the three most important elements were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
Tale relations facilitate both planning and design as well as operation of road devices.
The first species to fly off were the insects. This helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and partner more effectively.
La mayoría de los insectos tienen el ventajo de poder doblar sus cristales hacia atrás, adhiriendolos a las partes del cuerpo.
This gives them a larger range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Anisopters and ephemeropters are the only insects that are incapable of giving their wings.

Aristoteles, filosof, describes theory that everything is composed by a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
"That had greater similarity with the states of matter (with identical order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only that, at the same time, had the theory that they were transformed in new substances that form forming the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered elements such as calcium and potassium. From now, there are also metals of the kind of gold and silver.

Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. On one side of the spectrum, is the attempt to continue to be "one of the boys" (or girls).
Managers of this category have difficulty to make decisions that are bad for employees, impose disciplinary measures, carry out performance assessments, allocate responsibilities and require accountability to staff.
On the other end of the spectrum, you mutate into a person unrecognizable who thinks it necessary to modify everything that the group has been doing so far and doing it at its own way.
In the end, the ultimate responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This way of behaviour often ends by distancing leaders from other members of the team.
