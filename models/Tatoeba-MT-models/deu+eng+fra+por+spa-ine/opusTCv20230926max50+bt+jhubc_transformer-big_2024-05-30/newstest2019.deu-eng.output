"Beautiful Munich" 2018!
In the afternoon a surprise awaits our candidates again: they will deny the romantic candlelight shooting in front of MY SOLARIS not alone, but alongside Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirting, cocktailing, seducing - no easy tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "beautiful Munich candidates" deliver Tuan during the shooting with the people photographer and defy wind, splash and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for a return of Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that of course depends on getting into a conversation once, talking to him also about why he seems to have felt one or the other as it is stated in his statement," Grindel said in the soccer podcast "Phrasenmäher" to Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the months of debate with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about Özil’s photos, he regrets the resignation of 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed to some extent that this would be the case,” Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July, also justifying that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from football in such a way that if you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I find it a shame that this conversation has not happened so far.
Linz: Garden hut burned in Schrebergartensiedlung
At 14.13 a.m., the professional firefighter Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, the danger was in delay.
The occupational firefighter started and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically entirely and fire debris was cleared to the extent necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had infected a battery to shop at lunchtime.
This may be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the highest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be determined - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many collectors in his garden hut.
Angry Mother Resists: Lindsay Lohan Attacks Refugee Family on Open Street
What did Lindsay Lohan just drive to this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to take the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has live streamed herself as she apparently wants to take away the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the U.S. portal TMZ, publishing a partial part of the stream.
Here you see "Kissed Fortunately" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan comes out of a car and goes to a perhaps homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family almost escapes from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It accuses adults of child trafficking.
For all of this, she does not provide evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan hears in the video as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently, she tries to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses an earstick.
With tears, the actress claims how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What led Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is intended to approach asteroid Ryugu so closely that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The landing "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Abroad Ticker: Number of deaths on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe 7.5-size earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people are killed.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet penetrated into the devastated areas and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla Chief Supervisory Officer
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in stock markets in early August as he announced a withdrawal from the electric car manufacturer.
The U.S. exchange supervisory sued him for fraud, but now the two have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and Tesla’s CEO withdraws from the supervisory board, but he can remain chairman of the board.
Congress of the British Conservatives
Sharply guarded - the Tories Party Congress
Birmingham is becoming the stage of a power struggle.
The congress is about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these duplicates of names for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia will be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this Sunday - whether it is well?
Protests in Brazil against Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") - meant Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands went on the streets in several cities to protest the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” is an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers’ Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" upgrade takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force still exists,” Development Director Peter Mertens told Automobile Week.
Audi Chief Executive Officer Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
“All engine/gearbox combinations are expected to be tested in the first quarter of 2018,” he said.
Mertens said: “In early July, we reached an important stage goal in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the carmaker had made "grave organizational changes" to ensure that such a scandal never happens again.
VW’s supervisory board delayed a decision on Friday on Stadler’s future and plans to continue discussion on Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi Chief of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false emissions values after the exhaust frauds have been announced.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Bram Schot, Chief Sales Officer, currently manages the company as Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the switch to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, Schot said.
Basically, he sees a decline in demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment in itself is difficult,” he said.
Schot is focusing on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel aims for re-election - lame to join DFB
Mainz (dpa) - Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup out and the Özil affair next year, Reinhard Grindel wants to re-candidate for the office as DFB president.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest early Sunday morning at the ZDF's "Actual Sports Studio".
You have to try to re-election again and again, I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it "strand" if he did not "lust to work on the future project" after the award for the 2024 European Football Championship.
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016, he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will take place on the DFB Federal Day on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM Chief Organizer Philipp Lahm is expected to participate in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agree that he will continue to be advised in this role in the Bureau and then, of course, is warmly invited to provide his experience with sports issues," Grindel said.
He did not want to participate in speculation as to whether the lame could become his successor as DFB chief.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future he should become a national player without a migratory background of integration ambassador to the DFB.
Currently this office is held by the Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
“If one without a migration background clearly influences society and football and says, ‘the issue is important, we have to take care of it’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground where integration needs to work,” Grindel said.
Correct weight loss with semi-smart scale
I have had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat share.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is more for the wurst.
He doesn't say anything about whether I replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening success for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga.
The deputy champion won against Science City Jena easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
National player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators during his compulsory debut.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won in the compulsory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best thrower among the guests with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni reached 14 counters.
Last year’s playoff half-finalist MHP Giant Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the top shooter with 24 points in the team of coach John Patrick.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg began the new season with a clear success.
In the Löwen Braunschweig basketball there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings outperformed the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweiger, in which NBA star Dennis Schröder has been majority owner since the start of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the basketballs quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an urged the German government to deliver supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the city of Cologne was partially blocked.
Several thousand police officers were in operation, including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is criticized because it is considered an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, Buffs and Scary Seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B advocated a joint concert at New York Central Park for more commitment to fighting poverty and disease.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night before about 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with frans and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organizations also showed themselves on stage during the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a frightening second when many spectators thought the sound of a falling metal barrier was shot, feared and tried to flee.
Soon there was panic, people were running into trouble.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
The New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people off the stage.
“Nobody is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available for free on the Internet as every year.
Anyone who wanted to win one had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause from the audience - Buhrufe, on the other hand, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He and his Democratic colleague Chris Coons were on stage for greater equality between men and women.
But on Friday, Flake pronounced himself in the U.S. Senate’s judiciary committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as judge at the Supreme Court, thus throwing many women in the head.
At least three women accused Kavanaugh of abuse, including the attempted rape, which Kavanaugh rejected.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the accusations after two women who, according to his own claims, had experienced sexual assault on their way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
“You can also meet me in an elevator at any time,” Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends expulsion of journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an.
At the chancellor’s office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had dressed a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription “Freedom for Journalists” and went into the first row.
The t-shirt, it wasn’t the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption to the course of the press conference.
The journalist’s action has created a heavy unrest, which is not acceptable.
That's why he prompted protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellery.
This applies completely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in forbidden parties or the Fethullah-Gulen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatened with decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also unsure from the Turkish authorities: Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested only in early September.
Most recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused disturbance.
Although they were free and were able to return to Germany, there are still trials against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz fully drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and beautiful his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that’s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talkshow "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for moistly happy conversations at the counter of the Hamburg Harfenkneipe "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller and her guest will try some beer, some wine or even more high-percent drinks to relax the mood and tongues.
Many celebrities also drink courage for the mandatory singing entries.
Another episode of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: Actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Happy Day".
Munich didn’t get the trip to the high north at all.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, his eyes only two small slots left.
The bed selfie shows a fully exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he’s not sick, he has only a powerful cat.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not very seriously - findings that he has now gained: "Rule one: NEVER go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black pig.
And spray.
And the round egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half three, also let go.
Alcohol consumption is truly written on the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips on how to fight backwards.
They ranged from instant broth, fish breads or - probably most purposeful - headache pills.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive cinema star.
How Ina Müller has survived the night drinking is not known yet.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and dirt
The entry into the 36-kilometre-long bike trail in the Red Cap Land in Treysa is difficult to find and rubbish.
Recipes are being sought against the overwhelming vandalism, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shearing, cigarette tips, garbage and rubbish, demolished garbage bins and now dismantled signs - this is how the start with a seat group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presenting itself for a long time.
A more than infamous sight for the Bahnbikeweg in Red Hatland.
The topic employs members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the cycling officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed by the cycling advisory council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the positioning of the seat group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Desertenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he also brought the topic to the local council.
Not only is the garbage driving around cyclists and local residents - the seating group is a regular meeting place for celebration on weekends.
This is not only often done loudly, but also destroyed in the layouts: posts are ripped out of the ground, garbage bins are demolished, signs are knocked over, seat furniture is lubricated.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
You are upset that the cycling site in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking.
"Along the entire cycle path, the Haaße hill is clearly the focus here," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also concerned with the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which is opening today.
“If she suffers the same fate, it will be very expensive.”
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe this sets the threshold significantly higher for breaching common goods.
This would mean that a police force would pass by soon.
Basically, Deserthagen wants a development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
The frequency of the bike path so far can be very satisfied.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high quality compared to others in Germany," say the ADFC members.
Susanne Klippert, an ADFC member, appreciates the situation in the Asheröder Road in Treysa as an extremely critical hazard point.
There is no turning track on the Haaße hills.
With high traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between both-sided traffic flows,” she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the Cultural Railway Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and collaborative.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Big and Small, Young and Experienced Musicians".
A contest "with eye blinks in the sympathetic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family co-op with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Cultural Railway Station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-standing albathean living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colours", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the Zummer L
This contest, according to District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a novelty.
We haven’t seen this in other districts yet.
What did the writers relate to?
In the places, the Hiltruper Lake and the Market Allee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig cut the avenue in his crap-like song to "Kön von Hiltrup".
The Cultural Railway Station was also acknowledged.
It was always about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke revived the short pauses with short interviews with the artists or clues about their creation.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke was able to report that he recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest on the program.
And Alvin Jasic, meanwhile, has posted everything on YouTube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from Hiltruper Gastronomie.
However, there was something special for the jury’s favourites – so that others could also hear their songs.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmlich with his Hiltrup-Schlager, which impressed Franke especially with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very nice appearance" with ten children and two guitar and cajon educators, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the kids appeared again to the final - and sounded "rightly good" even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, engagingness of the melody and recognition worth.
The jury included Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Business Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year-old existence.
She regarded the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural railway station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
For each side, there is a screen with four cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red slide - until you put them in.
Thus, it is guaranteed that the opposite side can not read anything even by mistake.
On the maps, for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
Three cubes.
4th Fest."
These are the terms that need to be encrypted from now on.
It is not to guess the terms, but the codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might say "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" you should guess not the terms behind the secret film, but its encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "cube", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opponent team as far as possible does not; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads out loud: "throwing" for the cubes, "lots" as opposed to fest; here, of course, something like "party" would also be possible and "prague" because he has watched out at school and knows the window crash there.
This is round for round, team for team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side - but this can match better with every hint that the encryptor gives there.
The rewriting should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you will make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about "Decrypto" is the rulebook.
Players will probably have to study it quite long and in-depth until they can finally play.
The explanation video at decrypto.info on the net makes it easier.
But whoever started will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this unseen game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as conclusive as the predecessor and genre prime "codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is just about rates and not about victory points, can also easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harass guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspection twice as much in the night of Saturday to Sunday.
At first he greeted Hitler in the Upper City of a passing police force, later he also spotted himself in a pub in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholic, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspection in the prison cell.
In a sober state, he must also be held criminally liable for the use of unconstitutional marks of organizations.
Pressig was home to the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig has been the hub in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers hit buffers, you hear it in all the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't upset anyone.
Then the brakes knocked and the wagons scratched.
It was pure railroad.
Statements that are symbolic for Dinkel's homeland Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steilrampen mountain route to the north, which after an ascent of about 220 meters of altitude has its peak in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, early train and shu blocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway operations workshop with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship workshop, conducting and railway mastery.
"Heart piece was the hub, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich of Hirschaid, a railway historian and professional railroader for 47 years.
The Railway Operations Plant (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, also operated locomotives for the secondary routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staffing stock of 160 men; 13 steam and eight ellocks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and schublocks.
From 1977, they were only used on freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10,000 weighs were placed each month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were terminated, the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that we did not consider a better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport."
Even on Pentecost in 1989, the railway directorate of Nuremberg celebrated the 50th anniversary of "Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a pompous railway station festival in Pressig.
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” recalls Georg Dinkel.
Soon after the out.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig Railway Station was history.
"The rangers and stop shoes have done the most difficult work in rail traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why Pressig-Rothenkirchen Railway Station led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with start-up success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the World Ranking Third is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Victory led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian put to number 13 gave up.
The Swan now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Kunst und Genuss" a special exhibition was opened on the weekend in Mittelehrenbach.
With great relief, registered organisers and visitors saw the ideal weather when the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the outdoor grounds of the property Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund um Walberla" as part of the series "Art and enjoyment".
She opened her doors in the fifteenth year.
A great visitor encouragement showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 specimens of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Houselord Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann greeted the artists for the opening of the vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task in proven young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists in the past and have contributed to designing flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Art & Genuss, there is again a 70-cent special letter brand designed by them, available at every art station.
There, too, this year's poster "Betzn ausdanzen", designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high encouragement of the special exhibition.
For the musical framing, Max Marcus Stadler was obtained from Nuremberg.
While walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "windplay performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately playfully expresses it.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramic, often with coloured accents.
Already at the entrance of the property the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, color-lit, playfully equipped with 20 windmills, 24 horsepower and 24 aluminium tubes as a piece of sound.
With the sun shining through the bush movement in the background, the object looks fairytale and invites to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who prefers to dedicate herself to the event 15 years of K&G in three-dimensional letters.
There are many parts, in the wind moving.
Halfway Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination structures made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "windplay performance" for walking through the versatile art exhibition.
Until 31 December 2018, the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate their 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and the student movement.
And the Albanians also made their disgust air at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want to accept everywhere that after the dissolution of the church chorus "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the neighborhood.
In the meantime, it has become a legend: at a bench in the thin bush, they lifted the MGV 68 albahte from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated greatly in the "House of Encounter".
"It's going to be full today," chairman Jürgen Holstigee guessed, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachian singers.
On the occasion of the anniversary, they had revived the foundation festival.
For years it was a tradition, then there was a break.
At the time of the 50th anniversary, the festival of tradition was back.
An elegant ball was asked to get festive clothes beforehand.
The guests did not sit as usual in the "house of encounter" in rows of seats, but comfortably at tables.
DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance floor.
It is an honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves made their voices sound.
Suitable for the occasion were cheerful songs.
Almost already set, "Such a day, as beautiful as today."
Suitable for the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wine".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hops".
Again, the choir conductor was sovereign of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinenbush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstige said: "He has such a light way, it's a masterpiece he does." By the way, this time not only men presented themselves singing.
The women's choir "High C" was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.
After all, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at the desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented sounding poetry.
There was also a big Tombola.
The proceeds will finance a visit to the All-Weather Zoo for the children of the Albatros Youth Centre.
Singers Celebrate 50th Birthday Celebration
Volleyball: 3rd Women's League: USC II wins top-class derby against BW Aasee
The ascendant marched.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of USC Münster under the auspices of Axel Büring finds itself really well in League Three.
No trace of shyness or fracks, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"It wasn't clear, but we have already made an impression," says the quite satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: "This is a defeat that we can live very well with.
We are not dissatisfied."
In the evening at a birthday party after Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game broke out.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they get to the target, a game like this can be a hit," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full yield to its target.
“We are all aware of who is on the other side of such a derby.
That doesn't break our neck.
I’ve seen really good volleyball in phases,” Annacker didn’t quarrel with the 0:3 – and immediately went on the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents goes seems unpredictable after just three game days.
“It’s just too early for this,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
In the fourth league, they don’t want to turn their eyes down anymore.
If the vest is not polluted in the coming weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee will arrive in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dream ship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series may have had a complicity in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as head hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the "dream ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left board forever.
The series that made her a star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues perceived me on equal eyes," Keller tells in a conversation with the "Bild am Sonntag".
Initially, she was only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
For now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
“I don’t know if he liked it so much.”
She thinks it’s possible that her husband at the time might have been quite jealous, but “as many men, Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings.”
Keller has always tried to be the only one right for Hans von Borsody and he did not want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I’ve changed myself,” she explains further.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I never really was, even though I sometimes seemed rude and courageous on the stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time too."
The day before the wedding, I was crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody's marriage also failed.
Why did it never work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at the time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I approached love too naively.”
The NZZ-Resort Zurich, who regularly explores the city’s nightlife, has dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our wrinkle is not a moth, but a little light-frightened.
And the brilliant gloss in which a green carpet is immersed on the six-loop square dazzles him overwhelmingly.
But it’s a film festival, where more or less famous people would like to sun in the headlights.
Thus, on this late Thursday evening, he twists over the square to make himself easier in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
This is how the public toilet facility, sponsored by a large sanitary company, is named, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: The necessity facility on the ground floor of a new pavilion puts a lot of effort to create a luxurious atmosphere.
That evening, however, in the Men's Oasis it smells to heaven for some reason.
So get out of here, go to the other side of the street: Invited guests who have just entertained the opening movie "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema next door, celebrate the festival's beginning every year with a party in the three-storey warehouse.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: as is known, the works shown come from all over the world.
What do you not have to think of in an article about this festival so as not to fall into blue advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The fold binds a bunch around the feelers, which gave him a good fairy, and two bullish doorkeepers actually wave him in generously.
Inside, the invited push, dance far after midnight to live music, or let themselves pretend by DJ rhythms, to which they scream to each other, and rinse down with cupli delicious hops.
In the delicacies shop in the underground, oysters await crisp mouths, next door the unparalleled crude ham Culatello di Zibello is cut freshly, a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without significant losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the sign at the rolling stairs: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the rolling stairs."
Should this be two separate instructions, he missed the dress code.
But it is rather a conditional construction, and it has certainly already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor the poultry tips a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", matching the festival award.
This mix, which a capsule manufacturer presents itself with, does not necessarily receive the award for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising for that brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But as, between local prominence, cassette table and kitchen items, a face passes that seems known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor shouldn't be far away.
And truly: Viggo Mortensen walks through the crowd, with soon sixty almost like a chorus.
He's not beaten, he's not beaten, he's only beaten.
Especially for this restraint, likely misunderstood as stubbornness, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is pleased with the victory of his team.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory in his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in a yellow jersey, inspired by the players.
The Mexican second league champion defeated the Leones Negros with 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to last minute slot "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieltzki, coach of the handball league ASV Senden, could hardly believe: "Such a bitter defeat". His defenders were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - failure - fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly, as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, over long phases, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we have totally asleep," angry the ASV trainer.
The householders quickly led with 8:1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not initially fruit.
"Then suddenly a ruck has gone through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter hour.
For the rest, the remainder was only two goals.
Above all, sending Bester, Marius Hintze, met each other in the phase.
After the change, it became even better from the viewpoint of visitors.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst balanced to 15:15, then the season changer was almost continuous.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still seemingly calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
The impartial are involved in the events.
Bieletzki usually avoids looking for guilt in others.
But: the 120-second time sentence that Steffen Mühlhoff received was “a joke.”
LIT laughed well and hit four times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, stood well at the back against seven men and threw them again and again to the empty gate.
Only you can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a damn victory has to come," said the fully served Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hüging (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an eighteen-year-old man from Naila, the police are looking for the remains of the woman.
On Saturday, military forces opened a street at Marxgrün.
For this purpose, the street flooring and several layers underneath were removed, as police and the prosecutor’s office shared.
According to new findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from their place of residence at the time.
The woman has disappeared since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not exclude a crime either.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Court, together with the Prosecutor’s Office, has once again worked intensively on the case.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Monumental Protection Authority, the investigators came across an eye-catcher under the street by means of a ground radar at Marxgrün.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officials confined the site to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users reveals the dangers lies on the net.
However, users can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated sequences of letters, users should rather use password phrases to secure their accounts on the net.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, also it does not harm to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, the founder of electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening withdrawal as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. Stock Exchange Supervisory SEC out-of-court filed a litigation over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to conduct listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay $20 million each, and Musk resigns the office of chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Chief Supervisory Board.
Chairman of the Board of Directors may remain against it.
In the comparison, which still needs to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC sued the world-renowned manager in the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also runs space company SpaceX, is the public face of loss-writing electric car pioneer, which is now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock exchange.
Musk is not conscious of guilt.
Musk said he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed with the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay $420 per share, the financing is secured.
Tesla would have been valued at $72 billion in total.
Later Musk rebuked: Tesla remains on the stock market.
After the agreement, Tesla will now have to find a chairman coming from the outside, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.

Record champion Manchester United slides deeper into the crisis after the worst start of the season since 1989.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost to West Ham United with 1:3 (0:2) and remains with ten points after seven game days only in the mid-score.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow ahead of the Champions League match against FC Valencia on Tuesday.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno came to his first Premier League operation after a Petr Cech injury.

Polls: 46 percent will not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
According to the queries of the past few weeks, GroKo has received several survey depths.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically viewed.
Berlin - The AfD has for the first time overtaken the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday nationwide.
In the weekly survey by the opinion survey institute, the AfD increased by a count to 17 percent, while the SPD dropped a point compared to the previous week and landed at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value to date for the Union on Sunday.
The Greens reached 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If it were the Bundestag election on Sunday, the ruling parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the vote together, according to Emnid.
Thus, the major coalition has currently lost a majority on the Sunday issue at all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach.
The ruling parties consistently obtain 43 to 45 percent of the vote (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag election, they received 53.4 percent.
The bandwidth of the other parties is also large: The AfD, the second-most party in several polls, reaches 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reached a vote of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is at an average of 10%, while the FDP is at 9%.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the percentage of votes.
But also support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has declined significantly since the 2017 Bundestag election.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Chancellery, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
Only one in a second (50 percent) would like the major coalition to hold in three years until the next regular Bundestag election, with 41 percent in favour of a new election.
Another survey published on Saturday also showed significant losses in popularity for Merkel.
The Germans also judge whether Merkel should again run for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47% are in favour and 44% opposed.
64% of EU supporters want a candidate, 35% do not.
Aldi's Extension: Price Reduced to Love Happiness
Will Aldi be Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says there are no more romantic acquaintance stories in the times of Tinder should talk about turkey meat with Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "fastfood dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a meeting place for the great love shines almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short deal at the wulf table, or the favorite pudding is still in doubt a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is a reputation for being less a contact but rather a slick stock exchange.
We dared the test: how do women react when you don’t talk about the hot grain for a long time in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
The Hollywood lovestory potential has it when love happiness precedes an out-of-the-eyes-lost-and-refound plot.
If the guy still contacts his worshipper at bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, it is the author of this announcement in an Aldi store unknown to us that she will find her dream man, with whom she talked briefly about the "30 percent reduced organic pudding meat".
For belief in the magic of analogue acquaintance, she definitely deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgerschule has been participating in the action "Cover against polio - 500 covers for a life without child paralysis".
Polio is an abbreviation for polio, an infectious disease caused by polio viruses.
The disease referred to in German as paralysis leads to symptoms of paralysis to death.
In Germany, polio is considered extinct, but there are still three countries worldwide where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be cured by vaccinations, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion on Mario Götze's shape and fitness.
“We should stop worrying about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us," said Reus, who was friends with idols, after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen on TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Football: Eberl: No rush to contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the national football league Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no rush in a possible extension of the contract with coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not even talked about a contract yet.
There is no fixed date when we will do this.
"But there will surely be the moment where we will sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky on Sunday night.
Football: District League: Researcher appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine gives courage
There were moments in this still young season, where Alois Fetsch went to the court with his own hard.
Wortkarg gave up himself, the coach of the district football league VfL Wolbeck, first withdrew (interiorly) to reflect on the lack of willingness to perform on the green.
It's all history.
In the meantime, it runs around again on the Brandhoveweg.
Taufrischer Beweis is the 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine, in the past season only slightly scrapped past the climb.
Yes, I am very happy with the performance.
"We tightened the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and searched each individual for the match, simply saying "thank you" for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury to Nico Frerichs (muscle problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1 where Niklas Thewes was waiting for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), the interchange Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost that would have been a revenge when the SCA in the 41st minute twice in the face of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer struck up dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his skill.
After the break, the VfL unfortunately took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed almost.
Schroer also arrived late after 58 minutes at a Thewes release.
With the conversion of Miles Geske, Fetsch on the left side missed once again a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrhein's Chris Naberbaumer dropped in the 70th minute of Robin Westhues, there was an indirect free kick for the placers 18 meters in front of the guest housing.
The foul came in itself and demonstrated its danger at standards.
Westhues" thing with the right slide beat down to the left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes that should be fucking long.
And then this: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew the leather unfortunately at his hand in the 80th minute.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before Geske still had the victory hit on the push in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
It might have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes
"Researcher's appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine gives courage"
Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4:1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five game days - that was not enough for coach Adi Hütter.
At Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to secure the first home victory.
Striker Ante Rebic, who stood in the starting elf for the first time after an injury, should help with this.
Midfielder Luca Torró was also there again after a shame injury and was meant to prevent the SGE from winning further goals according to standards with his headball strength.

Helicopter crashed in Kottingbrunn
On the landing, it was an accident at the airfield.
The four inmates were slightly injured.
Around 2 p.m. on Sunday, there was a drama at the airport in Kottingbrunn.
When a helicopter landed, turbulence occurred, police confirmed to Oe24.
The helicopter was captured by a windfall, cracked on the ground and ended up side by side.
Immediately, police, rescue and firefighters were contacted.
With a large bid, the forces arrived at the accident site.
The ÖAMTC notary helicopter was also called for caution.
Inmates only slightly injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one damage to matters.
The four inmates were only slightly injured and were able to go home independently.
The exact circumstances of the accident have not yet been clarified and are the subject of the investigation.
According to firefighter spokesman Franz Resperger, there was a small fire that could be quickly erased.
Allbright Foundation Report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As of September 1st, only 8 percent of the boards were female, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and previously presented to the German Press Agency.
“Companies will have to set up differently, otherwise international competitors will pass them,” said Stiftung CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the U.S., UK or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams – with few exceptions – are no longer conceivable.
The lag makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive impulses among the companies of the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards of directors are female.
Last year, however, the value had remained at 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women stagnated.
Recently, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I'm sure the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that they would not continue to undertake a commitment to increase the share of “zero percent” so far.
Another picture appears from the supervisory boards: as of September 1, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"As many women were recruited to the boards every year, 40 percent would have reached by 2023," the report said.
Some even make crazy: luxury cars: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari is best deserved.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make a profit of 69,000 euros.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Who among the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers get per car they sell?
This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and Professor of Economics Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with every car sold – Jaguar Land Rover only comes at around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put strongly on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in the race with prices from on average 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and around 3,000 euros in profit before interest and taxes EBIT.
On her 38th birthday, tennis legend Martina Hingis announced on Twitter that she would become a mother for the first time.

In July, she married the Zuger Harald Leemann.
She didn't tell the date of birth.
Torch train for the opening of the 60th Abtswinder Weinfest
With a torch train, the tourism association in Abtswind opened its wine festival session.

You can be proud of that,” Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later met symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found the way to us again to Abtswind." Later, "The Troglauer" created a mood.
On Sunday, which also celebrated the Abtswinder Kirchweih, the club had set the drink prices in the afternoon for the occasion of the anniversary as 60 years ago.
A party evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5th, in the guest’s house, before a day later it goes into the second round in the party tent.
In Bonn: Emergency physician car crashes in taxi
A medical emergency car stands severely damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the emergency vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger was fatally injured.
When emergency physicians are called, they should help - better even save lives.

The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car struck a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then met at a crossroads with the taxi that drove at Green.
After the collision, the doctor's car threw against a traffic light mast and a tree.
He captured the passenger who still died at the scene of the accident.
Emergency car driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency medical car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from operations.
The also seriously injured 29-year-old nurse was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency physician tried this, but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
Police, in close consultation with the prosecutor’s office in Bonn, investigate who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we're uncomfortable
After the blameful out of the League Cup, Manchester United now also loses in the 7th round of the Premier League.
The manner of defeat is likely to remain to be spoken against West Ham United.
Symbolically, the scene was in the 74th minute, when re-recovered Marko Arnautovic shot 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly brought the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all Manchester's defenders remained, and Arnautovic allowed all the time of the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of previously insufficient performance over long distances.
At the moment, United’s city rival Manchester City is very different.
The Citizens trained by Mourino's big rival Pep Guardiola came to a roughly 2-0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling for the home team first broke through the defense bar of the outsider.
After a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, Sergio Agüero secured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer leaders
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri won a 1:1 against Chelsea with Liverpool in the Premier League.
Like the Cup-Out, Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man among the Londoners.
The 27-year-old score in the 25th minute remained the only score in the game until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless balance sheet, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
At first the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, due to the remis in the league the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2:0 victory.
The fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait for a success message against the surprise team from Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unfortunately dropped Alex Iwobi’s input into his own goal, but just two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal moved past Watford for the fifth consecutive victory and is newly ranked fifth immediately behind the great rival Tottenham, a strong impression continues to leave Wolverhampton climbing under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the league in the 2:0 against Southampton for the fifth time in a row and took 8th place.
VW Core Brand Missing: Paris Motor Show in Sign of Diesel Debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic but pervasive: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofits should not be allowed by German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Automobile Show, they will showcase their novelties from next week together with competitors from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn’t really play a big part anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofit offerings for diesel owners in Germany, which will be negotiated by then with the government in Berlin, should still be an important topic at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingolstadter is expected to come on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgarter 2019.
Both have been officially presented.
The BMW iNext is expected to be launched in 2021.
The focus in Paris is on the new 3rd.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from October 4th to 14th.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were more than a million visitors.
At least 380 people were killed in the severe earthquakes and the subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communications and transport links have been damaged, enormous material damage has occurred.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
There are concerns that the numbers of victims will rise significantly.
So far, the numbers are only from Palu.
However, many other municipalities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
About 150 bikers celebrate service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated on Sunday with a team of assistants the final service for motorcyclists in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Church of Peace in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral concerns of PS-strong two-wheel riders.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) always takes place at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
Traditionally, bikers celebrate the end of the season in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers had gathered there on Sunday to perform anything else than ordinary service.
Already from 10 a.m. the Bolids were lined in front of the entrance portal of the church.
Initially, the biker’s early sausage was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a heavy curry sausage.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also involved.
The sermon was held during the biker service of Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical underpainting was carried out by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues skirt, Valerie Lill is more poetic and quiet," says Father Frank Schröder.
This was certainly a novelty in the history of motorcycle service, too.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big festivity: After the apple comes the milk
And also on the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple cakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also very interested.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his amazing spectators step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the large funnel.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Unfortunately, many of the children couldn’t imagine how it would become a tasty drink.
But they were also able to look at this important work step this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and surrounded by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces that looked a little like hacked material layer by layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of the work did not become so difficult at all.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the fox farmer also had ready-made specialties.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the latest feather whites to older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly high.
In a cosy atmosphere, the parents came into conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built jumping castle for themselves.
Activists of the Füchtorer camaraderie of former soldiers also engaged in the party and invited at some stations to play fun games.
The home club will also be offering an action day next year.
Then, however, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home house in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also evident due to the topic: after all, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season finish: "Fucked situation"
After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Hannover 96 professionals and encouraged them courage.
However, there was a lot of positives not to be seen before in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a fucking situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after, "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The further unvictory Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86th) met to join, stand with two counters at the bottom and are in their current constitution a descent candidate.
Led by the superb Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated its first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals for the DFB Cup winner, who finished after the successful general sample for the Europa League match against Lazio Rome with seven points in the midfield.
Croatia’s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hesse during his start-up debut and never got into control of Hannover’s defense.
The long-after-World Championship striker showed with his pace and enforceability why he is so valuable for harmonization.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan borrowed by Liverpool was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who started swivelly.
For the first time, Lucas Torró (17th)'s headball was counterfeit on the goal net.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a prospective position at the last moment by the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term failed Kevin Wimmer (back).
Leadership for the householders fell almost inevitably and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty room after a rejected corner, Haller extended by head to the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defense player arrived in the summer by the French second league player AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt lay down before the break.
This time, Haller fitted his storm partner Rebic, who skillfully tanked himself through and didn’t leave a chance to 96-goalkeeper Michael Esser.
In the mid-term Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak notion of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces into Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageous forward, but igniting ideas remained until shortly before the end, when the connecting hit still succeeded.
Hesse was much more efficient.
After just an hour, Rebic started a solo and then put it across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only shows for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests, also Jovic met a minute before the end.
The Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Despite cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in downtown.
The mayor of Munich, Dieter Reiter, managed it in front of millions of audiences at the opening of the 185.
Munich Wies'n last week with two beats.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross on September 14 or Sunday afterwards.
The festive service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ, who comes from the 30-year war and who, according to legend, was shot by a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed from the shooting wound.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
It has not yet been completed, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite the significance for the Geisinger parish.
After the divine service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Cross Festival ended.
For many years, the Catholic Church Choir has invited the Catholic parish home to the secular part of the festival.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food as well as a wide selection of cakes and adapted to the weather, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to facade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After the scaffolding has been in place for some time, the damages could be determined more accurately and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is sure that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damages already existing a few years ago have become greater, but more have also been found, which was only made possible by the inception by means of scaffolding.
The socket plastering works are completed, the natural stone works are to be started before winter and half of these works are expected to be completed this year.
Inauguration: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller Life Aid opens a new residence for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to his destination - that was when all the present were agreed at the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair users who have already lived in the residence of the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time are dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, hallways and doors, larger spaces and access to all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first planning began about eight years ago when the former officer building of the US Army was tested for residents with mobile cap: "The house had come into the years and was no longer up-to-date in the equipment," Bader explained, looking back.
In 2016, the excavators moved to tear the house down.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life aid Danube-Iller opens new residence
Around €4.6 million was invested in new construction.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works have remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and financial terms.
The managing director of Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to be able to move without any foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, commented: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need tools to be mobile".
The habitability and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The plot in this situation is a real luck case, because it is no longer so to be acquired in the current situation."
Overall, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, divided into three residential groups.
Pride is the director of life aid Heinz on the eleven full-time workers, all of whom are employed according to tariffs.
Germany: Differences between East and West
Before the Day of Unity, SPD Deputy Federal Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to comply with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after nearly 30 years of unit.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans on average worked longer than the people in West Germany, but would receive 15 percent less salary.
“I can’t explain this to anyone almost 30 years after the German unity,” Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this Clean Dog End the Korean Conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae a gift to two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon’s office reported on Sunday, the two about a year old dogs reached their recipients already on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to get used to it.
The dogs with the thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendly gift was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to jointly compete in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly apply for the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile drives.
Austria's history moved in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this memorial year for nearly ten months now, numerous new books have been published, which answer this question mostly in the background of the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archive, puts it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will appear on October 1.
New Week, New Opportunity for Government
Back to real work - this is the unofficial motto for the workweek of the Great Coalition that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not recently mantra-likely sworn the "return to real work".
This may have led some craftsmen, physicians, cashiers and other working citizens in this country to the legitimate question of what is actually the difference between work and real work, but let's do it.
When the federal government is now ready to devote itself again to its mandate - governing - it should not be stopped by debates on terms.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and blame in recent weeks, perhaps Monday will show.
In the evening, the heads of the ruling parties will meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly in order to clear conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
But first of all, conflicting issues are on the agenda with diesel upgrades and the immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies escape with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to technically retrofit older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has shown an approximation over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for refused asylum seekers who are working or undergoing training.
The Union is strictly against the "track change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be again dispute between the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not Equal and Equal has joined the GroKo, but three partners with some very different societal views and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society drawn by so diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not advance.
But in order to be constructive, disputes must not be rebuilt for partitactic reasons on the question of being or not being.
This is about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue – but always keep in mind the reality of people’s lives.
What is feasible and helps many?
This guiding question allows both the diesel and the track change question to be clarified pragmatically - and thus to regain trust.
That’s why the people’s parties have to fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the sight
Does the Minister of Labour breach the law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Really day and night" her legists had worked on the social security reform, an overwhelming Social Minister reported during the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
With list-mushroom mandatary Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is astonished - she now brings the matter to parliament via a request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the involvement of her team and in no way wanted to announce violations of the applicable law of service before the cameras running."
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "excuse Har Tinger from any suspicion."
Police are shattering a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - Long the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been excavated.
The route is closed until Monday in the area of Marxgreen.
The investigators had previously deployed an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, was eventually able, together with its guide, to limit the relevant site to a few meters in repeated use.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection agency, a soil anomaly has been discovered in the area of the said street piece.
For more than a year, prosecutors and criminal police have been dealing with the missing case.
At Marxgrün, a bicycle path was locked up and investigated with sonar devices because investigators suspect that Heike’s body could have been hid here in the course of the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Barcelona riots before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is celebrated for the first time.
But there are riots beforehand.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, there were clashes between separatists and police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates, among other things, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Approximately 3,000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues who were in use at the polling stations last year at the referendum classified as illegal.
At the time, there was also violence in trying to prevent citizens from voting.
Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations separate from the separatists and the central state security forces, Spanish media reported.
Some of the nearly 6,000 separatists had attempted to break through the police chain, and threw the officials, among other things, with color bags and eggs.
Six people have been arrested and 24 others have been slightly injured, the authorities said.
Monday is the first year of the independence referendum.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to separate the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled to exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also went abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, remain in U-prison.
New elections were held in the region in December.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen split torlos
Red-White Ahlen continues on the spot.
Also at FC Gütersloh, it was only a 0:0 draw.
The final light and the third last light revealed them as assembled resentment in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadion.
The first half was well manageable by the entertainment factor.
Anyone who preferred a beer or a bratwurst could do this without worry.
There was no risk of missing a torch chance, because there was virtually no.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) goal shot of the whole game in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also the only real - possibility had the Ahlener when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty boundary.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Attacker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasingly emerging boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel targeted from 18 meters just above the housing and after an hour, the Gütersloher also appeared offensive for the first time.
After a ballot conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quickly played counter about Sinan Aygün "crowned" Nick Flock (62.) with a shot, however, in the arms of RWA-torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played a headball by Wieckowicz (66th) after a cornerball by ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and somewhat later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlener did not achieve.
Only in the 91st minute had Cihan Yilmaz the last chance, but it didn’t bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive: "I like that we played to zero", but unfortunately the zero was also in front.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as we were against Holzwickede and that even though our opponent didn't want to play here," stated RW Ahlens interim coach.
Offensively, they “pleased everything a little bit” against a team “who just wanted to defend.
I didn’t feel like we could get a goal,” Daut said.
As a spectator, however, he didn’t feel like his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Harvest Thanksgiving: Fortunately there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Edition, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld."
At the opening, the sky was brightly blue, while the space was still a little empty, but that was expected to change over the course of the day.
Because: "Here it's so beautifully sociable, that's why we're here today," one visitor said.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a neat touch of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which was to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer jumped in short term.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there are enough creams.
And the "replacement" did not take away, in the meantime, musically entertaining the increasingly growing visitors.
This came so well that at the late hour some folk songs were sung.
"Simple great," Marcel Kreimer was pleased.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date on his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many actives with their stands, mostly clubs.
"In fact, there shouldn't be anything like a table at all," he thanked for the action of the men's chorus.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all who were in operation at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful paint - here's something.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück removed the mai crown with the help of the fire brigade and brought it to the winter quarter.
In many stands worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was to have everything.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has lived in Reckenfeld for only a year, has become creative with his decoupersaw.
Furniture works, beer covers with rectangle field motifs and much more he had on offer.
A specialty offered three beekeepers: "Beekeepers Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter also has a specialty.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, so the cake tasted well.
It is the sociality that allows visitors to stay long until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the Autumn Festival.
Lubrication with local policy message: No successful advertising for skateboarding
In Lengerich, unknowns have hardly advertised in a favourable way for the construction of a skateboarding plant.
In several places there are corresponding lubricants, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges have been filed with the police for property injury.
The three words "Skatepark für Lengerich!" appear in large letters on signs, among other things, at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on September 19, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign at the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message of that time was apparently "only" left with an edding, it could be easily removed.
“A few days later, however, it was back, sprayed this time,” Rottmann said.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given precisely in this case because several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate system is built, its realization will also be enabled by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the City School, Sports and Culture Department, without mentioning names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that stand on the lubricated board.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the topic of skateboarding.
After the old one had been mined at the LWL-Clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council voted in favour of the fire station.
However, this suggestion was not implemented - too many factors apparently opposed a construction at this point.
At the end of June there was a reversal.
The members of the Chief and Financial Committee now unanimously voted for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word is the City Council.
It is going to take a decision this year so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Closure in air traffic is getting worse
After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air controllers see no sign of improvement in the coming year.
“This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come,” said Matthias Maas, head of the air traffic union, the German press agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on October 5.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known need of personnel in European air traffic services, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new lots will take four to five years," the union official said.
Throughout Europe, the market for finished-trained lots has been emptied.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone for the monitoring of the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized the failure of various air unions to participate in the summit.
In the Hanseatic City, representatives of the federal, countries, air traffic, airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, that won't go without us," said the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air traffic control company.
Maas once again made the EU Commission’s rules responsible for the Lotsen-Misers.
Traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running by 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost requirements and personnel savings in national air navigation systems are now fully integrated into the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to engage in Brussels for regulations that "not further cord the air to air traffic."
Currently, the EU rules would be voted by 2024 and there are concerns about further tightening.
The EU is exposed to constant lobbying pressure on the part of airlines.
“Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary and his colleagues now harvest exactly what they have sown in recent years,” Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs for airlines will lead to a change of thinking.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Force (DFS) offers a “coherent training and future pact,” Maas said.
The annual admission of 120 lots students over the next five years, which has been announced so far, is just enough to compensate for age-related departures.

ThyssenKrupp Supervisory Board votes for Group Rebuilding
The members of the thyssenkrupp supervisory board unanimously voted in favour of the plans for the group’s restructuring.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp’s interim chief executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the board at the meeting on Sunday, the crisy group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are expected to have their headquarters in Essen and to be listed on the stock market.
There should be no additional personnel reduction beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the control body on the capital side has only eight heads.
There are 10 representatives of the employees.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is expected to include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business will be bundled with elevators and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence against demos by police and Catalan proponents of independence.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police and Catalan proponents of independence in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, some 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 proponents of independence.
The Catalan police have attempted to keep the two protest movements away from each other with a large bid.
According to the forces, however, proponents of independence tried repeatedly to break through the security barrier.
They had attacked the officers with color and shotguns.
According to the reports, there were also rangeleien between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue personnel, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to praise the colleagues who had proceeded nearly exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Spanish police and Guardia Civil officials find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police earn significantly more than they do.
The protesters felt it was a provocation that Spanish policemen demonstrated in Barcelona.
“Why did they come here to protest?”, 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they confused us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
“Of course we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: to defend the law,” he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we are doing it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues “hadn’t come to provoke,” the police officer said.

Football: Juve coach praises for top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best match together with the half-hour of Valencia this evening," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive bought star was the decisive man in the important game against the persecutor even without his own goal.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and he's doing well," Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three goal layouts, Juve turned the game after the early lag by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hanged the worst persecutor for the time being.
The goal-hunter won by Real Madrid first placed the former Bundesliga pro Mario Mandzukic, who took the lead with a double pack (26th/49th).
And Ronaldo also made the pre-work after a corner by headball for the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76th), who just had to push just before the goal line.
"He's given a lot of templates," praised the coach.
But of course Allegri also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record scorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
“We need to be even better at serving him,” the coach said.
Best Juve scorer is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus’ power seems to become even more crushing.
Seven wins in seven games is the impeccable series in the Serie A. At 21 points, the champion of the last seven years already has six counters ahead of Naples.
Former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti's trained standout against Turin didn't have a chance.
But at the latest after the place-reference of Mario Rui (58th) already warned, the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to step too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red from the pitch.
"We played well against a good Naples," Turin coach commented.
Then Emre Can was able to feel.
The German national player played for Juve.
The FC Liverpool professional was involved in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo was dropped off the pitch in the 2:0 victory of Turin and is closed for the home match against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West changes his name
Rapper Kanye West attracted attention at the U.S. TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused forehead whispers and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
From now on, we can only call him “yes,” according to the musician.
"The being, formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted after the late singer Prince, when he gave his artist's name.
The pseudonym is not news.
The 10th album was released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had stated that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means 'you'," the rapper said.
Football: Circular League A1 Münster: Finally!
It's done!
Hoetmar's coach Averhage didn't make a hole from his disappointment.
This was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simply more gripped, we have almost never put him in trouble." The list of Hoetmarer shooting options is thus thin.
Grade two goals in 90 minutes, so rarely you can make games positive.
Football Circle League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first round, but the first one used Maik Krause from a sharp angle for early guidance (7th).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after a great preliminary work by Krause, he conceded freely.
The hosts had only a double possibility as Moritz Höne at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher first failed and in the subsequent Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all pardoned.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use for the guests (75).
Only when Nils Berheide stabbed the ball over the line was the game decided (81).
“We had criticized ourselves harshly before, which was then different today than in the last few weeks,” said Florian Kraus.
Senderhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).
Red card: Kortenjann (75./Hoetmar).
Football: Circular League A2 Münster: Spektakelfußball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to think about it,” he said.
"We haven't got access to them at all." With that he said presumably the wing clamps with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites who spotted with a collective offensive urge.
Still, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, blinking freaky and drawing from there His players, on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Noticeably, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class retention.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
“That was by far our best season performance,” he says.
"The way we return after the 0:2 and the way we stand against one of the league's top teams over the whole game time, that was already really phenomenal."
The bitter it is now that you have to drive home with empty hands.
Top goal-hunter Lars Zymner brought the hosts to the lead with his 12th season goal (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side valid for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but you can’t get a player out of it completely.
"That was already madness what he did," Lewandowski acknowledged the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the side change, his own eleven managed to compensate: McGill's free kick sailed from left between Hövelmann and Concordia gatekeeper Hinkerohe through into the long torque (45).
After the side change, it was again McGill who scored the compensation (59th).
Then it went back and forth.
It was a crazy, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69).
Albersloh failed to counter the last Concordia hit (80th).
We now have to focus our full focus on Wednesday.
“The game against shampoos, that’s what we have to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strawbucker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Frähning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Strassberg wins point against Primus

Media: The entire Dynamo Dresden Bureau resigns

Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure from Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had thought he shouldn’t have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing will hold about 80 meetings by mid- next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance prize personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
The academy director Udo Hahn said proudly: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors have already been with us." The fact that celebrities at the academy in Tutzing Castle appear again and again was also a topic in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker attends a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on 29 September, writer Frido Mann is at a conference about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France’s President Emmanuel Macron has also pledged to personally receive the “Tolerance Prize” awarded him by the Academy in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television presenter Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019 have it in itself.
“The pension isn’t safe!” reads a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - so the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And at a conference on Syria: 'Barbarity without Limit'.
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death – war scoffs on every human idea.”
From structural racism in society to the scissors between poor and rich to the radical change of labour through digitization, the spectrum ranges.
A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions.

Karl Marx’s birthday will soon be expected by one more visitor to the direction of capitalism-criticism, while the others are more likely to expect a tendency “from the left to the center”.
What does neutrality look like?
"We are 100% a daughter of the Evangelische Landeskirche," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, "so we are not 100% neutral."
Music cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische News
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret lady, Teubner thought of gender understanding, not only with humor and heart warmth for the (feeled) woman and the (feeled) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used her and mastered her violin as well.
Ben Sükrüp sat on his wing.
On the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes speaks until the end of the sentence, on the other is a true pianist: Sükrüp Teubner is so congenially harmoniously accompanied that some may have desired a solo.
That was the same, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, the way it fitted the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had put into play a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but she does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not bring any benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have emerged from Mozart’s composing if “the nannerl” had opened the door unexpectedly?
Thus, in improvisations, Sükrüp glides over, from Bach's "O Haupt full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's g-moll symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers presented Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the club, the chansonette.
But chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not take an additional thanks.
She had the idea of giving the duo one in Wolbeck in addition to performing in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Women's country league: Ahlener SG retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlener women had problems especially with third league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone scored ten goals.
"I was really satisfied with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We haven’t got them under control,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he got more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
The focus at the end missed his team this time.
As a result, the ASG followed a lag nearly to the end, laying behind at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45).
It was only near the end that the hostess’ broader bank became decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu put back space Merle Klement on the left-hand side, which then "made the decisive goals extremely clever" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of the BSV East Bevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the BSV Ostbevern women have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
In the second-league downgrade VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won 3:1.
“It was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
This is what we’ve done,” coach Dominik Münch was pleased with his team’s almost impeccable performance in the fallen leader.
In the first phase, the guests dominated almost at will.
At 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12, he went to the Deputy Master of the previous year at 25:15.
Food took in two bars, but didn’t come into play.
We've been busy with them.
Our opponent has beaten at high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence the BSV led already at 12:8. "Eating has switched the acceptance to three bars.
We couldn't keep the pressure.
Food has sucked up, and we have a little indulged," Münch continued.
At 18:17, the first time the Ruhr-based volleyballers had their nose at the front.
In 19:24, Ostbevern rejected four set balls, but the fifth attempt reached his goal.
"The game was now a better class," said the exercise manager to the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "We played there consistently and quietly."
About 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue-White Passage brought four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was elected the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Opening of the mosque as a missed opportunity
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way of inaugurating the great Ditib mosque in Cologne by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The opening of the mosque in Cologne has left a heap of sharpening in the German-Turkish relations that can only be tirelessly reversed together," TGD chairman Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network, said.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance of a joint, reconciliating appearance.
“Rather than side by side with German leaders to emphasize the Muslims’ belonging to Germany, Erdogan has used the appointment for his purposes,” Sofuoglu said.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "encouraged many reservations".
Home Association Nottuln: Offer has already established
After the long summer break, it’s finally folktreff time again.
On October 18th (Thursday) at 7:30 p.m., the home association Nottuln already hosts its fifth emergency folk meeting in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
Almost exactly on the day, it’s been a year since we did a folk meeting for the first time.
Meanwhile, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I wouldn’t have thought that our folk meeting would blow so quickly in Nottuln eta.
Whether the storm deep Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace room of the Ammannai was always fully occupied.
“The program at the next Folktref is, as always, a colorful mix of German folk, hiking and sailor songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits,” says Karl-Heinz Stevermürer, who invites friends to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer pledged his first folktreff "birthday" with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighboring Steinfurt district that played music with flat German lyrics.
Now he's on the road with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folktreff are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frogs in the Night" enthusiasticed the listeners and sent them home with an earworm.
“We expect many cheerful guests to once again spend a friendly and humorous evening,” the home club’s invitation reads.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to participate actively is invited to participate.
Since the sought-after seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The folk meeting starts at 7:30 p.m., but entry is already at 7 p.m.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by October 24.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step on the way to the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese Competition Authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
Thus, for the billion-dollar merger, there are still permits in South Korea and - as the biggest obstacle - in the US.
According to an insider, the chances of approval had recently improved because Linde pledged to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stamberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the Circle Association for Gardening and Land Care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impulses for the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a large anniversary in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
Of course, he was called another name at the time: as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was lifted from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association was also different from today's work - it was indeed purely about fruit-growing, about flowers and gardening, no one was thinking about it at the time.
“At that time, in the era of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites,” said Günter Dippold, a district home caregiver.
Fruit trees should line highways, so-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening associations in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is by far not exhausted.
Natural gardening, organic plant protection, village embellishment and nutrition play an equally important role as conveying knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
How versatile the functions of a gardening association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Moulbüches" entertainingly showed on stage.
“Youth work is urgently needed especially in the digital age,” said Günter Reif, district chairman, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The chestnut gathering was a huge thing for us kids, I doubt that you can collect a lot of joy with Smartphone & Co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with councillor Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, decides the Kreisverband", added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the particular importance of gardening associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the district left no doubt about this, as well as circle managers and specialist advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the circle association and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Earlier everything came from the garden, for the winter it was intaken.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm garden turned into a decorative and residential garden.
“Nature has existed, it was already there before us and we need to orient ourselves towards it,” said the fruit and nut tree expert.
That is why there is the incentive for the gardening associations not to fail so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, added the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
“We have to stop the sharp decline in insects, that is what we owe to our children and grandchildren,” Günter Reif concluded the successful celebration, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada’s Foreign Minister moves UN speech
Mexican government wants clarity on Nafta: They are giving both trade partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and postpones her speech to the United Nations.
Due to time pressure in the fight for a re-edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the US and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN general debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will only speak Monday before the UN General Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, she focuses on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States had 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wants to join the trade agreement already made between its country and the United States.
The U.S. and Mexico agreed on a recast of the regional free trade agreement Nafta in August.
U.S. President Donald Trump said Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Discussions about a new edition have been ongoing for over a year.
They are now to be completed by Sunday evening (local time), with Trump’s administration planning to present the agreement to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s appointed President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Bolsonaro presidential candidates
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The far-right ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper O Globo.
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will hold public appearances in the South American country last week ahead of the presidential elections.
The politician was attacked on open streets in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people in several Brazilian cities went to the streets to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele no" (in German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had called for protests against the ex-military.
In social networks, the associations also mobilized against Bolsonaro’s racist and women-despicable statements.
Thousands of protesters were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital Brasilia, the protests mixed with a demonstration by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the place of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for corruption and therefore cannot run.
The presidential election in Brazil will take place on October 7.
As the former mayor of the millionaire city of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
Although the “Trump of Brazil” has been involved in political operations for a long time, it has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round reach an absolute majority, there will be a vote on October 28.
Observers expect that Bolsonaro will not succeed in this, no matter who he is fighting against.
Bolsonaro is renowned for rushing against gays and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He is shocked with verbal disregards.
Another time he said that the supporters of Lula’s left-wing Workers Party should be shot.

After long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsens website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been on treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen had become acquainted with the band Gasolin', which was enormously successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international musicians such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978, Larsen succeeded as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen on Sunday, in a statement, recognized Larsen as "street boys" who "was against everything, but in all hearts."
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen had appeared at the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II in 2010.
Rocknight in the shoe factory: volume at the pressure hammer level
Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" suggest such a transcript of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik: pure hardrock of three bands friends.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and surroundings - all in conjunction with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly delight the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own feather and the coming CD.
In front of the stage, the band danced for a sound and powerful interaction.
Although "addition" calls are not to be overlooked, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hardrock is not equal to hardrock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich am Bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate their alternatives, sometimes reminiscent of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" is also used in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only does the longing, straightforward "Take Me Home" stunningly shift from melodic passages to the guitar-loaded rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the "The Ignition" quartet has gained a special degree of renown since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hardrock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" with her performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China of 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and unheard of.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in conjunction with the band, also put their own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
For the sound he felt even higher than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivered a rejuvenated solo while running through the audience.
A certain volume belongs to this, of course, due to the genre at ei or such a hardrock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" Rocknight, according to the mixer team, the three-part concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is at about 98 decibels.
This is for example at the pressure hammer level, but is still significantly below the controls of the "waken-fesitval", pointing to the "The Ignition" on their website.
However, with 120 decibels of nozzle-powered ears, as usual in the annual metal station in the north of the Republic, the Ahlener audience doesn’t need it at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso play and their own compositions.
“Here we stand, we took the bone saw and lit a concert evening with the power of a tiger,” all three groups, of course, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One Dead in Sail Plane Accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen airport.
On Sunday, a sailing plane crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen airport on Sunday.
According to the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, a sailing plane crashed at the airport’s exhibition car park.
The pilot was killed.
As the WAZ reports further, the flight student had been on board alone - the aircraft is supposed to be a single-seater.
The plane was already in landing at the time of the accident.
The crash site is just close to a party tent on the airport site.
Since this weekend an Oktoberfest has been taking place.
The Mülheim/Essen airport is located on the city border of the two Ruhr-regional cities and directly at the access to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a Park&Ride offer for major events at Essen Fair or Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump tells Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that North Korea’s president Kim is well-sounding despite the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
But now Trump has made a true declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “beautiful letters.”
At the age of 72, the married U.S. President has become a new flame.
The tragic thing: It is a distance relationship.
In public on Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump has found almost tender words for the half-old offspring of the Pyongyang ruling dynasty, despite the fact that in the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament proves to be quite tough pieces.
“I was tough, he too, and between us it went back and forth,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
- Okay.
No, really.
Not only did the talks with Kim melt his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also beared political fruit: Trump referred to the announced stoppage of all nuclear and rocket tests by Kim, even though critics so far see little more than lip confessions.
That the affection for the infamous “Rocket Man” of his martial threat signs – Trump’s nickname for Kim – is not likely to be heavy to everyone, the US president seemed to be quite aware.
In any case, he immediately anticipated the expected criticism of it during his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they fell in love."
How awful, how awful is that?
That's so unpresidencial.
But he didn’t care much about it, Trump said, and then pointed his finger to the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be presidential.”
But then we wouldn't push 10,000 people out there into this crash-filled arena, but we'd only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler bests visited, atmospherically as well as above all pampered by the sun: Very varied and with a good shot Oktoberfestflair has cleaned up Baesweiler's downtown on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest did not only take place in the party tent at the Firefighter Tower, but was extended by the Commercial Association on Sunday to the City.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison video
Nigerian refugees have pointed to their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya using a cell phone video, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had shooted the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under life-threatening and spread it online.
"They refuse to send us back," a man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees finally flew to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in an attempt to reach Europe across the Mediterranean.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life.
One of his fellow soldiers was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
Approximately 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been returned to their homes this year through the program, IOM spokesman Jorge Galindo said in the West African country.
The case of the Nigerians now rescued is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
He hasn’t heard of a help call by cell phone yet.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in Libya’s refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, dominated by large parts of militias, is the main crossing country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the village school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a thief.
At 4.50 p.m., the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the first floor she saw a man fleeing immediately.
First through a door, then through the roof terrace and from there through a staircase to the ground floor or the front deck.
The teacher contacted the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen is not yet to be said.

Germans have been trapped in their own car for days
A 75-year-old man had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in Central France after trapping the car away from all the forest paths and blocking the car door by a tree.
Rescue workers discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by chance near a pasture and released the missing person since Tuesday night, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The retiree had been reported missing by his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a trip with his off-road car through the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the man’s stay remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) warned in a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own claims, the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently “overshadowed,” Laschet said Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
This concerns mainly waves of arrest, press and religious freedom.
He made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also reported on the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was moved shortly to a flight readiness building of the Federal Ministry of Defense at Cologne Airport.
It was originally supposed to take place at the Castle of Madness – but the castle owners had rejected it from political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan went on to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne after the talk.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are their contact persons, not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the successes in the negotiations on North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime represents the conditions soberer.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's acceptance.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its ongoing sanctions.
“The latest stalemate comes from the fact that the U.S. is relying on compulsory measures that are deadly to build trust,” Ri said in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will be the first to disarm ourselves,” he said.
That sanctions could “force North Korea on its knees” is “a dream of people who don’t know us.”
However, to build trust, his country stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri said.
However, there were no “corresponding reactions” from the US side, the minister criticized.
Due to North Korea’s nuclear and rocket program, the UN Security Council had adopted three sanctions against the internationally isolated country alone last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have been urging the United Nations to strictly comply with the sanctions in recent days.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approximation.
In June, Trump met North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
Following the first summit in Singapore, the U.S. President is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang for talks on the end of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New cuisine with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with it: white blankets and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The youth of the HoT had enchanted the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was funded by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank them for the food.
The start with the new facility was not quite easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the nasty surprise: a power failure had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of operation, the food was spoiled and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and youth wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were delighted.
"Cooks can't do it better either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or guests were allowed to eat quiche, liver cheese or cake.
“It’s really great what the children and youth have put on their feet,” said Father Frank Beckmann, while the magician Stephan Lammen made amazement with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW Board of Directors
From frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essen table, Jörg Sartor, has given up his position in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become known nationwide because the Essen table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned as Vice-Chief of the NRW Boards in July, Sartor told "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many have fallen in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, head of the NRW Tafeln-Landesverband, expressed to the dpa understanding of the decision of his long-time deputy.
The criticism took Sartor.
"I can understand his step - people have expressed themselves who didn't even know exactly why the Essener table is doing that."
Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, nothing changes," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other tables in the "Welt am Sonntag".
We should not take the approach, "without us, the people in the city are starving."
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not die of hunger.
At a congress of tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essener did not attend.
"There's a lot of sweet snuff telling me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzies who criticized me so much at the time.
SF Lorch play 2:0 Leadership - Gmünder Day Post
Football, Distriktsliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after lagging - Bettringen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 in the home game against TV Neuler, Lorch was already in the lead - in the end was 2:3 and the disappointment among the sports friends was great.
Very different from TV Hypothesen: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly defeated with 0:1, but won after 90 minutes with 2:1.
Gladbach plays twice lead - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach has to wait for an away victory in Wolfsburg.
In 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first season victory (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has maneuvered off in the first five league games with early opposing goals.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco re-established that strength with which it had taken the first place behind Bavaria last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after heavy preliminary work by Jevgeni Konopljanka, subsequently the hosts preserved the mini cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets newly from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had negotiated a 0:2 back against Bayer Leverkusen until the break, but came to the 4:2 victory in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) matched a doublet within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63rd minute, made another doublet in the final phase (86th/94th) for the crowning completion of the performance increase after the break.
The first victory was also the VfB Stuttgart.
In the meantime, the Stuttgarters had to frighten against Werder Bremen because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic already before the break.
Borna Sosa and the careless Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler manufactured a curious throwing owner gate that helped guests balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a complete success, but neither did he experience a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, who played with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave twice a lead, played 2:2 and have been waiting for a victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's 1:1 compensation with his second Bundesliga player.
At the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as did the second counter-strike after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa turns out to be a goalkeeper in the storm of foals.
The French record purchase from OGC Nice hit Wolfsburg for the third time in a row and for the seventh in the seventh mandatory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach takes 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgart counter whom ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis finished with his first seasonal hit, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: the 23-year-old Serb won after a shirt copper against Daniel Didavi Yellow-Rot.
While Stuttgart’s defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremers back into the game through a curious throwing owner’s goal (68th), a quarter of an hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the over-acting Stuttgarters back onto the Victory Road.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens started the home team with Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new names
Approximately 1.8 million people in Macedonia today vote on whether to change their country’s name to North Macedonia.
With a yes, the nearly three decades-long conflict with neighbor Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change due to its northern province of the same name and blocked every approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters also decide on the future western integration.
The U.S. had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member with a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrian in U-Jail.
A refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian brutally beat three retiree women and injured them in part severely.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker randaled around 10 p.m. on Friday at the Escape Gasse in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who started on passengers with fists and tried to attack them, to his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to beat and kick the officials.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had beaten three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground at a tram stop on Währinger Straße shortly before.
He also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the retirees were severely injured.
They suffered hematomas, bruising and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured “for an unknown reason,” police said.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored continuously during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost exactly a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave their yes in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was unquestionable for her, Kahrs had previously told the Bild newspaper.
"If we get married, it's right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary spokesman for the SPD Bundestag fraction and one of the spokespersons of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals on June 30, 2017, Kahrs had aroused a rage.
He accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having stumbled on the topic.
"This was your Shabowski moment," he said, referring to the accidental announcement of the GDR border opening by Günter Shabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hedge cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizens' Association Children's House and the Society for Leprosy.
Because about 400 meters of hedges around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, the work took place for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce the costs," said Walter Schröer, chairman of the Citizens' Association.
And so much has been accumulated.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but fortunately it is now just a cut.
The hedge has already been shaved in the spring.
Breakfast has also had a long tradition.
“It should all be at their best,” said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoe Lalom World Cup
Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canoe-Lalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of seconds.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the facility and everything fits today," said the London Olympic third party in 2012.
Towards the goal, he threw his paddle away from joy and stretched both arms securely up to victory, knowing that it would be enough at least for a medal.
After all, he had starting number four.
However, the six remaining starters couldn’t hit its fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting police inspection reports the first burglary attempt this autumn into a single-family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - this is what thieves want to take advantage of again.
Thus, the Gauting police inspection yesterday reported the first burglary attempt this autumn.
The fact that it remained at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße during the attempt is due to the alarm system.
This happened when the perpetrators laid hands on Friday just before 8 p.m.
The burglars knew that the residents were not at home.
But the alarm system seemed to surprise them so much that they fled without prey.
Advice to PI Gauting, phone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Bankruptcy at Hertha: Reality: Bavaria against Ajax demands
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin does not want FC Bayern to "please".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate factor for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance dam under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase to the larger fall low for the Munichers.
“A week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we have a bit of reality," said Thomas Müller after the earned 0:2 loss at Hertha BSC and called for a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this annoys us correctly and that is why we are giving gas toward Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, no goal was fired abroad, as at the same time the pre-season two mandatory games in series without victory, the table lead in the Bundesliga for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation has not been as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its laufin-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful needle stitches over the outside delivered two blueprints within three days, as the last seemingly overpowered Bavaria is to be cracked.
"Those who know FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to make sure we are successful again," Kovac said.
Otherwise, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his birthplace and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the again lack of dealing with opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless make the first intermediate point of his term positive before the country game break - otherwise the tone is likely to exacerbate.
Thus, Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second royal-class appearance this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the brief preparation for the second pre-round game against Ajax begins, which also sovereignly defeated AEK Athens with 3:0 for the opening.
"We've got it in two games now, but we're going to go our goals again," National Team Captain Manuel Neuer announced.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The defender appeared in the role of a reminder.
"I don't think that's all bad luck, we have to work on it again, because we don't make the multitude of opportunities and make the mistakes behind," said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous season, the Bayern already laid behind Dortmund with five counters, which has now taken the lead again with a point of ahead.
And so Kimmich, with a blink of eyes, at least positively assessed that the public debate about the allegedly unbeatable Bavaria has now come to an end.
“Yes, that’s good,” the national player said.
It's good for the league.
DFB boss in line: Özil-Cause: Sharp Erdogan Attack on Grindel
Turkish President Erdogan has denounced the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the federation line.
A new post is now to be created.
On various stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel struggled for the interpretation of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president strongly criticized the dealings with the former world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the federation line.
Early Sunday morning, the Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the cause at the Mainzer ZDF "sports studio".
"There we have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migratory background in the U-teams - that such a thing doesn't repeat," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migratory background as a further integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel once again declared that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German-born and grown Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England,” Erdogan said on Saturday.
Honestly, as their president, I could not digest that our two young men, who have ascended to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" in contrast to Özil after the World Cup affair, which had started by photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says, “If I win, I’m a German, if I lose, I’m a migrant – that’s not possible.”
“I am very sorry that he has such an impression,” Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I have always said.
But he doesn’t see a basis for Özils’ return to the national team either.
Alongside the Brazilian native Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer will now be appointed.
“If one without a migration background clearly influences society and football and says, ‘The issue is important, we have to take care of it’, that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground where integration needs to work,” Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup out and the Özil affair, he intends to run for the office again next year as DFB president.
"I'm doing my job and I'm trying to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
One-year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - Police report that the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 a.m.
Initially, the 75-year-old was approached by a lady at the red lights in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
She told the retiree that he was driving against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange because the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a phone message about a driver who drove off the road and drove against a guiding post.
The man didn’t want local police and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the retiree has proceeded in his place of residence for decades and crashed a construction vehicle when turning.
After all, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a bad impression and couldn’t remember many things.
The damage is about 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Almost 1,000 operational forces are still in use.
Approximately four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a Bundeswehr grounds in Emsland, 980 emergency forces are still employed in the extinguishing work.
This was announced by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop stable, according to a spokesman, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of forces is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an upper ground fire had been discovered and extinguished.
Last week the disaster had been lifted, which was proclaimed well a week earlier on September 21, because it was feared that the flames could put adjacent forests and settlements at risk by wind and spark flight.
Thursday it was said that a crossing of the fire on neighboring communities is no longer threatening.
On the ground, more than 1,500 military forces tried to get the big fire under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test grounds near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones from the Bundeswehr.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with "Tornados" are also planned for the 2nd and 5th October.
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrands was moved at times up to a hundred kilometres far beyond the northwest of Germany until Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr will set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
First claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.

Referendum started in Macedonia on new names
In Macedonia, the eagerly-awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Approximately 1.8 million voters will decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the same name, the neighbor of Greece.
As a means of pressure, Athens had blocked any approach from Skopje to the EU and NATO for nearly three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they also give the starting point for the western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The Author Who Saves the Shoah from Forgetting

The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner dies in the United States in 2016, leaving a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for the afterlife.
Switzerland Launches Electronic Register for Organ Donors
The registry is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with express consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors on Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve family members in stressful situations.
People who wish to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your requests can then be obtained from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with express consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases, a card will be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the deceased’s desire.
"They then have to decide as a deputy in the sense of the deceased, which is often very stressful," Immer said.
A similar registration system already exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible donation of organs on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völkers-Albert, says.
"A register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted for a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered organ donor unless he or his relatives disagree.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in head recording
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in head recording.
He played in Wolfsburg on the weekend against 39 counterparts.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Science Museum Phaeno, the location of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Greetings from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant in the World Cup was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old retiree from France, according to senior referee Ralf Laue.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were, for example, 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
As spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, where participants performed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Greetings from Lastrup demonstrated how to hold a ball with his head in the air when counting.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Greetings was there two years ago as a 14-year-old at the time in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superbrain, genius, or wonder child, organizers can do little to Laue.
“Heart calculation can be trained,” he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stage-oriented computing competitions.
One of the disciplines includes, for example, the square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
In versatility computing, candidates get surprise tasks, for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans would also have good chances here, the chief referee said.
Otherwise, Asians are often at the advantage, because head counting is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods from early childhood.
Intrusive Appeal: Video with Naked Serena Williams: It's about Breast Cancer Early Detection
Tennis ass Serena Williams shows herself from her feeling and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer with this video and make strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings upstairs without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover their most intimate spots.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett has died of it.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, which is about early breast cancer detection that can save lives.
Serena Williams died a year ago.
At the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia, there were complications.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby’s life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clumps were then discovered in Serena's lungs.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The German government plans to significantly expand the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will send a bill on the so-called "Symbols Act" in review.
This aims to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the prohibition.
Polar cold air brings new snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shakes her beds for the first time in the west next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to meteorologists at the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters – in narrow valleys it could snow at strong intensity to about 1,000 meters, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of new snow is expected.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become winter.
Farmers are allowed to start annual kick care on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein’s farmers are allowed to start their annual Knick Care on Monday.
The unique "green whales" in Germany have shaped the landscape of the poor wooded state for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and beetles are "forest set" and for many animals and plants the last retreat rooms.
Knicks connect habitats scattered as corridors, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the Nature Conservation Federation Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of the order of Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their shelving houses.
From that time, his name "Knick" was also derived: By "knicking" the branches, the dense, intertwined demarcations could develop.
Today, between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, approximately 45,000 kilometers of hedges are stretched, giving the image of a woody, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by some 7,000 species of animals as a replacement living space.
In one kilometer of knick, up to 1,800 different species could live and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, the knick can only fulfill its ecologically important function if it is properly maintained in winter.
Otherwise it falls into a light row of trees, which in addition to the biodiversity also loses the windproof effect, Ludwichowski said.
Knick care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunami:
Have you been on site during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid supplies can also be transported.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also housed other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have run to the surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their homes, there are still earthquakes.
Because many grocery stores and also the gas stations are completely closed, people steal food and gasoline in part.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government helps out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partially running freely and finding them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information provision on the island?
At the moment we have a cell phone receiver, but it didn’t work before and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people they don’t know if they live and where they stay because people were not at home during the earthquake, but at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have any information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought, "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hits the region and they have run to the surrounding mountains.
Isn’t an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must give up Aogo and Donis for a long time

Aogo had a muscle fiber crack in the back left thigh in the 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the federal football league announced on Sunday.
At Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundle crack in the thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss matches even after the following country break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not provide a forecast for downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals slightly faster.

Biathlet Julian Eberhard peiled World Cup medal
At Olympia, Biathlet Julian Eberhard lay in the stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener will pick up the missed precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Pyeongchang Olympic sprint the one to grab near the medal.
Seven tenths of seconds were missing on bronze at the end.
“I deliberately gave myself time to process this,” says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym gym in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top form, but it just didn’t want to be.
The more motivated is the Pinzgauer to replenish the missed precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the Constitution, to win something.
Sometime you have to strike.
The World Cup Loipe in Östersund (SWE) lies Eberhard: "I have already closed the track in my heart", he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup Championship in the single race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the mass start competition of Kontiolahti (FIN) last World Cup winter.
With the season he ran in Oslo (NOR) rank two.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Investigation in Turbo Velocity
The time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI turbo-tempo investigation, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the small majority for Brett Kavanaugh, a controversial judge for allegations of compulsion.
President Donald Trump has set investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the more than 30 years ago alleged incidents.
The latest turn in the drama around Kavanaugh’s calling, accompanied by a cultural struggle, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the Archconservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared contrary to his original announcement that he would agree, but demands an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who had called the serious affirmations on Thursday “fixed,” initially abstained from further attacks on women and, on the contrary, spoke of “happiness in misfortune.”
In this way, final doubts could be eliminated, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply at an election rally because they rejected Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely limited investigators’ powers.
One is going to investigate the known accusations of two women, no more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: "They won't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses will be heard.
According to the municipality, the city of Ried's mobile radar device, installed in a "civil vehicle", is stationed on the Gartenstraße from Monday, 1 October.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixedly installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Fear has been felt
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
Nevertheless, time played a role against Mainz as well.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football matches.
It wasn’t different in the home match against Mainz 05.
“I saw every ball inside.
And there were lots of corners and lots of balls in our penalty room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
After all, the royal blues had succeeded in bringing the short 1:0 against the Rhine Hessen over time and thus the first seasonal victory under the roof and the compartment.
In fact, it could have happened differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 gave the team of chief coach Domenico Tedesco safety: "In total, the first halftime was good, both playful and pressing".
Create no headball monster
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said: "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore continued to withdraw.
And defend with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from our hearts," Schöpf said, who had no insignificant part of it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in man's creation."
In the end, only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
“We wanted to start in the initial phase with pressure and make a firework from it,” said Schalke’s chief coach.
The victory was important.
Finally we can be happy for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played smart, calm and bold, so we have to approach matches over 90 minutes
Perhaps the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: royal blue missed it, rather worrying about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice hit the bar 59/72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a shaking victory," said Tedesco: "You've already felt the fear a little bit."
So I’m glad we won.
He was not the only shaker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker observed a fire in the Leitzachtal on Sunday at about 13.30 o’clock.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - Police and firefighters soon found out the cause: An unknown man had burned garbage on a two-square-foot area on the Gschwender mountain.
According to the police, it seemed that he had monitored the fire for a long time, but then left the heat unsupervised.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachau firefighters were busy with removing and erasing.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion at equal level
In front of them is the author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauchild.
"For many years, I have made myself the task of bringing interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Meetings" - that association that cooperates with the alliance "Culture policy" in the direction of the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic in understanding.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held figures and the one or the other joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasingly arising despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
At one table sits the German society, at the cat’s table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always been at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore crucial not whether you are politically classified on the right or on the left, but rather: “Am I for or against an open society?”
At first, rather behaving, then the round of discussion is becoming more and more excited.
And there is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands out, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is on equal level.
The sociology professor does not urge his opinion, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing lesson he was also an open ear to the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties, he was intensely further discussed.
Basketball: Bonn and Gießen win opening games
The Giessen 46ers and the Telekom Baskets Bonn have finished the first day of the Bundesliga (BBL) match with a home and away victory.
Gießen competed in a hard-fought game in his own hall with 91:84 (43:46) against the Central German BC.
The ambitious Bonner won at BG Göttingen with 86:79 (49:47).
The first leader of the season is Alba Berlin after the 112:55 gala on Saturday against Science City Jena.
The German champion Bayern Munich and the former serial champion Brose Bamberg had much more difficulty at the beginning of the new season.
Munich already struggled at an 83:77 at ratiopharm Ulm on Friday, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at s.Oliver Würzburg at 84:80 on Saturday.
Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 interested parties have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the newly built area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
Mayor Roland Frick said this.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 plots, offered by the municipality at more favorable conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model, is completed.
There are more than 100 applications, says Frick.
"Currently the documents are being examined", in terms of application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieningen, it is the aim to have prepared the candidate ranking for the 20 plots by the end of the year and submit it to the municipal council.
Then the award can take place.
A total of 50 plots for single and double houses are created in the southern area of Landsham, and four plots for multi-family houses are expected to consist of eight units each.
The development is now almost complete, the roads and paths are to be asphalted soon.
A single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 plots in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality will be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 income-oriented housing funded by the Free State.
Place for 200 people
Grossly estimated on the area of the newly built Landsham-South area, housing for about 200 people is created.
Not only that: Now, in early October, according to Frick, there is the start for the new construction of a daycare facility.
There will be three kindergarten and three kindergarten groups and a multi-purpose room.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the start of the next kindergarten year.
This is how Schalkes Naldo "great sport" succeeds on the bench as well
For the third time in a row not in the starting elf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had seated not in the Schalker Startelf for the third time in a row, but on the exchange bench, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two meters tall Brazilian had spoken truly about the frustration of the soul.
But as the Schalker players gathered in the middle circle after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual and thanked Domenico Tedesco to all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom all call Naldo for the sake of simplicity, joined and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-captain, who did not bear any resentment despite his renewed reservist existence.
Wahrscheinlich Naldo, who was celebrated as the best Schalker last season, knows that he didn’t actually fall off the track with his coach – but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control."
It was not easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy to tell him, I'm honestly telling you," Tedesco told Naldo the moment he said he wasn't in the starting elf.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the matter, it’s about the club,” Tedesco justified the move.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that at present everyone can sneak through.
And that we all keep in the boat,” Tedesco explained the rotation that last caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing up as an exemplary team player on the bench.
The mood in Austria’s industry continued to accelerate its downturn compared to the eurozone in August.
The Shopping Manager Index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month level.
Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands across Europe, the Markit Institute said Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, while the euro zone’s PMI rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still below the mark of 50 meters for the 13th consecutive month, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland’s industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final light was the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer decreased, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44.0 points.
“While the slightly weakened dwelling could mean the worst has survived,” said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, industry remains the number one brake of growth – at least in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the eurozone have not fallen as strongly as since November 2011.
For the seventh month in a row, the companies decreased jobs.
Industrial production in China also declined stronger in August than initially thought.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchase Manager Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are discussed.
Tuchel's PSG team wins eighth in the eighth league game
September 29, 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in France's football championship.
At the OGC Nice, the title defender won with two goals from Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and thus succeeded in the eighth league game.
82 years ago, Olympique Lyon had made such a good start to the season in France.
Brazilian Neymar put PSG in the lead after 22 minutes and finished in the aftermath.
In the meantime, Christopher Nkunku (46.) took the 2:0.
Paris also managed the general test for the pioneering second Champions League group match against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
At the start of the royal class, Tuchel's team had to accept the only mandatory game loss this season in the 2:3 in Liverpool.
