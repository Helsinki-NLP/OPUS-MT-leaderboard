Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
The proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) causes dismay for some members of the National Assembly.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
Members of the National Assembly of all political directions are afraid to become the target of mockery.
A member of the National Assembly of the Labour Party said his group was concerned because the name "Twp" and "Pwp" is rhyming.
For non-Walesian readers: In Welsh, "twp" means "doof" and "pwp" means "Aa".
A member of the national assembly of the party Plaid Cymru said that the whole group was “not happy” and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law for name changes, said: “The final decision on names for the members of the National Assembly lies of course with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which showed wide support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of the National Assembly members, the Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) were preferred, while the option "MWP" was most supported at a public hearing.
Members of the National Assembly are apparently proposing alternative options, but fighting for consensus for President Elin Jones to submit a bill within weeks could possibly be a problem.
The reforms law will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules to disqualify members of the National Assembly and to design the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may finally vote on their names in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim rises to the Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its admission to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not acknowledge the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price payable for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“There are no more of both today.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“The social lives of people today look different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people meet regularly.”
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not suffice as long as the heads of the church assume, and that they will “be at the beginning earlier or later.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums where people live who do not support the remaining shelters.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were erected by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community withdrew in the 1930s.
A black community holding their worship services nearby became owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned to rebuild, they commissioned the bell play.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly described the bell play as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who ringed the bell play in July used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world’s first bell play played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger bell play at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in the past few months at St. Martin’s is a complicated story with architects and contractors, some of whom have been drawn to the church’s lay leaders and some of whom have been drawn to the bishops’ diocese.
In July, the municipal board of directors of the municipality expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would attempt to pass on the costs to the municipal board, although the diocese had not been involved in the commission of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some members of the parish complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounded in California 13-year-old diving after praise
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy diving for lobster, according to official statements.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cries of help and paddled with several others to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed “I’ve been bitten!
I was bitten.”
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire key leg had been torn apart.
“I screamed that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was flying to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to push the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is attacking cosmetics departments seemingly stored with specialized assistants, boots, superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a large-scale breakthrough on the UK’s 2.8 billion-pound cosmetics market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods decline, the larger cosmetics departments in eleven branches nationwide will be tested and, if successful, will be expanded to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to use shop spaces previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods elsewhere.
According to Sainsbury's, its range of cosmetics for the first time doubled to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space and brand areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its “boutique” makeup series, making most of the products vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanding by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will be tested at two Sainsbury’s stores, opening last week in Croydon, southern London, and opening a second one later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, retailers are increasingly looking like stores as the supermarket chain is trying to fight the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since buying the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos stores and a number of Habitat stores, increasing food sales and acquisition profitability.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, which ended after a dispute about the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the tempting environment and the affordable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that challenges the previous way of shopping."
Peter Jones "angry" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a business worth 11 million pounds
“Dragon’s Den” star Peter Jones is “angry” after television presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a deal worth 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old “This Morning” presenter announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angryed “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones with her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been “angry” when television’s “Golden Girl” admitted at a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, because of their new businesses – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – to be able to devote enough time to the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and would have likely doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, “Truly was by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure their future over the next decades for them in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw was completely surprising to all the parties involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, one of the most promising stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in launching.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will be a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night, “We are not commenting on his business affairs.”
Tough words "and then we fell in love"
He joked at the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive comments about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said imitating the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a big step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Nevertheless, the denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, told leaders from around the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a “corresponding response” to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. observed sanctions to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, support for the release of hostages, and return of the deadly remains of American military members.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would stand here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
“Unfortunately, they have made it very clear in many cases that they are not seeking international support, so that’s a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children puts together a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency, said Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu as to whether international agencies should be involved in the relief actions.
In the face of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami protections have been built in Aceh, these are not a daily sight on other coastal strips.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning that came into force, probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is already a challenge in the best case.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A laboratory ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign and has spent abundant funds on roads and railroads.
However, the government of Joko seeking re-election next year suffers from funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure by persistent confessional tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practise a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes and homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machets, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores deep balance against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London’s Stamford Bridge Stadium with a score in the 89th minute ahead of a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at a 0:1 retreat from his team at about 27 meters away from Chelsea's gate.
He targeted the ball to the left and then shot it toward the rear post.
The shot sailed high over the penal area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get myself into this position and get to the ball, players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Edge coming and I had contact with the ball, I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea scored the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute to the mid-time with 1:0.
The blues striker gave a pass with his heel back to Mateo, then turned near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the midfield.
Then he fired a good steel pass, so that Hazard entered the penalty room.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the back with a left shot.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face the UEFA Europa League Videoton at 3 p.m. in London on Thursday.
Tsunami deaths in Indonesia rise to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Civil Protection Authority said Sunday morning.
Many people are said to be trapped in the debris of buildings that had collapsed by the 7.5-size earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves up to six meters high, official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man for murder suspected after a woman was stabbed
Following the finding of a female corpse this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with stitched wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
Police urge locals to contact if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask everyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something with a Dashcam to contact us and may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found this morning.
The investigations are ongoing, and police announced that they are about to inform the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment but was informed by the police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was silent when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours to enter the building again.
It was heard that a police officer told a man that the entire area is now being treated as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the event.
She repeats again and again, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police vehicles inside the barrier and another vehicle before the barrier.
Inside the barrier were several police officers who monitored the building.
Individuals who have information are requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to the record 247 dated September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of parliament is the latest monument to be the subject of the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their exile would be poetic justice for his Taliban-reminding destruction of so many cultural and religious art products of England by his fanatic Puritan supporters.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the Palace of Westminster became the target.
The picture storm in the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believes is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today, as someone who defended parliament against pressure from the outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of continued history debates.
It is certain that the conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation in the mid-seventeenth century, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this gap.
His accomplishments as a lord protector are also worth celebrating and remembering them.”
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China.
The man, whom the surname “Yuan” was only called, was found dead with a broken bloodstream near a pig stall in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer made herself ready to inject vaccines to pigs in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He and his cousin arrived Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw a door open to a neighboring pig stall.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kilogram pig had bited the farmer dead.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and mutilated," the cousin, who was called the surname "Wu", was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Screenshots from a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned to prevent attacks on other people while police gathered evidence at the scene of the crime.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilogram pig clamped a Welsh farmer between it and a tractor until the farmer’s wife could scare the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “trigger.”
“They are just playful.
They like to twitch and are very curious, ... they are not going to hurt anyone.
You only have to treat them with the right degree of respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening along the way over the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood-causing rainfall in the coming days in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 p.m. east coast time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, corresponding to a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough is starting to form over the Pacific, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the peninsula of Baja California as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then in the coming days, the tropical humidity generates widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous flood-like flooding, driving debris in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, we expect up to 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of flood-like floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Given the threat of tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to go on foot into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become rippling streams and thunderstorms to bring local winds and dust-carrying winds.
The nearby trough brings locally heavy rain in parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation amounts of more than one centimeter are possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris driving in the water and smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first secluded tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, with widespread rain on Monday evening and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and lasts on Wednesday.
In October, heavy temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example in the middle of the United States of America of dramatic temperature differences.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 12 oC.
In the next few days, the ongoing summer heat is trying to re-develop and expand.
For much of the middle and eastern part of the United States, a warm beginning of October with widespread temperatures around 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27°C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday saw the captivating statements of Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
On Friday, the TV stations interrupted their regular program because of a last-minute twist: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, that the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate’s judiciary committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, pressing her and trying to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average viewer numbers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
Furthermore, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring spectator numbers in offices.
To put this in the right perspective: this corresponds roughly to the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented hosts strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers in all networks, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came second with 3.26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the Moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters loudly pressed him in the elevator on his way to a hearing of the judiciary committee.
The scene was broadcast live on CNN, and he stood with a lowered eyes for minutes.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said a woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the country the truth?”
“They have power while so many women are powerless,” one woman said.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcast networks broadcast live hours later when the Justice Committee was to vote on the forwarding of Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake, however, said he would do so only on the condition that the FBI, as demanded by the Democratic minority, examines the charges against the candidate next week.
Flake is partly convinced by talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and subsequently several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations raised against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of their plans to withdraw from the European Union to use Britain’s future for political purposes and undermine the nation’s interests in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson exacerbated his attack on her so-called “Chequers plan” for Brexit, calling a proposal that envisages mutual tariffs being collected by Britain and the EU “completely absurd.”
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shootings on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for killing, according to the Baton Rouge police.
The agency released video recordings of the fight between Sims and Simpson, according to the police, that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the CBS partner station WAFB, police secured the glasses at the scene and said that DNA had been found on Simpson’s glasses.
After an interview with Simpsons, the police said he admitted to the deadly shootings on Wayde.
The lawyer said the deposit was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a shot in the neck.
Police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Criminal Technical Laboratory of the Federal Police, the Southern University Police and the local citizens for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement agency for “its care and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m wing player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for LSU basketball.
Last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shocked" over Wayde's death and "was in shock".
“You’re always afraid of this,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ashes on Mexico City.
Ashes thrown out of the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of shocks and shocks.
Social media images showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since an earthquake of the magnitude 7.1 in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Collision between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between the standby police and pro-independence demonstrators, six people were arrested and thousands participated in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, retained by the police, threw them with eggs and also cast color powder so that dark dust clouds emerged in the streets normally populated with tourists.
In the course of the day, there were also handshakes with the police who used their punches to curb the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence groups screamed “no forget, no forgiveness” while facing unionists who called “Long live Spain”.
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor protests of injuries.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was seen by Madrid as illegal, but held by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had voted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although the vote participation was low as the division opponents boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the electoral locations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatists’ protest, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they were able to vote, but now we're hanging fast," he said.
Despite an important, but short, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulty maintaining the momentum this year. Many of their most well-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in custody, where they await proceedings for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict was stimulated by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is becoming more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidature for next year’s European Parliament election.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to denounce the degradation of democratic values and the oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car cracked home
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been struck several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, he may have been shot at the car with an armrest.
Menga hit means 1:0 victory over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory.
The ascended Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hits proved to be decisive for Gary Holt's team to equate Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team remains in the Premiership this season without a victory away and faces the Hearts, which lay eight points behind next Sunday.
Previously, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his winning series in the division to six games, which means that head coach Holt has not seen a loss since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against freely playing guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness put the Rangers in the face of a wide variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal, and then Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far after he was slid in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content with letting the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way the decisive goal was reached.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance where Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly brought Menga into a shot position, which shot the goal with a ball contact from the center of the penalty area.
During this phase, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but were unable to overcome the hosts' defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely uncompromised.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was repelled by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow passed the ball from a different standard Livingston situation.
Flanks repeatedly reached the Livingston penalty area and were regularly brought out of the danger area, while two required punishments were denied – one by Halkett against the changed Glenn Middleton and one for hand-play.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception and exceeded expectations in this upward trend again.
Their way of playing and their team have hardly changed since returning to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has wakened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on track throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the hosts’ team – and that’s something like a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (29 September) smiling faces and blue sky reigned when the heads of the government of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many followers came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also heard, condemning Erdogan’s policy as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and reproached by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
In a car crash, a cyclist was killed in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. of British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the physician took care of the man who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist died in an accident with a driver’s escape on Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday’s accident.
According to Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Road blockages and redirections for buses are set up, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in the event of unrest in a high-security prison for men.
The riots started on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin, Worcestershire, and continue.
Specialized "Tornado" officials have been summoned to end the unrest involving eight inmates who are limited to one wing.
Officials were treated on site for minor injuries to the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been employed to fix a still ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend a long time behind bars.”
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, police officers were sent to jail to address serious riots, in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flood-like floods (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that’s likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pull across the desert-shaped southwest and carry the risk of flood-like floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flood-like flooding on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, as well as southeastern California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday night and to move straight across Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close to Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was located as a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the border of Arizona.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with isolated rainfall of up to 15 centimeters in Arizona’s Mogollon rim.
In other areas of the desert-shaped southwest including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely to be possible and occasionally up to 10 centimeters in total.
For those who are not at risk of floods, the pink-related rainfall can be a blessing due to drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain will probably be useful in part as there is drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category.
First of all, the hurricane path means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, after which the hurricane will pull north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and thereby weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to meet land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation sums are expected to range from 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible,” said weather.com.
Subsequently, Rosa will pull northwards over Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the border to Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then pull upwards through Arizona to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening.
“The main danger is expected in connection with Rosa or its remains, very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-shaped southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
As a result of these rainfalls, life-threatening floods and water-driving debris are expected in the desert as well as earthslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Following the finding of a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured at Midsomer Norton's Excelsior Terrace area on Saturday around 4:00 a.m. in British summer time.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is “stable.”
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked everyone who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from “the wickedness, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the Democrats’ unscrupulous and unheard of tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “from the wickedness, the anger” of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh said in front of Congress on Thursday, rejecting the accusation he raised by Christine Blasey Ford of sexually harassing her decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also reported on his accusation at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding score in service to the public,” he told the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The president referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t stop, but in reality I stop,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the Democrats were seeing their mission to “make resistance and block it.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place at the latest in the Senate on Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, casualties rise
At least 384 people were killed, according to the authorities on Saturday, many of whom were flooded as giant waves hit the beaches due to a heavy earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a party on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when at darkness waves hit the beach up to six meters high, tearing many people to death, destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5.
“When the threat of the tsunami came up yesterday, people still followed their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell victim to him,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB civil protection agency at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it flooded cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were on the run from the tsunami climbing on trees and surviving, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Civil Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was shaken by further afterquakes.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in the massive earthquake on Friday matched the 200-fold energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown bigger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive,” stating that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
In the words of Nugrohos, communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the authorities were repeatedly criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official data.
Amateur shots posted on social media show a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street beneath him of the upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes a water wall crashes on the shore and floods buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately check the authenticity of the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami resulted in a massive power failure, which interrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need urgent food and other essential goods.
The city’s airport remains closed until October and has been reopened only for aid.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
The staff at World Vision from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but Doseba said they passed scenes of devastation on the way.
“They said they saw many destroyed houses,” he said.
The location is very bad.
Even when the aid groups began the hard task of starting disaster relief, some coined that expert foreign aid workers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are not possible until the place of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened so far.
“Right now, it’s still a catastrophe at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national catastrophe’, we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
While the second night since the earthquake and Friday tsunami dropped over Palu, friends and family members of the missing were hoping for them to see one of the miracles that lighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewage duct.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was stuck in rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the end of the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others at the Roa-Roa hotel were prisoners, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have to bear my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders made the round, WhatsApp desperately sent messages to the competition participants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages rather than blue checks only led to gray question marks.
“I think that means the news was not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a news release by the Newport Police on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee Thief, a Brink’s employee stole $26,750 when replenishing an ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to raise more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came behind the Brink’s employee and stole a bag full of money that was meant for the machine.
According to the press release, several witnesses saw suspects flee from the scene, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Individuals who have information on the identity of the suspect are asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his June released eighth album.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears in the show as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, canceled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of his current professional name, but it has religious meaning for West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said in a conversation about his album with radio moderator Big Boy this year.
“I am you, I am you, I am you.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, it became only ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects what we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West has previously worked, has already written his name with and without bindings and large letters.
Mexico’s AMLO vows not to deploy the military against the civilian population
Elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of bloody retaliation against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza “never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On 2 October 1968, soldiers fired to a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at which time leftist student movements were in the process of establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly aid to students and the opening of more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented last year its plan: The country intends to become #1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start given the fact that all other countries are so much behind the US. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling the financial resources could double the chances that the next major AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest ranked American Othello player, later as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee honoured previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wants to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state subsidies.
“Not China takes away the top academic powers, but companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired corypheries from universities to work on AI in recent years.
In Lee’s view, a changed US immigration policy could also be conducive to US AI efforts.
“I think that in the field of AI, people who have a doctorate should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
China’s State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan) in July 2017.
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations awarding funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, in which partners from industry and science are expected to be involved, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month that it will invest $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, US laws have not done anything for months regarding the establishment of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia's requests for admission to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim raises to the Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed the admission of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign raises doubts that voting will reach the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was, “Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the prize for inclusion in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would adhere to the result to make it crucial.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00.
However, voting was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters had voted.
"I'm here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in a referendum in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 on the change of the country’s name, which would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised head, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonian television station Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the vote must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City maneuvers through the entire Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defense in Manchester City’s 2:0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtaken several other defenders on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penal space to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame with his right shoe Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to drive Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before it slipped out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhine Neckar Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies game
Since the nationals have exited from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force a further commitment.
The ever-performing Scherzer, however, hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the Rockies, who have a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, for whom the playoffs are relevant.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw away because we know the atmosphere with the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I’d encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but are inclined, according to reports, to throw Scherzer in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th placement as a starter, practiced in Bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal day of rest on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has a 18-7 statistic this season, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation related to the Brett Kavanaugh, chosen by him for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not standing, but in reality I’m standing, that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this awful, awful radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power back by all means, you see the ugliness, the abomination.
They don’t care whom they hurt, whom they have to overtake to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, would see their mission to “make resistance and block it.”
“And you see that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate's Justice Committee, which triggered loud buhrufs among the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Did you let the document go outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for you -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer gives up all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to reproach me, this was little surprising.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who are told they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the reproach for having represented a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that “the meetings should all be involved and productive.”
For the most part, the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were exactly that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised "more friendly, more careful" policy has been forgotten for a long time, even if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that diverging views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the party’s head.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared similar political views were now expecting from me to make a reversal and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was regarding national security or the European single market.
“Whenever I speak publicly – no matter what I say – there is a chimpanzee on social media that calls for my vote, denounces the political center and says I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am feeling better than some of my colleagues, since the comments addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a daily flood of sexist or racist insults and never add small.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer allowing all opinions to apply, and with every motion for distrust and change of electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to put my head in and not express my opinion so clearly that I would have "no problems".
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally gave my classroom in the whole school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a municipal council as well as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a break from my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
I would only like to say to the supporters of Friday’s petition: Given the fact that the country is rushing toward a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I don’t understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I am not sending this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many threats or political thinking will not stop me from acting in your best interest in my opinion.

Ayr vs. Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result a little bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten unbeaten teams at the top of the table.
Ultimately, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better chance exploitation, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Recognition for Ayr, they’ve used their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr to the lead, but due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been exempt for the game by the Warriors, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot caught an unraveled attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penalty strike before scoring a hit right in the mid-time and then scoring an increased trial alone, so that it stood for Ayr's 17:5 break.
Melrose started the second half, however, well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was raised by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Then there was a longer interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was worn by the playing field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded his lead through a Climo-raised attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then Blair Macpherson, who served as Ayr's captain, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose ordered the additional man to pay by an unincreased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind the forward Ayr package from the penalty gate.
Climo increased, as almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flank player Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to move into the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open it the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol in front of the navy headquarters in La Paz.
A sea blue flag blows on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastal section lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still as alive as the desire to travel over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been in decades, as Bolivia is waiting for an International Court of Justice judgment to be passed on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will follow the ICJ judgment on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim, according to which Chile, after decades of sporadic talks, is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial struggle for his re-election next year, is also at stake in the ruling on Monday.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands is not authorized to approve of Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, the judgment of the IGH already appeared six months after the final plea, suggesting that the case was "uncomplicated".
Far from supporting Bolivia’s case, the last four years could also be a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has taken up the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
She suggested that Morales's warrior rhetoric suffocated all Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue their talks, but after these events it will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put an end to the 139-year-long disputes for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the theme of the sea as a political bridge.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The judgment is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never break down its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to put the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore into action.
His statements come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume the trapped nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri described the idea that further sanctions and US resistance against a declaration to end the Korean War would ever force the North on its knees, as a “brain spin.”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the declaration without Pyongyang first taking substantial disarmament steps.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about waiving an arsenal where the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris showcase the latest collections for huge headwear, which will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you don’t have to look anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized headwear for their 2019 summer collection that fascinated the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations over the runway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that squeezed the heads of the models.
Further oversized accessories were shown with jewels packed watermelons, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but these are not intended to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were sewn up with lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you’re lucky.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge headwears could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly “La Bomba”, the straw hat with 60 centimeters wide edge that all wear from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat hitting big waves on social media sent another great creation over the runway: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model wearing a swimsuit holding the bag.
The bast bag in red orange with bastfrances and a white leather ankle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has been so excited that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignorable.”
John Edward: language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding test results and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students from across Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the highest possible level of care for their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and coveted as elective subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can not only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that languages with the highest rates of existence are at the top of the independent school rankings.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages scored A at the higher exams.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of Mandarin students at higher exams scored A, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also scored A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as elective as STEM subjects (natural science, engineering, and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons employers mentioned for the problems of occupying vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more vacancies require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically get a lead over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
That’s why it’s important for today’s children to invest in language teaching now.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages in developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
Different languages are taught in all schools in Scotland.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught that are considered to be the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, a number of languages will always be available at independent schools with appropriately specialized teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future looks like.
At this point in time, in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
We have to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers' debut Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the waiting is soon over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the pre-season opening game.
However, how many minutes he will play is not yet clear.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play only a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his training plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need any pre-season games to prepare at this stage of my career,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign protests tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallyes planned for next week, including in well-minded places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote on confirming his election to the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans risk losing control over Congress.
When will Trump’s rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can follow Trump’s demonstration in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh nominated for the Supreme Court on allegations of sexual misconduct that have been carried out this week in a tense atmosphere, with the expected Senate vote on the confirmation remaining in suspension for up to a week while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main goal of this demonstration series is to support Republicans who have to face a difficult November election.
President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five rallyes will serve next week to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches,” a Trump spokesman who did not want to name his name told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, “Ohio and Pennsylvania followers could participate in the rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and report media from Pittsburgh.”
Saturday’s visit is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Western Virginian Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a politologist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows fighting readiness to maintain hope for individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four games on Saturday afternoon were possibly exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
As a sports concept, the vibrant pendulum of the momentum is a pure invention, but one that players truly believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
So where is the momentum in your opinion now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now they are four, so I think that means a little momentum for us,” Spieth said as he left the venue.
Europe is, of course, at the advantage and is four points ahead, while twelve more follow.
The Americans, however, feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each can score three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the decline to the green and goes forward with a good example.
The guttural screams of enthusiasm grew louder in the course of his round as he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both, after he and Thomas had gone back after two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match for her on the 15th hole, triggered a similar scream, suggesting that the American team is not yet out of play.
“I really have to kneel in and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
This is all that remains to the individual players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas and thus undoubtedly wrote the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" wasn't the only couple who didn't beat Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogey's on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the rear nine holes on Friday morning.
Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time at different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four-hero who played together with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Sweden into a clamp that they couldn’t nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the trouble.
The four and four pairs are so fascinating to look close by due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change quickly.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this four-round has also shown that the U.S. team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the U.S., had doubted.
Europe leads on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is at the forefront of Saturday’s fourths and fourths against the US with 10:6 and goes with a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The genius-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the difficulty-struggling Tiger Woods and thus scored four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bjørn, who wants to win back the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated in the fourths in the morning against the faulty-playing American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four-parts, the U.S. made more resistance and won two matches, but failed to catch up with the lag.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve individuals played Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were named Molliwood after a sensational weekend, only won four points as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized outstandingly and beat enchanted Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally made his brilliance glimmer, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four games as a partner of Henrik Stenson, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything went according to their ideas.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain in the fours and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team returned after having gone into the single with a four-point lag, but as title holder a draw is enough for Furyk's team to keep the trophy.
After only standing in second place for two days, it doesn’t look like they could start a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea’s Foreign Minister said on Saturday to the United Nations that continued sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that the country would under no circumstances unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea took “substantial measures out of good will” last year, for example stopping nuclear and rocket tests, destroying the nuclear test site and committing itself not to multiply nuclear weapons and technologies.
“But we don’t see a corresponding reaction from the US,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not unilaterally burst first.”
While Ri repeated trusted North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase-wise" denuclearization approach in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in so far as she did not reject one-sided denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a current U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim assured that he would work on “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes demands for a loosening of stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘first denuclearization’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and is even against the ‘declaration of the end of war’,” Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us on our knees is a brain sensation of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not address plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party in the denuclearization issue instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to a standstill.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was enormously different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea’s missiles on the mainland of the United States after “the evil” President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened with North Korea’s “complete destruction” last year, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in terms of disarmament steps, but said that there is still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea’s denuclearization.
Trump said on Wednesday that he did not have a time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must definitely continue vigorously until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry out Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made only to be accused hours later by North Korea of having made “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon to demolish a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the intended “corresponding measures” were security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough to sleep in one course
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep in primary education this year, which is a measure against the spreading macho culture of keeping themselves awake with caffeine and learning throughout the night.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is, in his opinion, the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to launch the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I not learning about it until now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
This year’s first course explained to the students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the University’s health services, said the university chose to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students will see the picture of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books, providing information on the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of sleep deficiency on sports performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
They are then encouraged to think about their daily routine using a map of the university site with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just like you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” said Czeisler.
The pride in pushing a “night layer” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deficiency a growing problem.
Ensuring enough sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain into hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler conceive the course. He had taken one of his courses in his first year at Harvard last year.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be encouraged to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler’s recommendation, students should make up a clock for sleeping time and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” that comes from electronic screens and LED lights and can take the circadian rhythm out of the clock, which leads to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Gor defeats Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's score for Steven Gerrard's disagreed team meant a 0:1 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first away victory since the 4:1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard to the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, so his team lags eight points behind the Hearts leading in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before the mid-time, and the low-inspiration Rangers seemed to have no chance of compensation.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian at the goal difference.
The Rangers are also threatening further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated because of a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which Ayr overcame and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained with the same eleven Livingston players who took a point from the Hearts last week, and should be thrilled how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston achieved more if they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after just two minutes when Menga's first defeat led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot aside.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of an hour of a clash between him and Steven Lawless he should have been punished, but Referee Steven Thomson did not allow the Colombian complaints to apply.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's 34th minute hits may not match the course of the game, it is not to be denied that they earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to handle a ball shot for a long time by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and picked Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard traded in the mid-time and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the wing player put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to block the ball.
However, Livingston continued to force the guests to play exactly the game they had, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving one long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the final phase, but McGregor stood well and stood down Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball from the corner.
Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton also demanded a penalty kick late after a match with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become a standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals.”
Evans: “Truly, I hear a crack!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention, which bears its name, continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” decayed cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy decayed cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine helps the immune system to detect decayed cells.
The method takes immune cells from a patient, which are changed in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a common protein of many cancers and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect decayed cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory in such a way that they can "see" the common protein HER2 of many cancers, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of leukemia type.
After his appearance at SNL, Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was dumped in the studio on Saturday Night Live after he widely praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to run as presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, “Ghost Town,” while wearing a make-America Great Again cap, he continued with a blasphemy against the Democrats, emphasizing again his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's judiciary committee on accusations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's chimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the release about West.
West also complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the stage because of his head cover.
“They bullied me behind the stage.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunk area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see the sinked area?” He said, “He’s going to put on my supermancape, because that means you can’t tell me what I have to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Try it with love.”
His remarks triggered buhrufs from the audience at least twice, and SNL contributors were embarrassed, Variety reported.
West had been hired late as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before.
West confused many with a lecture of the title "I Love It", in which he was disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous ghosts: THANK YOU HAVE ANTONED THE MASSE."
Talk show presenter Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I do NOT want to reward someone who, in my opinion, takes on an ideology harmful to my community and gives it to himself (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The Being Formally Known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course changed Prince, the late music legend, his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Accused of attempted murder in connection with stabbing injury at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Arbitration Court on Monday.
The allegations are reviewed by the prosecutor’s office.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword-swinging Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the Macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling strong in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believes something went wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who also participated in Game of Thrones, admitted that the solution to the problem was "very important".
“I personally find the question very important at the moment, what went wrong with masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught grown-up men about the problem we are observing now?”
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued, “What is congenital, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes the boy feel like he has to embody that particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the great questions of our time: How do we change this?
Something has clearly gone wrong with the young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that after the series ended next summer, he would not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones"; he had "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington will be seen in a re-edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best of "Game of Thrones" was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife in this show, so this is how I have preserved my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the transmission occurred in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is expected to be widespread.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men ultimately marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged general access to HIV drugs to address the problem, among other things.
Maxine Waters denied employees leaking GOP senator data, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the House of Representatives, denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the deputies' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations of “ultra-right-oriented” experts and websites were spread.
“Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published includes the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published during a hearing by a Senate committee on allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district against the Supreme Court candidates, Brett Kavanaugh.
The publication took place after the three senators interviewed Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were endangered by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This dementia is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temper to be a congressional member.
People who are accused of something they have not done should not be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who runs the midterm election to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are revealed," she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all the members of my staff."
Johnny English – You Live Only Three Times – Weak Spy Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to search for Brexit references in every British-coloured new film, which seems to apply to this revival of the action-comedy parody franchise "Johnny English", which began in 2003 with "Johnny English - The Spy Who Died" and returned to life in 2011 with "Johnny English - Now".
Will an ironic self-parody on the topic of how obviously stupid we are be a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glowing, grimass cutting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time, signaling more than anything else that he is a general comic creation for non-English-speaking cinema visitors.
Of course, he is again the clutched secret agent who bizarrely thinks he is cool and worldly, while in reality he consists of something Clouseau, a shot of Mr. Bean and a knock of this guy who contributed a single note to the title melody of “The Hour of the Winner” at the 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos behind travellers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television spots.
Johnny English’s last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly overlooked his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comic appears, but the humor seems fairly weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" film series like "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confidence comedy elements.
The humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy misfortunes are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s mute film gags in the role of Bean.
The ever-current premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spying network and revealed the identities of all British agents in operation, very much to the service agent’s disappointment, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and pressured figure who is already facing the complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Quasi Teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been uncovered and therefore she must take someone out of retirement.
This includes Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic facility, but is teaching undercover as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers an espionage academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to an emergency meeting to Whitehall and re-unified with his former heavily tested Kumpan Bough, who is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman from the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are always doing everything terriblely wrong in the secret service of His Majesty, are back in action while encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously undermined by a charismatic tech billionaire, the darkest Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque fun: dressed as a waiter, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, cause chaos as they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, though all the registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already discussed extensively on children’s television.
Very moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Cann’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan to work four days a week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that stipulates that the British work four days a week but are paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants business leaders to pass on the workers the savings achieved by the AI revolution in the form of an additional day off.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" with the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country for the benefit of workers.
The transition to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“A change will not take place overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort consistent with the Party’s approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and with the Party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to endorse such an idea; the Green Party already promised during the 2017 general election campaign to introduce a 4-day week.
However, the Labour Party is not currently supporting this approach as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week is not about party policy and it is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profit makers" in public utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not get their full share back because a Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to corporate boards and set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of private corporate equity to employees who earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in 60 Minutes news magazine on whether FBI investigation in Kavanaugh's case could change their minds
The FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question whether the authority’s findings could influence Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could unravel something that could ultimately change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told in the trial that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be cut in stone.
“My opinion is clear as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to burst a bomb,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has vehemently denied this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone who named her could not confirm it.”
It is now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been helped to reduce poverty during this festival?
This Saturday will take place in New York City the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival with an impressive line-up of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will be held this year for the seventh time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: fighting extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first held in 2012, is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project, which is part of an international stakeholder project that seeks to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in poverty reduction.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks, such as volunteering, communication with a world leader (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – fighting poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen will remain 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of putting a cool free concert in perspective a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that the project has achieved more than 19 million actions by its supporters since 2011 and has achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped encourage world leaders to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to supporting children in their optimal development, promised to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country with $35 million after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With support from the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition Ambassador, told the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions calling on Britain to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project The Power of Nutrition, which is intended to reach 5 million women and children and provides nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They replied, “There will be a long and exhausting journey with heights and lows.
But similar to the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because together we are stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year’s New York event, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as hosts.
US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to Washington Examine, Washington can resort to the Navy if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s deployment in Syria is an excuse for exploring new energy markets. Russia is currently operating at the invitation of the lawful government in these areas.
"I think the real reason for Russia's involvement in the Middle East is negotiating new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and ways to address this.
“The United States can jointly with the Navy ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as a “voice of electricity consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, finding that they are virtually identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, while referring to Russia as a “One Trick Pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as the Trump administration was about to expand exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
For this purpose, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, became Berlin the “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means to put pressure, and that consumers can choose suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has received counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has urged the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply,” said the Board of Directors of BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “examine” a 2020 presidential candidature, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “examine accurately” a presidential candidature after the interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidateship.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine accurately” a presidential candidature after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy,” she said.
Warren hasn’t taken a leaf to his mouth in their criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a survey published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% of voters supported such a candidature.
The survey showed more support for a candidature by former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent in favour of a potential candidature, and 48 percent opposed.
Other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a possible 2020 candidature include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden announced that he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin Speaks at Donald Trump's Rally on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Track Palin Suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, it’s all that other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers return with,” she told the audience at a ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an "elephant in space" and said about her son and other war veterans that they were coming back changed, that they were coming back browner, that they were coming back and wondering if there was such respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other military member gave the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support recourse to new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support an appeal to the new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who is questioning politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the grace-against-session suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been announced.
She said her partner “and his violent gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations facing major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy lifted a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The federal attorney general of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignorates decades of legislation at the state, state and international level.”
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged based on the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” the court’s expert statement stated.
Additionally, the lawyers argued that policies denying immigrants access to the country are adversely affecting the US economy, as immigrants might be more likely to act as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration courts no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“Asylum is available to anyone who leaves their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of policy.
It has never been the plan to dismantle all problems by granting asylum, even all serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of deaths in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son at a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.”
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed houses to gather their wetted possessions and property, while finding everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and hospital staff who were damaged by the 7.5-powered earthquake were totally overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was drawing up vertebral breaks and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Military Hospital of Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the ongoing heavy afterquakes.
With tears in his eyes he told how the heavy earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was stuck under the fallen walls,” he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then there was quiet.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they are in a safe place.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of tyranny with “propaganda advertisements”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement in an American daily newspaper announcing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the state capital Beijing of exploiting the U.S. press for proganda purposes.
U.S. Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an accusation that China denies.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. elections are consistent with US officials’ notice to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to post advertisements to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an extensive trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
Chinese retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states like Iowa that supported the Republican Party by Trump, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-standing governor of Iowa, who exports large-scale agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a Sunday’s Des Moines Register, now doubles this tyranny by making propaganda advertisements in its own free press in the United States.
“With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the proven tradition of free speech and the independent press in America by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing you will find only a limited number of votes against and you will not find a real reflection of the differences of opinions that the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media are firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans push voters before intermediate elections with debacle about Kavanaugh, warn observers
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, in the face of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming interim elections, which could be based on women in particular.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already reported that they are going on with a vote.
“Such things cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute push is enough for an FBI investigation to calm up angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what was yesterday, they don’t forget tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, first advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate hallway called "November is coming!" when Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold on to nominate Kavanaugh, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially with suburban voters and younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing their allegations of sexual assault on the Supreme Court candidate, observers suggested that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
“This situation is a mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the panel, the final vote or the review of Kavanaugh; it’s also about the way the Republicans dealt with it and how they dealt with it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to disagree about who to believe on the basis of Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, with a slightly larger share on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38% said they believe that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations raised by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford made a statement in front of the Senate’s Justice Committee last week that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had unveiled his genitals to her when they were at a party during their studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee stated that the intention behind Inrupt was “World Rule.”
“We need to be active now,” he said on the subject of startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow users to create their own personal online data storage or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other tools for the private and corporate area.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that the user can decide who can access which data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and data development.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers and a security platform acquired by IBM.
Earlier this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not discuss with Facebook and Google whether to make a comprehensive change in which their entire business models will be completely redesigned overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt is tasked with providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been significantly involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, wearer of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I, was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Lieutenant and Priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his involvement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren revealed a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, since the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the herohood for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through dense fog and under heavy fire of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he pushed forward to the fire line and with the "greatest courage" he moved the line forward, before running alone with a field weapon and turning off three of the military units.
Lieutenant Vann was shot by a German sniper on 4 October 1918; just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were something he could never meet, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a crown after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he was very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the courage of a real hero would become visible, especially through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the spectators in the UK were not badly astonished when Peppa Pig was suddenly seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to see the battle specifically.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to the trick movie character as a somewhat bad joke.
“As a result of a regulation by the government, this content is classified as non-teenage-free, so it had to be switched to a children’s program at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, when he was questioned about the broadcast.
"Peppa, the pig, right."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, announced that the company will process the schedule to take into account viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved already in the repeat game,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday with the spectators in the UK, and we will not resolve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But let's keep on.
The change was communicated quite a lot. It was quite messy and it wasn't always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed it to be a technical failure.
What wasn’t the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise, this won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we've tried to give fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is pretty regrettable.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “inferior” on sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part as a water jumper at various Olympics, says he grew up with the feeling of being inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old said he had realized that he was different from others only in high school.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victory at the Olympics was no longer so important to him.
The actual moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, is paused for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first broadcast, he said he once considered himself inferior in comparison to others, because the love of boys and girls was completely socially unacceptable.
He said, “To this day, feeling inferior to others and being different from the others is reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality to not disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The double bronze medal winner at the Olympics is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he commented on this issue because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that age difference has never been a topic.
He says that if you had to go through so much as a child and teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games at 14 for the first time and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes that his entire view has changed since then.
Even last year, everything would have turned around gold medals.
But for him, there are now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main win.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the near death, and one of the last things he asked about were the tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to be in the front line.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I just knew it was always my dream to dive in front of the local audience at the Olympics – that was madness,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by this. He listened to the song in advance of the Olympic Games and still took care of goose’s skin.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits on the replacement bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record in his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he must make a great effort not to make it a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being as usual at the center of the event, the five-time major winner spent his day encouraging others and working on his game, hoping to solve the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and therefore not an ideal cast for the narrow Le Golf National Golf Course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson meets perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has joined with Tommy Fleetwood, a newbie in these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans lay a four-point late start in the 12 single games, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely decisive.
Furyk was confident about Mickelson and couldn’t add much to it.
“He was fully aware of his role today, knocked me on the back and put his arm around me and said he’s ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has quite a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world’s best-known figures and has done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went now and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like anyone else.”
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup racetrack that never fully matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, had 20 defeats and reached seven halftimes, although Furyk announced that his presence alone enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to play some fun, and he’s a great man who’s popular with the whole team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulse.”
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that the lead may be over soon
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point ahead of the Americans, but reached only a little over the finish line and went to the lead with the smallest possible ahead, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“The idea remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just shortly,” said Bjørn (pictured on the photo) after seeing the 5–3 victory of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10–6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it’s not over.
Tomorrow's going right.
Just get in it and do the right thing.
The whole thing is not over until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s up against us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Joyful about the performance his players achieved on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never rush that.
Tomorrow will be a different calibre.
Tomorrow’s individual services are in the forefront and that’s a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested to the limits of your abilities as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he has to get the most out of himself too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent to Jim Furyk will make sure that his players perform better individually than in the team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big turns on the last day of the tournament, standing on the winner side in Brookline before standing on the side of the losers after Europe's "Wonder of Medinah".
“I remember every fucking word,” he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 major games tomorrow, but you would like to pull off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our team accordingly and send our guys out the way we feel, you know, we're trying to spell tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of winning the counter, he must compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
"I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest fregate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but according to local media, due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs, it will be delivered at the earliest next year.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the brand new fregates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that called on a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after the delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg Class, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Fregates of the Bremen Class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and sea target missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature are longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest fregates will not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
The ongoing delays, however, may cause the state-of-the-art warships to represent Germany as a sea power to be already outdated at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The fregate F125, pursued by the accident, came in the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after its extradition.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant “software and hardware faults” that would have made the new ship useless in a battle situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older fregates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is too heavy, causing performance losses and preventing the navy from carrying out upgrades in the future.
The 7000 tonnes weighing Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the crew’s training costs, became a problem.
Apparently, the costs rose to a breathtaking €3.1 billion, compared to the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest fregates are particularly significant in view of the recent warnings that Germany’s sea power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's military representative, confirmed that the navy would "exit the capable ships".
Bartels said the problem grew wider over time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been provided.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being conducted at a property in the Scottish Highlands to show how bats use the landscape in food searching.
It is hoped that the results will enable further insight into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future nature conservation activities.
The study conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will track dwarf and mosquito flag mice, as well as the brown long ear and water flag mice in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using portable detectors.
With a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the bats is determined and determines which species does what.
Subsequently, a map and a report of the habitat is created to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as meadow creation, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to loss of habitat.
Windshields and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly catchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or even attacks by home cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS responsible for maintaining more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the subject of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Property administrator David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there is a lot we don’t know about bats yet, so we are doing these works here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He emphasizes the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single nest place could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on site.
Bats are under protection and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: "We still have to learn a lot about bats and with many of our species we don't know what their populations are."
Ronaldo deny allegations of rape while his lawyers want to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying that people want to be “famous” by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The attacker of the National Team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence about the incident, according to The Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “fake news” only hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they have reported today: Fake News," said the five-time Ballon d’Or winner on the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror on the basis of accusations they described as “unlawful coverage of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player demanded compensation for “moral damages to an amount equal to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went into the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anally, according to documents submitted to Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy” who was dead to “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the two had sex, but said it was mutually agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographed her injuries in a hospital, but later entered into an extrajudicial agreement because she had “fear of retaliation” and was concerned to be “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the agreement as she is still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident, and this summer he switched to the Italian giant Juve in a $100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK would “eternally regret the loss of car manufacturers”
The United Kingdom would “eternally regret” losing its status as a world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, Economy Minister Greg Clark said.
He said it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the plant in Burnaston near Derby if Britain leaves the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the influence of delays at the border in a no-deal Brexit could lead to job loss.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that with an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March we will experience production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a harsh exit from the EU without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford after Brexit for a month.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain in a harsh Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing facility operates on a “just-in-time” basis, meaning the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to hold a stock at the Derbyshire factory that suffices for more than a day, the company explained why production needs to be stopped.
Clark explained that Theresa May’s Chequers plan on future relations with the EU “is precisely designed to avoid such border controls.”
“We need a deal, we want the best deal that will allow us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the previously very successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite union at the factory, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs will never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump’s planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed by another week,” while the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has examined oversight over the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s electoral interference, links between Trump’s advisors and Russia, and a possible impairment of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Minister of Justice and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secret recording his talks with Trump and the President’s dismissal using the 25th Constitution Supplement.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, as new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for next Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate’s judiciary committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump's press spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
On a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not been fixed yet, it might be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are currently going on with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters would probably contradict this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences was not an aversion to the TV reporter's "effect hatred," but admitted: "But I would not deny that they are effect hatred."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president makes more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him," she said, without providing accurate evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
“There will still be press conferences,” Sanders said, “but if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is far better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often, and you have seen that we have done this many times over the past few weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with attending dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, perhaps the president showed why it was when he made a running and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes about Brexit concerns to EU workers at the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health addresses people from the EU abroad who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and the desire to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Member of the Scottish Parliament, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraw from the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralized public service of Scotland.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the course of the summer, the UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued and decisions are expected this autumn.
However, the British government has also strengthened preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of how disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was undergone an emergency surgery, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, after a head injury, which he suffered in the 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the mid-term break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel provided Abercrombie with oxygen on the side line before being put on a wear and transported for further investigation.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details of the type or extent of the injury are known yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total number to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for buying real estate in the UK
Foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp tax for buying real estate in the UK in the future. The additional revenue is expected to benefit homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This step aims to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in stamp fee will affect anyone who does not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee when buying real estate in the UK, with the extra income to benefit homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp tax is imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and the additional revenue is to be paid to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and residential properties leased for rent, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the step to increase revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London real estate is purchased by investors outside of the UK, driving prices up and making it harder for first-time buyers to catch foot in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “ghost cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson voted for a reduction in stamp tax to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's "living shame."
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an eye-catching series of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a rental price limitation to the ban on evacuation without good reason.
He also wants to give city councillors more powers in the construction of new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream, according to which life should be improved from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for people not living in the UK as well as for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too far away for too many people and the indignity of homelessness remains a too big problem.”
Jack Ross: “My biggest goal is to manage Scotland”
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it’s his ‘greatest goal’ to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotlander enjoys the challenge of breathing new life to the club from the north-east of England, which is now in third place in the League One and missing three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I managed to get on the bench and that’s it,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But as a child I often saw Scotland playing with my father in Hampden and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I was successful in the management of the club.”
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities in this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only estimate my time here as a success if I brought the club back there.”
Ross can have a three-year management career, after a phase as Deputy Chief at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he is now feeling more comfortable than ever in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real division," he remembers when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe management was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds funny, as I didn’t feel bad, could live well of it and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
Playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things to go through every week.
I still do this through the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I do it. I’ve never felt so comfortable in my skin as an adult in my entire life.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, September 30, between 12:00 and 13:00 BST at Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is at 5:30 pm on Saturdays, according to a study.
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenue of Britain’s crisy pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Pub and cash businesses saw sales growth of 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the figures, explained: “Persistent sunshine and England’s ongoing participation in the World Cup longer than expected meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, where pubs saw sales increases of 2.8 percent.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with an emphasis on beverages by far showed the best performance, with an area-adjusted sales development that rose higher than it fell in restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, analyst for the recreational and catering industry RSM, said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at any worse time for operators of companies focusing on food and it remains to be seen whether the more temperate temperatures in August will provide the much needed breathing pause.”
Overall sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry revenue monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with combined revenues of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the recognized industry benchmark.

The message ignites fears that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of students said they owned a “main account” to show their parents.
One in five children, some just 11 years old, creates social media accounts that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “Fake Insta” accounts, a reference to the photo sharing website Instagram.
The message stimulates fears that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of students said they owned a clean “main account” that they could show their parents, but also owned private accounts.
One mother, who ran into the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who asked the other to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of the independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s annoying that so many teenagers are being induced to create online rooms where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes "vote of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Council of the Scottish Athletics Roofing Association.
Doyle is Scotland’s most frequently awarded athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, Britain and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from their election to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, calls himself a total of four Olympic gold medals and now often appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a transient circulation disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say no one can tell if or how far I'm going to recover.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
Advertising for milk pumps comparing mothers to cows creates excitement on the net
A milk pump manufacturer created excitement in the network with an advertising clip comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
In order to launch the "World's first noise-free portable milk pump", the manufacturer of consumer technology Elvie published a not seriously meant music video to emphasize the freedom that gives the pump breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn filled with hay with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see a dick at me" or "If you haven't noticed, these are not my breasts but my eggs."
The refrain continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
However, the advertising posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy on the net.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among spectators, many of whom say it is intact to the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Just like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their kids are taken away from them within a few days of birth,” it said in a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits subtly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Traceable traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don’t we use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another person added: “Such a non-reality advertising.”
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted she found the song "wonderful."
“I think that’s an ingenious idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When pumping out I felt exactly like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feel like “cows.”
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discrete pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps claim to feel like milk cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely noiseless, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a lactation bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a bold and provocative market launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on dairy pumps and all the associated challenges, while simultaneously introducing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump enables in an entertaining and understandable way.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared on the catwalk while using the product for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children were silently taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children interned is higher than ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively equal, among other things because tightened rhetoric and Trump administration measures have made it harder to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were even illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target for expulsion themselves when they sign up to accommodate a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal agencies announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and share that data with immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care for unaccompanied minors.
The authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either self-caregivers or members of a caregivers’ household reside illegally in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That’s why we will continue to follow these people,” Albence said.
In order to deal with the children’s cases faster, officials introduced new rules that, according to lodging staff, require some children to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days after the detention, which was the standard before.
Many will appear by video circuit rather than personally to stand before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the event of negative decisions, the person is deported quickly.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely, according to the lodging staff, as well as reports reported from the system in the past month, that they are being anxious and depressed, leading to violent outbreaks or attempted outbreaks.
Advocates say that these concerns are increased in a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there are signs that a child is having problems, which are easier to overlook due to the size.
They also explained that trauma, in which many of the children already suffer, could increase if they are taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on American, French and Turkish ‘occupy troops’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, declared that the foreign armed forces are illegally located on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and are "treated accordingly".
“You have to withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror” is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus "will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" by both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces, which are recruited against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were given and accused “some western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” preventing the refugees from returning home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable the return home,” he said.
“They are politizing a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats declared that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone at the last major rebel high quarter in Idlib represented the possibility of advancing political discussions.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad offensive of the Syrian armed forces supported by Russia to the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front allied with al-Qaeda, will be carried out.
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem cited the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, declaring that its work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-Election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, a dismissal or scandal would not end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidency of all time."
So far, there is no evidence that the spectators are tired of it.
Since 2014, CNN’s switch-on rates at the best broadcast time have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led to the entry rates with is 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people magically, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series “Designated Survivor” broadcast on ABC about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-fashioned comedy writer and author of the book Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘Because he’s making me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, Washington’s stories, unlike everything on television, can determine the future of the policy decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible unification of families and the health of the global economy.
Extinguishing is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, be an informed citizen, if one becomes aware of having watched six hours of an expert round about Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “Deep Background” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar-priced outdoor bomber jacket (according to the Washington Post, “a piece of clothing rich in self-assess”).
I will never see Super Mario again with the same eyes.
“Part of what he’s doing feels like a reality show he’s introducing to every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive officer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the “The Three from the Deposit House” series, about Trump’s rotating occupation and daily actions (a dispute with the NFL football league breaking from the fence, Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you won't come with you anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he hid in and watched MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t get rid of the screen, not when judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate’s judiciary committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all these crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’”
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donation funds flood the closest races for seats in Congress in the interim elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th electoral district is flooded by donation funds, thanks to the newly drawn limits of the electoral districts, which led to two officers standing in the race for the same seat.
The recently newly drawn suburb district in Pittsburgh has made Democrat Conor Lamb compete, who won his seat in another district in the wake of a special election last spring.
Lamb competes against another official, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were contravened the constitution and manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a hit-sharing of campaign financing between the parties’ major financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was acknowledged in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in a much-noted special election in March around the state's 18th election district.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican, and Trump won 20 percentage points ahead there.
Political experts give the Democrats light leadership.
The U.S. reviewed El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic aid, were considered.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar assembly last year and represented a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the US.
However, in mid-September senior government officials made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus effectively ending the consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to serve as a spokesman at the conference scheduled for mid-October to signal the importance of the assembly’s government, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further harsh communications or sanctions from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton rejected a comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal meetings on the condition of anonymity.
Their comments were reaffirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be the report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible judiciary impairment, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now also reportedly investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in his attack on the American elections.
If the congressional majority changed, Trump would face an organ that would force him to account, precisely at the time he passed it, to stand before the voters again; and possibly before a jury.
That’s a lot of ‘if’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will influence how long the fight will last.
In 1938 German officers were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed one way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Devil’s kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he proposed secretly recording the president and speculated that he was unsuitable for the office.
Rosenstein denied the New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and falsehood in office?
And most importantly, will we vote for a Congress that will force Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we will have a long winter ahead.
But I don’t think we will fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this heritage?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the match against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remise against Villareal in Spain earlier this month will place them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans was unable to appear up to 2-2 equal to Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a leapboard for larger ones.
“This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make something out of it and we drove home with one point.
Maybe we could still have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we struggled in the second half and then we were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we will get three points, but this will be a tough game because they made a good result in the last game, but I’m sure we can do this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to lead the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Life Insurance Division at Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be an important factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they own the money.
Develop your legal documents: Refer to last-minute disputes.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you entrust a familiar person to monitor your medical care and make sure the healthcare professionals meet your wishes if you are unable to express them yourself.
Also consider an authority for your finances.
You choose a familiar person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your invoices are paid if you should not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that play a role. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is medication treatment?”
Who cares about the dog?
Have you finished this plan.”
Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home with friends after work.
The victim, a man in the forties, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly, and hand.
Officials described the shootings that occurred at about 02:30 British time as “an arbitrary act.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said.
Due to the failed communication systems, aid forces were unable to obtain information from the government district of Donggala, an area north of Palu, located closer to the epicentre of the earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Donggala is a government district that stretches in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income in the Central Sulawesi economy, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been the victims of earthquakes and tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Civil Protection Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996, in which nine people died.
Indonesia lies on the seismic Pacific fire ring, and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26, which struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-size earthquake shook southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast, causing nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-powered earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-size earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes struck Indonesia’s tourist-popular island of Lombok, causing more than 500 deaths, especially on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for allegations of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidate for the post of Vice President, was arrested on accusations of injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, hindering reporting of domestic violence and resistance to state violence, according to a report released by Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a acquaintance when they wanted to tell the police.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility, according to KTUU, and a deposit of $500 has been charged.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he, when asked about his plea, responded with “Not guilty, quite sure,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three class A violations, which can be punished with up to a year’s imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B violation, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being discussed in the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, impediment to reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she returned her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor's Office Demands Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The New York Federal Prosecutor’s Office demands the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack that cost eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a leased pick-up from the Home Depot chain for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he rushed on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, while crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "targetfully" killed the eight ovens and "consciously" inflicted serious bodily injuries, as stated in the memorandum of intention for the death penalty claim filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Inquiry Court of Saipov filed a 22-point indictment that includes eight charges of murder against the background of organized crime, which are normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as an indictment of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demands "basic planning and intent," according to the prosecutors, which described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as "abhorrent, cruel and corrupt."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted harm, pain and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal offence in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were found guilty of conspiracy two years before committing spying for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, gave birth in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, according to court documents.
He said before investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, the indictment said.
He also called for the ISIS flag to be hang in his hospital room, according to police.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal defensors representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a conviction in exchange for a life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only extend the trauma that all stakeholders suffer,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the indictment not to demand the death penalty.
MEP of the Conservative Party calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest campaign at the Tories Conference.
The former Ukip party leader stated that politicians “must feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a member of the party of Theresa May suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative rear-banker Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already outside” if Farage was Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciliating her deeply disputed party has been exacerbated by participating in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble keeping her compromise plan on track despite attacks by Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, it should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between their package and the “chaos”.
Bone explained at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that “checks on the garbage” belong.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed as a peer and that he should have been given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for it, we would be out,” he said.
Wellingborough’s deputy added, “I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: “We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Brexit advocate of the conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, declaring to reporters, “I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure we are elected.
Please give up chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp message to May, she continued, “Premiers keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage stated in an address that politicians must “feel pressure” if they are just about to cheat on the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat on Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘You don’t get away with it.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he said, “I want you to feel the pressure of our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, which has helped us to win the referendum and will never come to rest unless we are an independent, self-managing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour demonstration in the city centre.
A few activists pivoted banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party that was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a peer of the Labour Party, mocked the Tories who had security issues with a party app when opening the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, like all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, are present for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ presidential candidature
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November elections, she will "examine the presidential candidature carefully."
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a pronounced critic of President Donald Trump, is currently racing for re-election to the Senate against Massachusetts Republican MP Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign team.
She was the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump’s appointment.
One of the attendees asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after death shot on LSU player Sims
The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of the deadly shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen on the shots.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head and died as a result of this injury,” according to the Sports Media Portal 247sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his boyfriend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene and possessing a weapon and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter-sized Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 startups last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches World Championship after his team has given him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in the qualifying before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes stable orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas managed to get a good start and it was almost like showing Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and brought Hamilton into traffic at the end of the driver’s field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a round later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overcame him after a brief wheel-to-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari driver resistantly freed the inside to endure after two moves to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the rear seats of the field and was seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, as he stopped at his tyres to quickly finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day as Valtteri brought outstanding performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me pass.
The team has done an excellent job to achieve a double victory," Hamilton said.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at an election campaign that insisted she did not pass on to the press the letter by Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accuses the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford’s statement did not directly address the Senate’s Justice Committee, but commented that the events in the Senate show that people are “common, evil, and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and evil and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at the leaks and then you say, ‘Oh, that wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Remember your answer... Publish the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Okay, just a moment, please.
Do we have it... No, we didn’t publish it,” he added by imitating the senator’s voice.
Feinstein played the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and it was released in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told The Hill.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy.”
Her dementia seemed not to come well with the president, who said at the campaign event on Saturday evening: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his ongoing defense of the judge candidate, who is accused of sexual assault by three women, claimed that the Democrats would use the accusations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to recover power by all means.
You see the evil, the wickedness, they don’t care who they hurt when they let them fall under the wheels to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars restored their defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by a 5:3 victory in the Dundee back game on Saturday.
The Giants went early with two goals in the lead, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought compensation for the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
François Bouchard matched Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third loss in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening goal took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped to his compensation gate after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants lead before the mid-time break when he scored his second goal of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again matched with a power-play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, Nielsen then secured his team with a fifth goal after almost half of the second half.
The Giants, who now lost four of their last five games, will play at home at Milton Keynes Stadium next Friday.
Air Force Controller died after assuring hundreds of people escaped the earthquake in an airplane
A flight controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to have a plane with hundreds of people on board launch safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after Sulawesi Island was shaken by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong afterquakes are still felt in the region and many people are trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the heavily fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the tower as he thought he was crashing.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Indonesia’s aviation security service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News said.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message,” he added.
At the same time, the authorities are concerned that the number of deaths could rise to several thousands, the country’s civil protection authority said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is likely to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached,” said official Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
“Supermarkets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “The Indonesian Red Cross is hurrying to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
“When you’re ready?” CNN said.
Indonesia has already been shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini reports disappearance after plane crash in Micronesia
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they couldn’t say anything about a passenger’s stay until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or his nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday but in stable condition.
The cause and accuracy of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both declared that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the landing track.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying beyond the landing track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wave through deep hip water to the emergency outlets on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were in panic and screaming and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve a pitch rushed to help with an inflatable boat to bring people to the coast before the plane sank to about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst rebuilds the course of the night when a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded its evidence on Saturday in the re-trial of a case in which a man was accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett served for hours as an expert on information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he rebuilt the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night using cell phone calls.
Rowlett said he had received position data from various cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of his death, which contradicts his previous statements, the newspaper Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday and said he had not been to the town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had said the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers two weeks at the time of her death.
But cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis loosed their messages, calls, and contact information from his phone some time after Chamber's death.
“He removed them from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will subsequently go before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to their roots and back to socially conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a renaissance in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
New York nurse sues couple for dismissal after "racist" SMS
A New York nurse sues a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misguided message from her mother complaining she was “still a black woman.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the legal dispute with a “extortion.”
The two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new mother of the day, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEIN, NOT BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognizing her Fauxpas, the “embarrassingly touched” Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American mother had done a bad job and expected her instead to be a Philippine woman, the New York Post said.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for the $350 per day she was supposed to take over six months for the job she had originally booked for, but without contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do that,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know that this is discrimination.”
The couple rejected the accusations of racism, arguing that the dismissal was the reasonable step because they feared Maurice after insulting them could no longer be trusted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco, wife, told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone who was rude to you, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to a “extortion” and stated that his wife is expecting a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation.”
“Do you want to deal with such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the legal dispute continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers would not identify with a speaking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
Today, it’s very funny with our knowledge of Paddington’s huge success today.”
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, would not have had any problem with it if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the release after his death last year was "bitter sweet."
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she described as a "very important family member."
“He was a very quiet man and did not boast,” said Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having a child doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself to be responsible for his success.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chances,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the phone call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart on the pump slowly sounded off and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything drove down.
I couldn’t do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to get together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers who did not get anything of what she was going through, went on board the plane.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their loved ones due to suicide are trying to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers for consulting offices.
Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten up a room.”
However, he quit his job before his death, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, “I always fear that this could have a consequence.”
Davis designed the maps to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids unpacked their gifts, he didn't see them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a big trauma for her, but that they had to go through it: "It's tearing a huge hole into the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Swift as the FBI Starts Investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like this that he asked for, that is, a timely and limited investigation, then perhaps we could get a little consensus," said Flake on Saturday, fearing that the committee would "break apart" in the political stalemate.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want FBI investigation?
Their reluctance can be attributed to the timing alone.
The interim elections on November 6 are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans were to do badly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush seized the phone hearer to call on senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush at the White House and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently includes 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can bring at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide on equal votes and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overflowers ‘sink’ under Kim
The number of North Korean passengers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean politician said.
Park Byeong-sug, who relies on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that 1,127 overriders were registered last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices for human smugglers, the main factors.
Pyongyang did not speak publicly about this.
The overwhelming majority of Northern overflowers are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China views the overruns as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often brings them back with violence.
The relations between the north and the south, which are still in the state of war from a technical point of view, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks about the closed denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, in which they generally agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions of lack of progress.
“Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves first unilaterally,” Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not suitable for office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was characteristically inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said on her response to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate’s judiciary committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all accusations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes he almost screamed and was about to break out in tears as he talked about his family and high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him a “grotesco and coordinated murder” organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton’s lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes that Kavanaugh’s statement proves that he can’t serve in the Supreme Court because it shows that he is biased against Democrats.
"I believe that he declared himself inappropriate with these statements and the way in which he moved over the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if he was to be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judge position,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Appeals Court in Washington D.C.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, as he is regarded as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh excluded questions about whether he would revise certain Supreme Court decisions.
“We don’t need a hysterical, biased person now who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful.’”
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overboiling anger and she doesn’t get it out without crying.
“We’re crying when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was crying when she got angry but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, say to the person she said, ‘You may think you’re sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I found it brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I was crying because of an indescribable anger and was crying by an older woman, a undercooled manager who I was always a bit afraid of, packed at the collar and pulled into a staircase.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re stinking.
They believe you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves because they believe you have gone into the substance.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship named Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidature, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of presidential candidature himself.
“That wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the election campaign was already advanced, she was behind the fundraising and swore not to run if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported her campaign with $250.
“Do you think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and direct address voters instead of delegates, and the anger over sexism, so overwhelmed that she stood near tears.
“You could have assumed that I had a nervous collapse,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the cloth manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She was crying?"
Why Beijing Could Benefit From US-China Trade War
The opening salves of the U.S.-China trade war were drowsy. Although the battle is not over, Beijing could benefit from a trench between the countries in the long run, my experts say.
President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year as he imposed penal duties on important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week took place with new duties on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing pushed back every time in the same way and recently raised penalty tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China swore to respond to any US measure and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon stumble.
Moving Washington to deflect would mean giving in, but a public deflect against the US would be too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision could create conditions for economic turmoil in either Washington or Beijing in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously noticed,” says Abigail Grace, a scientist who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is ‘ready’ for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister said.
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help for the reconstruction of the country devastated by the over seven-year war.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the circumstances in the country are improving.
“Today the situation is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government is rebuilt the territories destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All conditions are now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed help in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
He emphasized, however, that it would not accept conditions-bound assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a finish score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown back after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had trouble over much of the tournament, sinked his departure on the 16th railway (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europa, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy to win back the cup.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” said Garcia after the European victory.
He extends the torch further to his fellow countryman John Rahm, who won in individual matches against the American Gulf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1.
“I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods I’ve watched on television since I was a child,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup score of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest players of all time who has won 14 important titles and is surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The US team had trouble finding the fairways throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who made high-profile performances throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance from his team: “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We didn't make anything of it.
Hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed well.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going to look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull out the hat.
We were defeated.”
Update on Red Tide: Concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota decrease
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, in the areas of the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, more gap flowering conditions are recorded, indicating decreasing concentrations.
A red algae flower stretches over about 130 miles of coastline from the north of Pinellas to the south of the district of Lee.
