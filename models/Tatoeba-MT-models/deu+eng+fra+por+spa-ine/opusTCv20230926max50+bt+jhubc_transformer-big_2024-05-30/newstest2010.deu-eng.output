Barack Obama wins fourth Nobel Peace Prize
President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a cheque of $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
He first visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential pair planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony where Obama takes the prestige award.
He receives this as the fourth president of the United States, but only as the third who receives the prize directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes over the prize.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president currently waging war in two countries.
He intensified his war efforts a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gol medal, diploma and cheque of ten million Swedish krones (about 24 million Czech krones).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event program then provides for a banquet with the president and his wife, at which, besides the king and queen of Norway, the prime minister and 250 other invited guests will also be present.
Obama was very reluctant to the price from the beginning.
He said, for example, that he felt that he didn’t earn the prize entirely.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all who seek the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he pointed out that for him this is "invitation to act".
Nature conservationists accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the civic association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmailing.
In several cases he filed appeals last year against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said theLeitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Naturschutzgemeinschaft is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in prison and is threatened with a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting garbage containers in Brno do not smell well
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the southern Moravian towns you can find the sorting trash containers again step by step.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage bins.
I do not want to say that waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors are insufficiently concerned with this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Urwald League, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers here, but above all because of the number of waste containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a basket?
This is art, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian square opposite the struck goose.
Mr Onderka should not be annoyed by his colleagues, but this is too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is not honey sweeping in other parts, either.
All my friends prefer not to sort the waste at all.
From laziness.
It is too far to the trash bins.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on Konicova street I saw no colour waste tones in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place when driving the tram.
The garbage was almost over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics are likely to leave the Brno socialists cold.
They’d rather buy the city an ice hockey liga that makes us shame all over the Republic rather than buying a few more trash bins and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness allowance
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s views, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and construction savings.
But neither for the interest rates of public debt nor for international court disputes.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the wage increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow additional money for sensitive spending, retirement pensions or sickness benefits. "This is just a postponement of problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
Of the loans, ever higher interest rates are paid, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to take, the state cash is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state operation are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
To get the pensions or sickness benefits from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people don’t have to be afraid to get that money.
But at the price that the state is indebted even more - next year it will not only miss 163 billion in the state cash, but far more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, debt will rise faster and faster, and along with it the costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its regional benefit package.
Due to the flow of money in favor of some electoral groups, next year there will also be a lack of five billion dollars for the expansion of highways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly reduced.
At the very highest, which is also not free.
This means delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, the creation of money in Europe is also at risk, warns the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it salomonically triggers the outflow of money - it attacks the CEZ shareholders in whom the state owns the majority, and from whom the money is then distributed into the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never secure and it is in no way an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion dollars were added to the budget of CEZ.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit on the snow increases by 5.7 percent GDP.
But this does not end the carnival of the changes.
Nearly three billion dollars have decreased the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for court litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the government can cope with that money is not sure.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, we must pay it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister then has to save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the two-billion-dollar project "Staatskasse", which is intended to enable on-line monitoring what the individual authorities are spending the money on.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would come in this case, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
Just press one button, and from Windows Mobile will switch Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the possibility that the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses primarily on developing virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced the two-operating system smartphone test pattern to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, which simultaneously run the aforementioned systems Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is fully underway.
The company VMware is now working with the European and American operators on the virtualization of smartphones and to the customer the devices are expected to come within 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments hotel owners
Snowless slopes worry not only the giant mountain inhabitants.
The lack of snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That’s why you can still have free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but in the meantime they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they ask immediately if we think this year’s Christmas will be on snow or “on the moat,” the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, said.
Anyone who wants the New Year’s Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to his ideas should no longer hesitate to order.
If you prefer saving and the quality of your stay is only second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindlemühle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year’s Eve.
I think they’ll be trying to sell them for a while, but then they’ll have to give up, too, and respond to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly fade, appreciated Jandura.
The travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
We are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not sold out yet.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year’s Eve on Giant Mountains, but there are fewer places available here.
Good sales are also found for the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People wait to see if snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the slopes be snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, Schiefert says.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, it succeeds in occupying the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about 5% better than last year.
On New Year’s Eve and Christmas we only have a few rooms left.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
For the New Year’s Eve stays, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the Central Park in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by January, for which we are already occupied at about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now February, but the moment the snow comes, surely the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains also rises, said the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
Meanwhile, the hotel owners of the Giant Mountains are waiting for a greater snow shave.
On Thursday it should cool and if there is rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But afterwards a warming is expected to come again, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is the Mother of Wisdom
It is almost funny with what student enthusiasm Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy in the Afghanistan question, which he himself thought was the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it over the copy paper from the Busch-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the words “as in Iraq” in the text himself several times, he has even used the name of the January 2007 Bush Declaration as the name of his own declaration: “New Forward Way” without hesitating.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea – sending fresh troop quotas into the Iraq plagued by the civil war – as “irresponsible and in its consequences a catastrophic decision.”
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on military recommendations was the only possible and very successful insofar as there is no talk at all about Iraq in the news today.
Bush’s reputation was not improved because he objectively left his successor a much more than expected starting situation.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
The military once again asked him to increase the troop quota, especially the chief commander of Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the habits of subordination heavily criticized the magical shooter in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, so he cheated the general for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe he has made a promise for another 5,000, even though he originally expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic of the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process in three years, and the entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even despite the brotherhood war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can rely on and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to change their minds every day.
The political institutions, even though they were formally correctly established, remain only fake buildings behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the unclearness of the conditions that further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
The establishment of a “acting state”, which is the minimalist aim of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy amazed by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated and is now on the verge of the explosion.
It is believed that the little soldiers who have erupted into the cry of war over the "Early Home" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of the troops is purely irresponsibility, because the Taliban will accept it as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans’ willingness to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is slowing down.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukusch mountain suburb.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not affect Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem can be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period in which America moves to Obama to withdraw winners from Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three more years until the presidential election, and so there is enough time for him to take a different strategy if it proves to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive any cash bonuses this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers gets shares instead of money, but you can only sell them in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs stands at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, said former banker of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made itself the target of criticism after putting aside nearly $17 billion in premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year will likely exceed $20 billion, according to Reuters.
The high bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the beginning of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bonuses of bankers who exceed 25,000 pounds once with a 50 percent tax.
France is preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all areas except in physics.
Today in Stockholm, five record women took over this year’s Nobel Prizes from the hands of the Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf in the category of professionals and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and their fellow counterpart Jack Szostak have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for chromosonic research.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for enlightenment of the ribosome structure and function.
The latest laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for fibre optic research and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has the diploma, Nobel Medal and certificate of acquisition of the Money Prize.
It is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the money price is divided between them.
Traditionally, US President Barack Obama received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech he recognized the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and is at the top of the country that wages two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In respect of his policies, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fight for world peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, on Friday early, who is thinking about his remaining in the government because he disagrees with the execution of the state budget for next year in the form that was released by the Parliamentary Assembly on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps Janota’s remaining in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed of the meeting.
Janota is planning to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion Crowns.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday the Left Party’s proposals for money circulation were voted and the money for state officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers was increased.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the Right Party on the other, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen, because of which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer-Officer Cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as approved by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of austerity measures enforced by the Fischer government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, is meant to end public debt.
Klaus, who can, but doesn’t have to, sign the law on the state budget, today at the breakfast discussion with the entrepreneurs, explained that politicians have neglected the “serious problem” that represents the “unsustainable deficit” of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could rely on a wider consensus between political parties.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolanek said the budget is horrible, and the government should weigh its continued existence.
ODS Chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of official cabinet with support from the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong statements."
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the state deficit was terrible, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeded 200 billion crowns.
Even on Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows much of the world, of whose struggle and victories despite some criticism that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, race conditions and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his lifetime the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by Ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could play him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", has already represented the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which it has finally become a slave holder, a fictional US president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely anyone who is still alive and as important to many people as Manda.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players, who are among the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team moves up to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked on it for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak the way he was.
The actor said if he and the world politicians were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transferred, and I felt like I know what you feel, he said.
It’s important for me to have become another person.
Matt Damon represents François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players outweighed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I ringed the doorbell that it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, ‘I look much bigger in the movie.’
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also talks about prospects for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summarized his review in the following words: "This was a very good story, a very well performed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76% positive reviews.
Light secret about Norway solved: Russians tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense acknowledged yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was again unsuccessful and the missile called the type "Bulava", originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on site in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
In most cases, Bulava has not started at all or has been damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers already write about "Bulava" as about a "missile that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the missile occurred.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" started from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows firing from the submarine.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over the north route was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has retained itself, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile did not fall out and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even though no test started without errors, only six out of thirteen of the Defence Ministry’s leadership considers it to be unsuccessful.
The nearly fifty percent success therefore fulfills the generality with optimism and thus continues to be claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersound nuclear explosive heads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder is helping his team CSKA Moscow in the midst, and is likely to compete already in Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who finished his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergey Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is unclear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only affect one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morality of other players, co-player Nemcinov mentioned.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice sheet, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary striker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford at fifty-one years and was able to benefit 15 hits and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union dress, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championship titles and also triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Cup.
In the second part of his career he also collected successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup over his head twice in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave up on trade unions. All overtime will be lifted
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union to lift all overtime.
Due to frequently arranged overtime, the union announced its strike readiness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman for the Hyundai automotive factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade union members on a Saturday layer this week.
We must not give up our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19th, volunteer overtime was proposed for the reason that two layers of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work the Saturday layer.
The staff will also receive it afterwards for the Saturday class of November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take a replacement vacation on December 28th and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday class will be paid the ticket and lunch.
Given that the overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided with immediate effect yesterday afternoon on the cancellation of all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, the employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work practically 2 overtime every day after the eight-hour class.
Once the agreement is signed, the unions will revoke their willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade union members are expected to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchar said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are willing to lift the strike readiness.
The situation in the automotive factory increased last week, Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, held that employees must spend overtime to meet the automotive supply requirements.
The unionists also demanded in their Monday strike preparedness proclamation that employees who stopped production on Wednesday would not be subjected to sanctions.
In the field of overtime, trade unions are calling for overtime to be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year they are calling for the payout of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The series production was launched at the company in November last year.
By September, around 80,000 vehicles were produced here, and the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also acts on HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that are already resistant to medications.
This fact prevails against the disadvantage that the compound does not work as strongly on usual virus variants as one of the medicines already existing.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
However, patients can prolong their life and prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
However, their intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus propagation also leads to the development of resistant viruses, against which no longer drugs are effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the CR Academy of Sciences, the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens up the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalocarborans act on the protein that is responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus propagation in other ways than all medicines used today, which is why they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new "improved" compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Home-based and resistant virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus split caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would be created.
When we turn off HIV protease, we also turn off the propagation of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press report issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CR Academy of Sciences.
In the paper published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe entire series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further changed.
A little weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reagent glass, including against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the medicinal products used in the clinic, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicinal products used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its additional properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research focused on the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlina Rezacova, Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molemic Genetics.
Argument about budget. ODS started on Fischer, he resists
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as “grey” and Jan Fischer’s government should consider its continued existence.
The statement of the SDG called the Prime Minister “strong statements.”
It is supposed to be time for analysis.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Necas said the concept of the Official Cabinet with support from the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the SDG and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with link party amendments proposed over 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased funds for state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has fulfilled the wish of the government, because even the amended budget is only a less poor variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and senselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has said that the government is still judging the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with his resignation in the event that the amendments were accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota signed up with the Premier for Monday after the government business.
He said he was considering his remaining office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the negotiation of the budget.
To what extent Fischer is speaking for the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-raising laws, such as those concerning sickness and pensions or the Service Act.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not make a mistake
This is the business of the Prime Minister and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did not make any mistakes, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are deputy people who are in the position of TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to waive the fight against the public finance deficit height, "it is completely logical and correct that he relies on the left majority that is currently in parliament".
Then he can’t supposedly count on the support and tolerance of the citizen Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and if it's going to be current, then I'll deal with it," Minister of Defense Martin Bartak, nominated by the Democrats, told journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon to the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister’s request.
At the same time, Necas stressed that the SDG would likely vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in parliament if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the deputies of the citizen Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not appear as orphans, we are not young children, so he responded to the question whether the SDG was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize that my voice would be missing.
As soon as I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about Bolshevikizing Parliament and destroying everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
The Czech Railway will terminate or restrict some less exhausted local and speed trains as of December 13, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic scope will be reduced by 2% from the date the new schedule is valid compared to today.
Most fares incl. base and customer fares are not changed.
Several connection options to the capital, for example, are available to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The fast train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less quick trains will also be used on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, with direct connections from Prague to Letohrad being reduced.
The largest reduction plans the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, can look forward to an increase in Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis are also picked up and the operation of some quick trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis is reduced to a few days a week.
Among the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice need to switch to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth road of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Railway Station.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel within two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava since December 13.
This year’s regional railway bill: 200 million increase
The rapid trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, overall the railway receives four billion crowns to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, just like this year. The local trains supply the districts, overall they pay eight billion crowns next year, with the state raising three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains and speed trains, the railway has re-entered a ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, and perhaps that’s why it didn’t use the price increase on the vast majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made with one-day CD Net and cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the route, so far it was uniform for travelling between any district towns and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militants arrested more than 50 people, the children were released.
Today, in the south of the Philippines, militants kidnapped 75 people, including some elementary students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which originally informed only about 65 kidnapped persons.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
It was kidnapped in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to deliver the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), which is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, police persecuted the kidnapper for the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, state law was imposed over the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23rd massacre, which was associated with the election to the renewed government office, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Phillippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, however, they reopened peace negotiations with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be featured in American cinemas "Invictus: The Unbeaten", which includes a part of the life story of former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has received Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The second role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has received Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, reactions from critics and the public will also be loud.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sachar Prize, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to cinemas at a time when South Africa on the one hand culminates in the preparations for the World Championship, while at the same time the media shaking the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants on the part of the ruling black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations against the casting of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have been well prepared for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that I could, as one says, receive his energy, he performed in an interview after the film’s festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if with this film we can remember Mandela’s personality and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the Dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book template of British writer John Carlin, freely translated ‘In the role of the enemy’: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African human rights defender during his first presidential election period.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two races and mutually delimited populations from year to day, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays the World Cup in the South African National Rugby Dress, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the grass in the dress, which is almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested huge ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white public, thus gaining recognition from the white population.
Perhaps the rugby championship will bring people together in turn to form a single people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the situation in South Africa is improving, that will only show.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as for example in the recent interview for LN the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to the UK.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
Transformers in the Louny area burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning on the transformer of the company Ceps in the switching system at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman for the district firefighters, Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Initially, the fire department wanted to burn the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water-foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the havaries were not endangered, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the line system.
The damage has been estimated at several 10 million crowns, more accurately the damage will be calculated only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened to the company Ceps, these mistakes are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokesperson of the company CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the fire of the trafo station was not affected the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical pipes.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred into a distribution system and line line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura files a criminal charge for libel against three heads of the CSSD.
The student agency owner, Radim Jancura, today files criminal charges for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company’s efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three ladders attack us and say that we are taking out the raisins, we only submitted the offer over the scope as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railway because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
So we have nothing but to defend ourselves.
Due to this defamation by the Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be the continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves as a free advertising for his company as well as for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I ask for other leaders to do so.
I assume that in this matter it will also become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional internal railways and uses liarous and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio newspaper that he wants to interrupt the campaign after Christmas, and continue it after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional railway transport with the Czech railway and did not tender for the order at a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to criticism of rail traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was also threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up that we could also lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not tell his name, Jancura told the radio newspaper today.
Vaccination against pneumococcus free and voluntary
Infection against pneumococcus will change the usual as of January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But already now votes are reported that the obligation vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free vaccination against pneumococci culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that the health insurances must pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New Vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
Beginning in January, children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococci born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that you have not yet received a dose of vaccine.
Those who have started vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further vaccination themselves.
The first dose of the vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th months of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcus.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required to vaccinate the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year for vaccination doses.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children’s land vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococks cause middle ear otitis, but also serious infections including brain skin otitis and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections have caused us to die in hospitals a year of up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcus has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a duty in the future.
As of January, it will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
That duty vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the Nahlas civic association, Rudolf Kalovsky.
Its association already promotes pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The professionals at the international conference in which our association participated were not very satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have succeeded in enforcing at least that.
I think that’s the way we have to go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this moment we are not considering that at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
The chairman of the specialized society of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
“In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was initiated as a volunteer,” says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcus from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcus is also groundbreaking in that it is the first land vaccination to be paid by health insurance and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on the prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, Cabrnochova craps.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is associated with a concern of the practical pediatricians concerning the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and then the doctors should receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that insurance companies could "export the money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until insurance pay them.
It is estimated that individual practical physicians will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught when inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle with trailers.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used an excavator to invade the museum in the Pocono mountains.
81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family hostility.
The agency reported, according to a police oath statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should penetrate the museum with all the means to bring all the paintings into a camp."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior denied any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
The ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the pre-establishment report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling had “missed” an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing the decisions until after the election.
The Treasury Chancellor was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent limit on public wage statements for 2011.
Social Security Disaster
The unions, on the other hand, have protested that low-wage recipients are punished for a recession they did not cause and have warned of upcoming “problems.”
The increase in social security – to about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has annoyed the private sector, saying it is a tax on jobs, although attention should be paid to economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
STRONG FUNCTIONS OF THE VORAB STATE REPORT
Increase of social security by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economy shrinks by more than expected 4.75%
New 50% Tax on Bankers Bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of State pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 per year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of deficit reduction by 2013 would mean "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burdens would be accounted for the 5% of the top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and expenditure stops compared to the necessary measures would be “a drop on the hot stone.”
"These are big numbers. They will bring us the deficit half, and this is absolutely necessary for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Forecasts by the Labour Party about future economic growth – which influences the extent of new debt and the speed of deficit removal – were questioned after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink 4.75% this year – far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
Conservatives, planning to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers failed to submit a credible plan on how to repay it and push themselves “cynically” in front of difficult decisions until after the election – which must take place no later than June 2010.
"They didn't say anything of importance about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass by."
“The major announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police be saved from future cuts, unlike in the proposals of conservatives, which see deficit shortages coming faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money earned by tax increases and spending stops is being used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said some at the time of the announcements — like the above inflation adjustment for some disabled pensions next April — would expose the treasury chancellor to the accusation of voting, as the money could simply be retrieved next year.
Labour insists on providing extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation be reviewed again in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the ministers did not announce any state details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will only come into effect in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said the Treasury Chancellor’s figures would mean strong declines in many areas, possibly also in the areas of transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said his leader Robert Chote.
“The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins it,” added Roger Bootle, economic advisor at the business audit firm Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow preliminary budget report, and the markets realize that."
FBI Investigates "Attempts of U.S. Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI investigates the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, eastern Panjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were reported missing in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
“If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are charged with and under what circumstances they are being detained,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrests and was connected with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had been interested in the house earlier and that no charges have been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the US must "work closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns “misuse” in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, it is still as bad about human rights in Iran as it has been in the past 20 years.
The report details "patters of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said at the beginning of the protests the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak criminal facility.
But since then, there has been no longer any tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report by 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with “working with Facebook networks” and protesting against the election results.
"They hit me in the face more times," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
Beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some demonstrators who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been detained in a container at a prison in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the courts had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the reactions of the government to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and power of these institutions would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that at least 90 people have been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park, ski slopes have been set up
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
Student John Hickman, who is studying medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that shine below.
He added, "There are some of the country's best skiers and snowboarders here - some true talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces of art performed on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a construction ban on minarets and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe were widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most explicitly secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (original title: "Why the French don't like headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely arguing study of a dispute issue that the country shared and occupied over a decade and a half and its impact can still be perceived today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a wider and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is actually happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic Free Spaces."
He is a good listener, he debates between teachers and students about the questions that worry them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane affairs, he claims, that make up everyday life, quite in contrast to the political dramas that the media occupy.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other hand in a modern secular society.
They don’t have all arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists interviewed by Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi opposites – advocates of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – which now shows a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite, which so passionately guards the separation of church and state) feel truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognizes a "sharpening of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most distressing outlook in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes them melts at alarming speed and takes life with it that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, maritime and fisheries interests have been embarking on the recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Engaged in the complex history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic researchers who have proven themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old flagman to the sea who fought only with the rifle piston of his muskets is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught as they swim behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically possess one millionth of the area of life of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore has become quite green from the algae growing in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose for the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor-slide-driving Inuit use powerful storm rifles to put their prey on track.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a captivating insight into how the future could evolve.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
This is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries suggested for the first time the whirlwind of the pack ice.
Underwater boats measure the shifting ridges during the Cold War.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the flow system within the Arctic ice, formed by salt water canals compressed during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little miracles in the ice, all are threatened when the summer ice once passes, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, that could be us."
Marine soldiers were among the 6,000 who deposited crowns in Arlington.
De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine soldiers who took the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they have walked.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we could be," Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay crowns on the tombs of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and a few others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this journey every year, stop in various cities along the way to carry out events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has also extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 crowns on tombs at the Arlington Cemetery, in areas of the Pentagon, on tombs at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at the Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the crowns for the second time.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to return something to those who brought victims.
She said that is a small contribution to how we can support civilians our soldiers.
It is like visiting a family tomb.
Packed in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older tombs from the First and Second World War and the Vietnam War as their target, as they are not visited as often as the recent tombs, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played, and couples held their hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round crown was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals cryed openly, others prayed, and families and friends clinged to each other in the icy air.
Some read the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white square cards that had been put into the damp mud for those whose tombstones were not finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the tomb of Marine Infantry Deputy Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
“If I’ve been away for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor selling mobile phones and notebooks in the country, Foreign Ministry officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, is working for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the U.S. International Development Authority and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the U.S. Interest Office in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been released, although Cuban law permits a Cuban citizen or foreign visitor to be arrested for almost anything accused of “danger.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will likely increase tensions between the Castro brother’s communist administration in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will make a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earning of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, and it is used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily salary.
Internet usage is extremely restricted on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Many websites have limited access.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are sitting behind grids for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman for the U.S. representation of interest in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and imprisonment are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", who recently released a tough report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same brother of Cuba", replacing the sickness of Raul Castro, the leader of the country.
Vivanco said the defendants would be arrested, convicted and imprisoned very often within a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, precisely at the time the two countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday discovered an alleged leader in a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching for radicalized young men on the Internet.
Investigators said they had been looking for an opaque rebel, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after finding them because one of them had commented on terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Upon their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote territory in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan’s intelligence agency, who was informed of the matter, said Saturday Saifullah could not convince Al Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far away from the unhosted mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, the government official said, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to obtain the right recommendations to get access to Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement agencies.
The case of the five men – who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI – underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more importantly in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. intelligence agency has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as porters who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American recruits are undergoing a special examination by A Qaeda, analysts said.
Due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be tremendously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the top analyst of the NEFA foundation based in the U.S., said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious over the past few years when it comes to whom they will allow access, as U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts on their recruitment methods.
“If you try to bring someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed,” Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters demand climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched here through the streets on Saturday, calling for bolder action in climate protection from the negotiators at the city’s Bella congress centre.
Demonstrators said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be about 25,000.
The event went relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists ignited small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
On one day, when the UN-supported climate negotiations had little happened, thousands of activists with transparents wandered through the city, on which it was written in English “There is no Planet B” and one in Spanish that declared “The Earth says “enough.”
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, her mother’s homeland, makes her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to face due to the already noticeable impacts of climate change.
That’s part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the big demonstration – to spread the word and appeal to the world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
It’s not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there’s no way around it anymore.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one spectator who did not want to be named because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing lit several explosives near the main Copenhagen Channel, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as light rockets, but were then followed by "a few major explosions."
Inside the congress centre, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the awareness of major officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thinks the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then went on in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “one can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people.”
Examination data shows persistent race gap
The mathematical performance testimony was last week welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington District is still far behind the country’s high-performance schools, evidence shows that fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but their African American peers rose only by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 points to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African American eighth graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown over this period of time, the difference has barely decreased with 58 points now.
Some proponents of the district’s education expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were driven for the most part by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group advocating for educational equality in Washington, D.C..
I do not jump up and down for a two- or three-point range, said Washington Democratic City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a common critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the exam scores is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, which I respect.
What scares me, however, is that we don’t spend nearly the time and energy that we should spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of poor students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading program, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of primary and secondary school, which did not master basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and which lag significantly behind their same age classmates.
Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and real-life experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and attributed to this curriculum some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we have to continue to work on making the best measures benefit students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the extra money and resources for poor schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who examines urban examination results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C..
The objective could have political consequences that work against this important agenda item.
The weak point, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to make sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to close the power gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teacher union last year on 185 days a year, which he sees as “a milestone” on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The coach reaches Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, climbs out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, brick façades and emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents barely completed high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth graders of the group exploring Gettysburg, where lessons cost $38,690 a year, was more that of an honorable visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I'll be here soon!" cried Graciela, who likes to study medicine, when the Führer announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thoughtfully said when she was reported on the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the United States who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college training necessary to rise to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generations" of Hispanic Americans is completing college – which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without completing high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive for success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counselling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if these efforts persist for a long time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point will not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that was funded by Graciela’s college tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - One Gear Up - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they have finished high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi oil ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to cause larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The ten contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi oil ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to account for shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participating in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that issued a bid has drawn the shorter bid.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for auctioned fields in June.
The thin-seeded representatives of American oil multiples at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of US companies, Asians and Europeans are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns that were still underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability due to the U.S. military’s withdrawal have likely prevented American oil companies from engaging more in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest proven crude oil reserves.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to enter into contracts with the Ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been assisted with technical advice in recent years, have gone out of the way.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the oil ministry spokesman, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to become one of the biggest in the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be able to measure itself with its co-offerers and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
Pre-selected companies issued bids for bidding, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda planner was reportedly killed this week, U.S. anti-terrorism officials reported Friday.
This would be, if it were to be confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior official of the terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were allegedly killed by a number of rockets that struck their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a drone type deployed by the CIA in the unlawful tribal belt of Pakistan.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the spot and quickly took up everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials reported indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as the leading military planner of al-Qaeda, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of US air strikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as given, it included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and put them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalia had rapidly risen in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and had the best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists, was killed in a similar attack.
The pace of CIA drone attacks has decreased since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be based on improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their attackability while at the same time brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul to resign
The leading UN envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday he would resign from office in March, ending a stormy term blurred by claims of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he is supporting the troop increase, but he also expressed concerns that the US military withdrawal schedule, which is expected to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their armed forces.
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghan people that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian assistants to help Afghanistan’s political transformation.
The increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but only fulfilling an agreement made to his family in March 2008 to stay only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted the notification to the U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to take a replacement.
“What I said is that he’s better to start looking for a successor,” Eid said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun searching for a replacement.
UN officials say he considered Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Oath's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of preferring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential elections and hiding evidence of massive election fraud.
Eid rejected all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith's accusations - who was fired - "undoubtedly caused harm to the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism regarding international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid actions of the American-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment over the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the complicated UN posture rules have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules have been designed to be able to hire only one person since May, he said.
This is catastrophic and should not go on so.
US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran because he has not participated in talks about its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a seven-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and lowered the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good choices in Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that I’m sorry about is, if we’ve learned something from Iraq over the last six years, that is unpredictable to war.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a “packet of positive and negative incentives” is needed “to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons” because “its people will suffer enormously from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government joined European leaders in warning that Iran must expect “credible” consequences if its nuclear program fails to comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organization, the International Nuclear Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology is only to be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks about restricting its nuclear program and would waive a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community standing in relation to some proposals it had already approved in early October openly brought the international community, including the Russian and Chinese, together in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set the 31st Dec as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before it will continue to pursue other options, including those that Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “oppressive sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian representation to the United Nations condemned what it on Thursday called "unfounded and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, saying they are willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concern about the upcoming withdrawal of troops. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
Change of course in ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters giving them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One baby more means one grave more."
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai who suddenly started changing the course due to the low birth rate and the ageing population this summer, encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "Not at all."
We have invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a HR manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has generated two generations of notoriously thick, displaced single children lovingly called "little emperors", a population crisis is rising in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 when this policy came into effect, the UN reported.
The Population Issues Department is set to rise explosively, while the number of populations aged 60 and older in 2020 is expected to rise from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent, which is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples at fertile age must have babies to “help reduce the ratio of the ageing population and alleviate the shortage of labor in the future.”
"Shanghai will soon be as old -- but not as rich -- as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Anchored in the Constitution of the country in 1978, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Married couples who violate this policy are facing enormous fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy that the critical use of national natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights officials have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to abort.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government officials have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule—including town residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husbands and wives have been single children—and in 2007, the sound of many hard slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at Beijing University, said government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples two children with a partner being single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines describing in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not very encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said a boom is evident in the applications of couples who want a second child after the campaign starts, the city districts, on the other hand, do not report any change.
For example, in the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications per month are received.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the expected number of births in the city in 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign — slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai community of Caolu, said that financial considerations are likely the main reason why many people don’t want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children, and this is legally permitted.
But they, like many Chinese, only own a minor government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misrepresent the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
The problem is not just in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the staff manager, said she just wants a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others and we don’t really want to do so.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old owned by a translation company, said it unblue.
For middle-sized parents with a double career through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it’s about being successful and you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20-39-year-olds grew up seeing their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want such a life for themselves at all, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to rebuild your home" -- and the life plan -- "When the child is nine months old, you have to have a CV ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Develops Emissions Reduction Plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has once again set a focus on Friday with the release of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrialized nations to bear the biggest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important progress in a negotiation that runs out of time as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging markets can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise policymakers should be.
The process is given great flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to put the focus on what U.N. climate leader Yvo de Boer called “the great whole.”
It shows the ground plan of a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also boosted the talks on Friday by guaranteeing to allocate $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change – from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that determined the conversations last week.
U.S. Climate Special Officer Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, unless they are funded by industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration would have a tougher line with China as a Bush administration representative not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without rising up larger emerging markets and taking action, Stern said, complaining that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern made his statement an hour after the statement by Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, saying that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" from him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China master global warming.
With the future economic direction of the world’s great powers at stake, lines have opened up within industrialized nations, as well as between industrialized nations and emerging markets.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the great powers are struggling to find out who should bear the costs of braking greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved more aggressively to hold the countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic dominance, says Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty on early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the small island states’ offensive “exerces political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging markets such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the open questions need to be resolved before the arrival of the leaders of the government in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, disembarked from their planes and rushed through the Bella Center’s corridors to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to pick up claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The pure scale of the assembly -- 13,000 people go in and out daily at the congress centre, guitar-playing activists host nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries they think are betraying and selling, and contract drafts are hand-to-hand rather than by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just growing: almost all the major ministers are here now and from Wednesday on they will be 60 leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy at Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
UK’s first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m. a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in UK traffic.
The first high-speed trail in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent to London St. Pancras and will travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then embark on the first Javelin Pendulum service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will ultimately connect to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively pendler cities, working journey times would be radically reduced, and the shift from airplane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still pull the brake on British high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will hand over Lord Adonis to the report on Dec. 30, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass through urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open grounds, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first route, which would not open before 2025, would allow travellers to travel the route London-Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The designs offer the trains the ability to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was designed to allow 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 passengers to ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could be operating per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that in London it would be necessary to have an end station where 20,000 passengers could be deployed per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued in his opinion, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he puts the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first need to switch from high-speed routes to existing railway routes in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be more than three hours between London and Scotland.
This is considered to be a critical point in order to ensure the transition from the plane to the railway, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for mortgage for a Conservative’s 75,000 pounds of orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading member of the Conservatives, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery that he had built in his home in his electoral district.
The party’s prison spokesman, degraded by David Cameron, complaining that House members have to live “from lean rations,” has raised his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak wood workshop at his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest revenue, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House approved the requests at the time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is carrying out a review of the expenses of the members of the House. Last night, Duncan said that the requests could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House, owns a two-storey house in a village in his district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of nearly a million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a downtown spending checkpoint, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a winter garden, which is referred to in the plans as "orangery".
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased receipt of money during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The committee released him from the breach of the rules last month after an investigation of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 (€300,000) from his London home to his district house, which he bought in 1991, a year before his election as a member of parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan was refunded approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the entire increase served to finance the fundraising of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 (€85,000).
The normal continuous RBS mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his position as the opposition leader of the Under House in September after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that parliamentarians would live "of lean rations."
“In essence, working for the state means living on lean rations and being treated like S******e.”
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden, and I have claimed a disappearingly small portion of what is owned.
And I could have claimed the whole damn sum, but I don’t.”
The member of Parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May over his spending when it became clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he clarified with the Fees Office that this could be considered "a excessive demand."
An activist dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound sign after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was questioned last night about the increased mortgage, Duncan said, "This was both approved by the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for the increased value."
He added: "There is no debate about evading and perforating or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly comprehensible and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all of you believers to admire Brighton's beach hut advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life as an interactive Advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that inspires spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1, and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottage every day from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. with free glow wine and traditional mince pies, pieces of pastries filled with dry fruit.
The Christmas songs so far selected are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a television marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said, “We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and hold exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and lively place and we are trying to express this through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate warming, where police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, and a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the brink of the UN climate conference, which is expected to lead to a conclusion that could come into force by Friday from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Chairman of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilization of the world for climate is contributing to this demonstration that the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, fully dressed in black, smashed windows with pavement stones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Police officers intervened immediately and without regard.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your assessment, were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these extreme violent split groups, which have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction," and has stressed that some hundred of them were "always detained in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold in handcuffs and in seat position.
The rather peaceful train went from parliament toward the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived with bushes and trains from the major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were present, as well as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them wearing sky blue raincoats, have made a first raid in the morning in Copenhagen as they have followed the call of the Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice."
Today, we are going to the streets to demand compensation for ecological guilt in favor of the south, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist for the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on saying to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that are drying out, waterways where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, the figure of globalization critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the struggle against climate warming and the struggle for another world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where many islands are located, which are particularly at risk due to warming, has given the starting point to the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people went to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and histed bandanas in which you praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, a few hundred demonstrators marched to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the 350 network gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "joke".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "joke".
Approximately 131,000 people were called upon to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetic Territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The elections are closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The electoral participation was approximately 58%, according to the Abkhazian electoral commission officials, a few hours before the closure of the election site.
The first results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, his press spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand people killed, Abkhazia wants to prove by means of this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have elected Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote at a polling station that was located in a school in the capital Soukhumi, voting for a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian President and the head of government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area, with 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the elections.
We, the people of Abkhazia, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented by the former Vice President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia to control the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus a vote is needed to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, at any time ready for operation, arrested about 700 people on the brink of a major demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, which are looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to invade.
A stage was built to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of demonstrators, who were fully dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began beating slices, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-unrest policemen immediately encircled you and intervened carelessly by throwing some of you on the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these extremely violent split groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury from a paving stone at the chin during the incidents, in which about twenty people were temporarily arrested, according to police. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said as the helicopters of the law enforcement circled in the air.
Most of the protesters arriving by train or by their own vehicle from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the "Friends of the Earth" called for a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climage correctness".
“Today we are going out on the streets to demand that the ecological debt be paid back to the people of the South,” activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen said.
“We can’t say we still have time,” says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa, there are rivers that are drying out, there are rivers that run through which you can walk, which was never the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of opponents of globalization has approached environmental organizations.
The French MP for the European Parliament and globalization critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the struggle against global warming and the struggle for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to the demonstrations.
In Australia, around 50,000 people went to the streets, according to the organizers.
In Manila, a few hundred people, most of them students, dressed in red with bandanas, have made advertisements for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of protesters have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the "Net of 350" several hundred people gathered together, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history, according to Chatel, emerge strengthened from the school reform of the lycées.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du Dimanche", National Minister of Education Luc Chatel stated that the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not obligatory in the terminals (12th school year).
"Première (11th school year) students now have every four week hours and the same program," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but, in general, a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientific," he continued, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged over the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lycea."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité revealed that nearly seven in ten French (69%) criticized the state project of deleting compulsory education in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained of this project, as well as the Left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question regarding a restriction of the philosophy of the Terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called on Tuesday to protest against the project, which he believes is the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that at the beginning of the year they underwent a professional qualification examination in Master 2 (M2) and an admission examination at the end of the year in which their teaching skills are examined.
They also conduct internships during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in the internship.
He said, "If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will reach more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally stated that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He once again confirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the engagement at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As an AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts each turn fifteen minutes with filmed contributions to the audience.
One would like to do something to reach people and make them feel like they want to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers this day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event comes from the name that the students gave to the fish in the school basin.
"Among the experts were selected around twenty participants, even according to their charisma," he clarified.
"On climate warming you can talk for hours, but the core goals can also be explained in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke freely to about 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed, hoping that listeners may learn from it that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific record."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school’s page from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months afterwards.
Delayed payments: angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of prison officials called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime, whose payment was deferred for budget reasons until January, are transferred before Christmas holidays.
The 2nd union of prison officers (“FO-Pénititiaire”) called on employees who have no service to demonstrate in front of the prison office on Tuesday morning and block them in order to draw attention to the “theft of what they owe.”
The 3rd union of prison officers (“CGT-Pénitiniaire”) called for “to unite to a strong mobilization in the various prisons” on which the non-payment of overtime, night surcharges, and Sunday and holiday surcharges in December is burned as “disgusting and unacceptable”.
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Prison Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the prison and the Ministry of Justice declared that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all were provided in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of prison officers guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about the staff's efforts to keep our prison system functional and to modernize it," the Minister of Justice said in the letter.
"I have directed the management of the prison to take immediate steps to ensure that such a situation, resulting from a lack of estimation of overtime, does not repeat itself in the future," Alliot-Marie said.
The December wage is thus lower, except for the management staff who receive high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budgetary constraints" must be maintained.
“This is an absolute scandal,” the interregional trade union FO in Marseille announced to boycott “all assemblies and convocations” to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays, when the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime", threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
“At a time when more and more tasks are being charged with us without hiring more personnel, trying to enrich ourselves with staff funds is more than inappropriate,” said the CGT trade union in Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he’s always giving Christmas better gifts than he gets himself.
President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas in the White House for the first time with his family, told TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he is always distributing better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special show broadcast on ABC on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how to spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with him from the game.
“Santa Claus also loves Bo,” Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will also get a gift.
Michelle Obama decided to reject her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts, saying, “I gave you beautiful gifts last year.”
"So please," he screamed her, pointing to the pearl chain of the First Lady, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an unforced atmosphere with the well-known television presenter whom Barack Obama had so strongly supported during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-course bike and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father once visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
"It was only much later in my life that I realized I had this ball from him."
The first lady remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Confirms He Has Been Into Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for significant "harms" after an operation in France, according to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "harms due to the surgery of a disc incident" that he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that the harms required re-operation.
The singer’s production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was “under control” and announced that a new medical expertise would be available at the latest within 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put in an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
However, it was only after 48 hours that we had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources emerges" that after its first operation in Paris "no drainage" was placed.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a disc incident.
The procedure planned over several days was carried out by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted Monday to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was in the opinion of RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley", but he assured that you need to "not worry" about the rock musician, as he is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was nonsense to sit on a plane twelve hours after such an operation," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained".
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and that he did not feel any special concern.
Nevertheless, worry about the singer’s health had grown ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he dropped on his yacht.
Two months later, a general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colon cancer" operating, which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded as planned his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
However, since then, every health problem has been extensively commented. Fans and journalists have not missed that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
Only in mid-November the people around him had to deny re-admission to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Short Train: First place for Bousquet about his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal winner at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the 2009 Euro on the short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, the last time polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flood was expected.
A record was improved by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m layers of the gentlemen.
Shame for Bousquet, who wanted to grab the world record in the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 seconds, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - an international premiere.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater and in this case I said, if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers launched in polyurethane suits, which are prohibited from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which first started at the same competition in 1999.
The use of the combination this time has not paid for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has achieved the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t win a world record today, but I defended my title and accomplished my job.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
U.S.: Tombplate at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tomb plate, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the third century AD and has always been valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, Vice President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in hundreds of pieces.
“The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what buyers have offered most so far,” Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The record spent nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she appeared piece by piece with French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the III French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When browsing the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras to Mexico has been broken
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the collapsed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil no longer compatible after the coup administration rejected it as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya during the night, everything seems to suggest that there is a disagreement as to how this transfer can be carried out, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration agency, the plane supplied by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring Zelaya, returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to "abdicate" and to seek political asylum abroad under guidance.
However, the toppled president refused to do so, as he wished to return to Mexico as a welcoming, appointed head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a renewed failure by moving me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to give up," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has frequently reported since the beginning of the political crisis that has been ongoing in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the fallen president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, hitting some chords.
The Mexican embassy has submitted a request for guidance to us, but we cannot accept it, as it does not include a request for asylum, Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday said Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute.
I am not seeking asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, would only act as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors about Zelaya’s exit on Wednesday had mobilized the followers of the toppled president who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, after which the military there had strengthened its operations.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government's position.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day of the popular survey he organized to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He had surprisingly returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves these, he is imprisoned for high treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Coup President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
In the course of the controversial election, Porfirio Lobo was recognised by the United States, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Algeria and Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against Zelaya’s return to office until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street in Recovery, U.S. Trade Balance Nourishes Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures on the U.S. trade balance show a recovery of the price of U.S. stocks and their partners: the Dow Jones increased by 0.67 percent and the Nasdaq by 0.33 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq rose from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 was written with 0.58 % (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There are good news from various sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on “semi-full glasses,” she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focused primarily on the figures of the U.S. trade balance sheet, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion as compared to September.
In contrast, analysts had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the overall volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of corporate research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen out of all expectations over the past week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers has fallen "to the low of the year" during the last four weeks, said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has declined.
The profitability of 10-year government bonds increased to 3,482% compared to the 3,432% of Tuesday night, while the profitability of 30-year government bonds rose to 4,492% compared to the 4,408% of the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of ruling partisans whistle out "Women in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban-powered partisans whipped out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day, as well as overthrew another demonstration, due to which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily detained.
Around the forty "ladies in Weiss", wives or close political prisoners, were waved on open streets by government partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were on a foot march to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankees!, "Millers!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Living Fidel and Raul!" the authorized partisans screamed with a lifted fist against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "provide their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in Weiss" had taken place in Havana the evening before, with neither injuries nor arrests.
In Havana’s Vedado district, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also opened for Thursday’s demonstration in the face of International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by civilian police officers, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to the reporter, the police forced dissidents engaged by government partisans to enter civilian vehicles using force.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in Weiss" have organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of the "Please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number, according to the dissident list, is about 200, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda sentenced to 20 years in prison.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the regime opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” at the service of the declared arch enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on demonstrations between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries” on Thursday.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of defaming rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Crazy man kills eighty-year-old with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-knife-armed madman killed an eighty-year-old and injured five others on Friday late afternoon at the main business time in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first information of the interview, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old with two knives in or before a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, for an unclear cause, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a police syndicate Alliance official in the hospital, declared the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he has caught up with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the 1930s, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were hospitalized seriously injured, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured is at risk of death, as he, according to police sources, appears to have been affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman became ill as a result of the events and she was reportedly hospitalized in a "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to stand under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to police reports, was immediately fled to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passengers, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of both severely.
The scenario remained dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two carnivore knives he wore crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a head of the Alliance Syndicate of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including young people, are reported to have tried to steal the mad one, according to the witness reports investigated by the AFP.
I saw a guy in the thirties wearing a green vest.
Three young people were trying to intervene.
They didn’t do it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, two city policemen, including their supervisor, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife stabbing, according to police reports.
The event has been played in one of the main veins of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passants have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I brought her to first aid position and noticed a clamping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, was injured by cut wounds.
Police officers arrested the man who did not carry identification documents.
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre has commissioned the District Reference of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not exclude him from being admitted to a nerve hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to confiscate him at the police office in Clichy, where he had been deported.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" like "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the tathering process."
USA: Polanski’s lawyer calls for a new stop to law enforcement
French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski’s lawyer repeatedly called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to stop prosecution of his client, who is currently tried at his place of residence in Switzerland for a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", denounced gross trial errors at the time of the negotiations in 1977 before three judges of the Appeal Court in the second district of California.
I ask for a sentence, Mr. Hummel explained before adding that the behavior of Judge Laurence Rittenband, charged with the case at the time of the trial, "let it run down a cold back".
According to him, the now-deceased judge Rittenband, before he gave his judgment, discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a prison -- which represents a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), specifically by the contested prosecutor David Wells.
Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had “lied” to the authors of the documentary.
If the Court refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the conduct of a proceedings that would enable him to provide evidence for his argument.
The indictment, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the repeal of the crimes charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered unless Roman Polanski appears in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, before the penalty was announced for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years old.
Since then, he has not travelled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to attend the trial.”
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that the escape is a way out?, asks Ms. Asayma.
“The filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus disregards his authority.”
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even stressed that “there were other alternatives to escape.”
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer also called for the criminal proceedings to be repealed.
She recalled that her client would no longer be able to be harassed by every resurrection of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years are enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September on the grounds of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed without a price on Friday in a market that was swept back and forth between better indicators than expected in the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq rose by 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Advanced Index rose by 0.37 percent (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is quite quiet,” noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
“It remains narrowly limited, the trading volume has become very small and I think that will remain so until the end of the year.”
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "contributed to improving the market perspective on the solidity of the recovery of the economy," Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in a row and far more than expected.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan Index Preview.
However, the indices have been slowed by a new rise in the dollar price, which has reached its highest level over the euro in two months, pushing the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation down," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield of the 10-year-old treasury bond increased by 3,540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3,482% and the yield of the 30-year-old bond to 4,497 % compared to 4,492% on the previous day.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month’s round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday will overcome the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be elected the world’s most beautiful woman and this in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is hosted for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already secured their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true truth of pleasure.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn was simply extraordinary.
I have seen a lot of things and had a lot of experience!” said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5 p.m. (CET).
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova emphasized in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experiences with candidates and the rediscovery of " breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press encounters and safari, the Miss is now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to once be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but this is not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defile in traditional costumes and not to forget, in swimsuit.
The presentation is presented by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, the ex-Queen of Beauty from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss World committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with a hardly overwhelming warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairman of the Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted by bicycle and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite exceptional.
Not usually for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
However, her most beautiful memory remains undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote a little more for this event.
I am dealing with people I would probably never be able to approach otherwise.
I will surely return to the 2010 World Cup, promised enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive" according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David said on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who had been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he got out of the plane, where he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. CET) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "fastest" go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a disc surgery on November 26.
The singer was put into an artificial coma in Los Angeles this night in order to alleviate his severe pain and perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an intervertebral surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes resulting from the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event in the French high school in Los Angeles where her daughter Jade goes to school on Friday morning, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatic Surgery at Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has heavily burdened neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on 26 November.
We were told that he did the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were totally outraged, Mr. Camus explained.
I have heard that you might be starting a court proceeding, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "received Los Angeles too quickly with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I spoke to this doctor personally, who assured me that he looked at this trip as completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I myself already had two vertebral disks surgery behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer apparently would have left the hospital "without drainage, without anything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a doubtful reputation, who has already been convicted several times due to failed operations and not to forget, for tax default and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Medical Chamber, has described him as "a man without scruples, who has to be responsible "regularly" before the chamber's board and is "everything other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The surgery "caused no bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have grown since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr. Camus explained.
The Party Alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre Party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, supervised by François Bayrou’s party MoDem, reacted violently on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party formerly founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, by the party chairman of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and urged him, threatening a court prosecution, not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal because he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he gave his hand to the left.
By the way, the Defense Minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In reaffirmation of his efforts, he had received the support of Member Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF trade mark, since he was the first to apply for this trade mark at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle" in 2004.
However, the office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by François Bayrous' friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they were not expropriated and set the minister and the deputy under the threat of prosecution a deadline to stop using this seal and to transfer the trademark's ownership rights to it.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take the UDF seal, the alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
They also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today’s UDF+, on their political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF headquarters declared, urging the NC Party to "remove the mention of the name UDF from all material and (its) website without delay".
Hervé de Charette was also required "to transfer the proprietary rights of the trade mark to its legal entitlements".
If you refuse to do so, we will bring a lawsuit against you in order to comply with the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978, recalling that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave this 2007 to start a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to found the UMP party.
According to the signatory, the Nouveau Centre has therefore no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recalled that the last UDF Congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem Party and the establishment of a office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the Movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years at the time when he applied for the brand name" but rather of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he benefits from the absence of the deposit of the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
Furthermore, let us bear in mind that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a criminal offence, and ironize the strategy of the NC: “It seems more dignified to us in politics as well as in life to make a name for ourselves rather than trying to get out of anonymity by assuming a name in fraudulent way, on which one has no rights.”
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier convicted of exploitation of weakness
The Court of Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, as billionaire Liliane Bettencourt's daughter claims, exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-old to snatch some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be liable to court on April 15 and 16, 2010 for exploitation of weakness, a crime punished with a maximum imprisonment of three years and a fine of €375,000.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are fucked and at the same time have the twists of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical investigation of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions presented during the investigation by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to submit a report before March 10, 2010, in which you clearly announce whether and when Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undergo these investigations.
I will talk to her, Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, explained after the trial.
As far as Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer Olivier Metzner is concerned, he is very satisfied with the court’s decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The expert opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he reaffirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of having exploited her mother’s weakness for years to sneak a total of €1 billion in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted to have been manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-standing friend.
Although the court would have to assess the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ advocates led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer referred to three letters sent to her notary by her client (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she did not trust Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to talk to Françoise since her marriage.”
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre once again believes that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardian’s judge in recent days has refused her request to initiate a judicial protection proceeding against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor’s representative.
The court has now decided to render a judgment after the process of admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the end of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the administration of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined to impose the best as it was previously designed on the consumer products by the technicians in the factory.
By placing the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately factors to impose customers’ preferences again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicide at France Telecom, PSA or Renault is just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&E and, which is even more crucial, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) "demands from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking view"; it claims from employees a task to which the instructions of the authoritarian management are completely contrary.
That is why we demand an operational revolution that would consist in placing employees at the center of the company’s concerns equally next to the customer.
The highly conditional benefits of internal opinion surveys
Will the internal opinion surveys, like the questionnaire Orange submitted to its wage recipients, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that the entire fabric, in the face of a new situation, after many circumstances, eventually comes to doing first and foremost what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - is increasing in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a very simplified idea of human behavior.
Derived from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They assume through intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactivated by U.S. "neurosciences" and unknowingly widely spread by research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to operate the "lever" (sic) to the engagement of employees, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr encourages executives in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of control: for wage recipients, engagement with the company is only possible if it seems clearly as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and plans.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take on this concept of motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predetermined Doxa that allows them through their perceived image of the company to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business executives can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
Thus, they create a fertile soil that is conducive to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo’s speech: “just war” brings Obama praise from the right
U.S. Rights welcomed the speech delivered by Barack Obama on the eve of Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who mocked the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the president’s speech, following the example of the former Vice-Presidential candidate in the 2008 election, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself raised the theme of a “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
Of course, war is the last thing that I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of violence; a way to declare his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president did “very good work” in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, rejoiced the former Chairman of the House of Representatives, who especially acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts I felt this speech completely historical, explained Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, viewed by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to see a "President of the Left" reminding members of the Nobel Committee that they "are not free and could not hand over a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has “haven a very American speech.”
In addition to depicting himself as a “cosmopolitan,” as he “always does,” he “speaked like an American president,” pointing out that Europeans “live like a security bubble that they didn’t create themselves and don’t do much to protect them,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced right-wings, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era hawk, described his speech on the National Review Online website as “boring, high-staying and inspirationless.”
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is worried about how Barack Obama defends the recourse to the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, you can simply justify the massacre of the innocent, he warns.
The moderate left press, however, remains praising on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama prematurely, called the speech itself "monumental work" for a speaker like him, known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "provides a running schedule to manage international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily newspaper said.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and calls his speech “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Distance drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that secures Christmas supply
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the unions of the road association and the TLF – the only employer organization that remained until the end – reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the strike warrant and the threat of severe supply shortages at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, State Secretary for Transport Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement, which began on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
Following a second night of negotiations, the negotiators split up early Friday morning in hopes of rapidly signing the agreement late in the morning.
And that even though the three employer associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the beginning of the meeting at 11 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed only at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had done a lot of harm to the companies" and "it was to be worried that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“It’s not very much, but we start small,” says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed to no longer block the supply centers.
“However, there will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement,” he added.
TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is at 170 euros per month for the low and at 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on a "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3 % and the maintenance of the overall road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will enable in particular to address the issue of the 13th monthly salary and the modernization of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the decline of taxes for employers in the amount of €100 million" was the subject of a government amendment to the bill of corrected finances for 2009, which was passed on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government calls for “identical” vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated with this organization, and subsequently to apply to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time," insured Bussereau.
The opposition of the employer associations can only delay the proceedings.
The FNTR association denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the €100 million "was already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but to not fade the goose-eaters on the upcoming Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens "to throw a big grave to the small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the coming 12 months."
Line RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Paris area and the Île-de-France region, continued this weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Parisian Passenger Transport Administration) keeps strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central train (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready for operation and outside the central train only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced travellers to switch.
The retail chain Galeries Lafayette, which has 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is trying to connect the major stores traffic-technically".
The RER A line crosses the Parisian metropolitan area from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains was scheduled to the main traffic time, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human tumult on the railroads, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overcrowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), declared that he had “wakened up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time.”
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of travellers by staff and law enforcement officials, pointed out that there had been no congestion at the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A from or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or sailed via the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metro stations.
On Saturday and Sunday, the general meetings of the strikers took place again, during which the results that the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leaders on Friday afternoon were reviewed.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (South), they are demanding a long-paid salary surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that RATP itself puts its wage surcharge proposals in parentheses, emphasizing that the leadership “is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the distance drivers and the SNCF.”
The RATP made it clear that a re-meeting for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" is planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignorates the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers sought the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the head of leadership that to date rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after a pre-announcement by Unsa and Independents.
The associations demand a salary surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 Euros, of which 30 Euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents) and complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of work experience, will receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a salary supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party; a decision that followed immediately angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to enormously complicate the work of the government, which is striving to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the 25-year conflict.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become "a place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the president of the Constitutional Court, Hasim Kiliç, said four days after the decision was issued to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been unanimously made by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution, and he noted that 37 of the party’s leaders, including President Ahmet Türk and Parliamentary Member Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political event for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed their views before the verdict that Parliamentarians would rather leave parliament rather than meet like partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a proceeding initiated in 2007 by the Turkish federal court’s prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, accusing the DTP of following the “sages” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Ankara and numerous other countries view as a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has “no connection” with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court works in between by the government, which strives to meet the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to stop the support of the PKK by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution could lead to a renewed outbreak of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan’s detention conditions in recent weeks had led to clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP premises in the million-town of Diyarbakir in the southeast, predominantly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water throwers as the protesters began to throw molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the judgment, Türk assumed that the court’s decision would “deepen the despair further.”
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish) question on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
That doesn’t solve the problems,” Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
"This decision is a torpedo of the democratic opening that was promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Isle.
“Obviously, you can be prepared for a reaction by the PKK,” he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven troops in the north of Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
Rather, so that his employees can test and master all the vehicle technology.
This weekend, meteorologists say, it could be the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES follows an accurate plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-trails with large scattered vehicles will be departed, Brauburger explains.
These include main roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting accesses, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and trails with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service begins at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which is better adhered.
That’s why the FES starts at three o’clock at night, “so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts.”
It will be difficult if it doesn’t snow until 7:30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scattering vehicles."
Only afterwards, if it does not snow further, are feeder and exploration lines, including the Rat-Beil-Straße, on the turn.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger.
At five o’clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES are on their way, danger points and transitions are prioritized.
Often the FES can’t take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which mainly keeps an eye on the bridges from 10am to 4:30pm, Brauburger says.
Since there is on this quick smoothing, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the move.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other flesh-eating dinosaurs: the two-foot-long and 1.50-foot-long animal ran on two strong back legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would not be special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, report Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began a dig on Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly only single fragments can be found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current teaching, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils, however, are incomplete, which is why the allocation of these original dinos is often controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the hedgehogs split into their three main development lines: the flesh-eating theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the velociraptor, and also the birds, known as the "Langheal", the four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plants freshently.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found clues of airbags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropode with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also possessed airbags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the hedgehogs first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America across all the worlds, which at that time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangea.
For this, the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be derived from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are, of course, contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted image could arise because in South America, many of the most primitive dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant land vertebrates of the Earth’s Middle Ages is still mysterious.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying-saurs, and with numerous other axes.
By the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the relatives at the border of the Trias to the Jura erupted.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs randomly survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite hit a group of animals that had also developed in the Trias and since then has been eating a shadow: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto stand on the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley, California.
Lecturers from Naples are here, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is beating waves around the world.
278 professors and teachers from the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America solidarise with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they “disapprove” of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, the signatories judge, did not justify “the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command.”
The eviction represents an "unacceptable interference" with the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimation and criminalization of the protest" and diverts from the contents.
The Bureau has avoided the necessary discourse.
The teachers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, it says.
Legitimate Protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union association are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi Land Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the Unipresident and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said at a current hour on Thursday at the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have understanding of the protest, but we have no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition groups SPD, Greens and Left saw this differently.
The CDU uses painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (left) said.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have cleared up.
The Left has submitted a request calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded site in the Soviet Union for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality, with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the centre of Moscow, is regarded as the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, Selenograd’s representatives have been in contact with the Frankfurt-based science site Riedberg – with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning division Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies are allowed to take foot in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science firms want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics Engineering, the large corporations Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the wooded hill landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than deepening a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg’s state capital city into a decade of heavy construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headways with railways that ended in the middle of the city were then considered to be 19th-century traffic fossils, which acted as brake blocks of modern railway transport, as it once took enormous time to span locomotives from the rear to the fore.
Get in, stay short, continue driving - that's how we're going.
And that’s why the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station that is about halfway from the trans-European railway magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is actually being addressed now, although the visions of the 1980s are long since no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost invaluable in the Hessian and Bavarian city to implement deepening.
However, headway stations no longer have any entry and exit problems, since there are modern turnarounds with motor vehicles and steering wagons at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 along with the ICE new construction route to Ulm is now being approached.
Local and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway is also involved because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project bears the Republic of taxpayers and not the state group.
In terms of urban design, the project can still be justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, which - it is believed that the computer-generated graphics of the planners - will be equipped with lots of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit railway station and the expansion of the routes are intended for passenger traffic, which is typically attributed to enormous growth in the 1980s.
At the time there was no competition for cheap aircraft.
Modern transport policy, however, must first be about strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is significantly more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new construction track is not suitable for freight trains because of heavy slopes.
Even more serious is that S21 also indirectly engages many other railway projects.
About six billion euros will be buried in Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing at other hubs and narrow points on the net.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometre route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, it has been built on the track at a slow pace.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
However, S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go into revision against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has hired experts to have the VGH judgment, which covers more than 400 pages, legally examined, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had written reasons that the country had to re-regulate the night-fly ban in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest Landing Railway at Frankfurt Airport.
The authorization of 17 flights between 23 and 5 a.m., as the state government envisages, is not in agreement with the legally required protection of the population from nightly flight noise.
The coalition has to decide by 4 January whether to go against the verdict.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged government representatives to waive a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, head of the SPD group, urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election on a night flight ban, otherwise it would be considered a "word breach".
It’s damn hard if you can keep your word, Green Chief Tarek al-Wazir said in an allusion to the FDP’s election slogan “We keep the word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's accusation that the state government is still trying to come to their night flights with "right twist and trick."
An accurate legal examination takes your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As they represent the opposition, his group’s statements on the ban on night flight had never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
Crisis-shaken U.S. large banks are cutting off their state chains.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the aid from the banking rescue fund Tarp in the amount of a total of $45 billion (about 30 billion euros) at one blow.
And Citigroup also plans to reimburse state aid, according to a report by US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money, such as the limitation of the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America was worried about converting bonds for $19 billion of fresh money from investors.
She took the remainder of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by split sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday night that the money injection helped during a very difficult time.
The moneyhouse was at the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also intends to raise money on the capital market in order to exempt its liabilities to the state.
Even on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid back their aid.
Quick choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF board of directors pushed the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night the panel wanted to vote on the personality.
Favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster for this - officially so as not to advance the proceedings.
However, it should have also played a role in not harming ZDF Intendant Markus Schächter further if this proposal should not be passed by the Board of Directors either.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The outcome of the vote was not yet established at the end of the editorial session.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, Schächter failed in the board of directors.
Only seven members voted for Brender, and seven voted against him, but Brender's defeat was a fierce defeat for Schäfer, but one expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the board of directors had signaled weeks before the election that Brender would not be confirmed in office.
The resistance had been organized against the editor-in-chief of Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, the news broadcasts of the ZDF had lost in entry rates, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which political influence on the ZDF was whipped.
Lastly, even 35 state lawmakers had interfered in the debate, which considered Koch’s action unconstitutional.
It's nothing useful.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romanticism.
Afterwards he worked at the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, first to the "today-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "morning magazine"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional suit after Brenders was elected journalist of the year by the industry magazine Medium on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart in the board of directors, the Rhineland-Pfalz Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the manager’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a removal of party politicians from the supervisory boards of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender’s expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the board of directors with a wise move - by criticizing the panel heavily for it immediately after the Brender selection.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both a whistleblower without loss of face to the post of chief editor and to elect the board of directors without coming into suspicion of hiving a party candidate into office.
In party arithmetics Frey is attributed to the left liberals anyway.
Study is dismissed
Part Success for the students: After a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Culture of the Countries finally introduced on Thursday: at a meeting of Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors Conference, both sides agreed to want to improve the conditions of study at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the exam burdens: basically, each study module should only be completed with a single exam.
In addition, the workload of the students will be checked and a "realistical and reasonable measure" will be ensured.
Policy and universities also aim to simplify the recognition of exam performance between universities within and outside Germany.
Countries undertook to make common structural requirements for bachelor’s and master’s degrees more flexible.
In addition, there are no different country rules.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors are carrying the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
It was filled with a specific content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to partially reduce the number of exams drastically: "Every module usually completes with only one exam," it is stated in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of degree programs.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Council, said that the "significant reduction of the exam burden" should be used to "deter a failure to develop, which significantly affected the studyability."
Furthermore, "studyability" should be the "decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content must be "strongly checked" if "unnecessary efforts of the students in choosing the
Events would be avoided.
The students would have an incentive to obtain rooms that enable and encourage their own initiative.
The rules should apply to the admission of new programs, but also to the review of existing programs.
These must be “reaccredited” every five years, however, which means that it will take until 2015 before all degree programs are reviewed.
Ten national accreditation agencies are responsible for accreditation, subject to the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture called on the countries to "surely" act on the agencies in such a way that the filling of substances is not too large and the testing regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities have already agreed with the state ministries to take appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has allocated additional funding for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities are intended to set up tutoring programmes and strengthen study counselling as well as examination and abroad offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
According to this, only one exam is needed to complete a study model.
Study design is intended to be more flexible, to ensure the recognition of proofs of performance at other universities and to facilitate access to the master’s degree.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country will be reviewed for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition had again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso Higher Education Groups called for the design of educational policies to no longer take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and higher education directors.
At the latest, after the educational strikes, the students as affected should now also "speak a word with".
The future academics received support from the president of the Higher Rector Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said at a meeting with the ministers of culture with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper on Thursday.
The union of education and science (GEW) did not go far enough: it calls for a legal claim that allows any graduate with a bachelor’s degree access to a further master’s degree program.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that adequate master’s degree places are available tomorrow for today’s generation of bachelor students with the best possible studies conditions, says GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and getting out of it is almost no control..." is the initial line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which he, in disturbing speech, discusses the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom but at the same time lost his speech space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children’s book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literary Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused significant extra-literary insight during a meeting in Munich last Tuesday, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distortion mirror of its security acts".
Söllner was visiblely uncertain and disappointed, reading a statement in which he admitted to Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as an IM for the Romanian intelligence service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun sleakingly, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who hasn't defended himself enough against intimidation attempts by the Securitates."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary debate with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that identifies the depths and depression of a political system based on monitoring and spying.
Werner Söllner is not only a perpetrator, but also a victim, to the extent that one can say according to the previous level of knowledge.
In his Securitate records, IM Walter played a role, according to the confession of Söllner the literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had "cut him out" in all points that were difficult for him at that time, Markel said.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but completely surprising is not the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany was a comfortable reserve for Securitate Spitzel, Herta Müller wrote in July after reading her own 914-page file.
The affected persons, it can be suspected, are speculated and in some cases they probably also knew which clear name was hidden behind the nicknames Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
Unlike in the case of the very procedurally secure viewing of the Stasi records in this country, dealing with the legacies of the Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic enlightenment has been undermined and impaired.
A corresponding National Council for the Security Records (CNSAS) was established in 1999, but the issue of the files has been slow since then.
It was only since 2005 that there was a law governing the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large proved in an interview with Herta Müller after the announcement of the Nobel Prize, in which a former Chief of Securitate from Temesvar rejected the winner.
She had a psychosis, after all, she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, in the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with secret guilt, inevitable questions arise.
The wise reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by a need for knowledge rather than by guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller’s work, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Schedule Champions League
It seemed like a dressed outside officer was just coming from a pretty nice Christmas party, where a sports goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment manufacturer, climbed into a called C-Class one quarter after midnight.
The man with the striking baldness was taken in because of the town still alien to him.
Otherwise he would have been able to drive himself - alcohol wasn't in the game, and drunk with luck the 55-year-old wasn't.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow’s work is going on.
Or just get started.
In the words of the Swissman who had committed only three days earlier: "While we have reached the eighth-finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal-class performance in the daily league in Mainz.
And to eliminate the weaknesses quite again revealed after the quick three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The eighth-finals of the Champions League (16th/17th + 23th/24th February/9th/10th + 16th/17th March) will be drawn on 18th December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant invasion of the Babbel successor remained therefore unconducted.
Not only did the alleged Salvierungsbringer, who had conveyed self-confidence, willingness and pleasure in play to the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to think about their strengths, and I stopped them to be more courageous, soul clipper Gross explained the so simple-sounding recipe for success that had no effect under the therapist Babbel.
He has sparked some magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "If a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury break, was the same as the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomenon" noted with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new supervisor works: "He is a man who demands through and discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
It was obviously missing from Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports director Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs mainly Constance.
Like Gross, players and managers kept guard against overvaluing the victory against a weakened and totally overwhelmed defense of Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the bad awakening came, Khedira recalled.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that while one seasonal goal was achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Herot was not celebrated on his 40th birthday even after his first home victory in three months was due to the events of the weekend, which were freshly lived in the form of a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann immediately before the game started.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, heroes opposed Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the management board of weaknesses and decided to change coaches on pressure from puberting fans.
Also that his free day had been deleted after the games, Lehmann considered as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disgust.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure egoism,” Heldt recalled and announced consequences for the final man.
They won't be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with all the others that without the preliminary work of the replaced coach team the playful and fighting strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said Herot and Lehmann unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
World Championship Fight in Heavyweight
Hot duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson always provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old WBC champion unanimously defeated American Kevin Johnson by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work with the K.O. that everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his score to 39 victories in 41 professional battles, he had to give up twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th fight.
Around 17,000 spectators at the Berner Arena, the 2.02-metre Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left hand.
The eleven-centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, nevertheless repeatedly deprived himself of the World Champion's beats, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to a decisive target.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beats rarely hit the World Champion.
After all, he was only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who walked with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had caused a whirlwind before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right."
Weighing the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and picked up "his" WBC belt, which he previously had to hand over without fighting.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got a hit in this fight and I am very well in physical form, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
But the WBA belt was worn by the British David Haye after he was able to unthrone the 2.13-meter Nikolai Waluev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
It is reported that his promotional company is already planning to fight Klitschko at the London Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz Fall
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar for false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left are calling for information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings about the Kunduz air strike, the opposition Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has submitted a deliberate deception.
The minister said on the deadly bombing of two tanker trains in September "knowingly the untruth," Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin said Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It’s commonly called this: he lied.
The order to kill was issued in disrespect of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the NATO report, which Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday it was announced that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted trucks, but also about targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the US air strike requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to the NATO investigation report.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy – and whether the Chancellor’s office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have endorsed this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor’s office had no influence on the concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the Ministry’s presentation on the backgrounds of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert were also voiced.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the backgrounds of the tanker attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of NATO reports and denied sensitive details to the minister.
However, from the surroundings of the two chief officials, they reported that they had even pointed to the Ministry of Defense on several reports, including a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification in a letter, the Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports.
He has not received an answer so far, he says.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the Bundestag investigation committee, which intends to constitute itself on Wednesday.
Traumwelt
Some see images in wakeful state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only for mentally ill people and drugs, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is okay.
When we lie with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we can unrestrainedly give ourselves to the wildest ideas and imaginations.
However, those who are experiencing traumatic states as they grow up, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world are usually considered crazy or drug-addicted, at least as a special boy.
But such images and voices arise not only in mentally ill or in drug noise.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, madness and reality blur.
Traumatically altered consciousness conditions can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic abduction states, psychoses and hallucinations can be attributed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain’s neuronal messengers – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – is disrupted and the interaction of different brain parts is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and mad thoughts occur very often during schizophrenia.
The gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection between madness and dream has been dealing with philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle perceived hallucinations as a form of dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great resemblance of irreality with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all these uncertainties, delusions, senses".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted fratters, teething.
They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Loud, malignant voices drone from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables from the stereo system, knots them to a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and lays the loop around his neck.
- Jump.
The loop is dissolving.
This is to be a teaching for you, the voices shouting in the choir of trumpet-skinning, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first is nearly 20 years ago.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffectional paranoid psychosis, in addition he is manic-depressed, he takes medications, anti-depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The deceptions are cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population has schizophrenia at least once in life, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenia, people who suffer from schizophrenia can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationships or persecution.
Voice listening is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Even optical hallucinations are not rare.
The affected person is no longer able to separate important from unimportant, the brain is no longer able to filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded by impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the locks for a flood of ideas and fantasies that derive from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subjected, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed to him.
At the same time, he becomes a passive role, he is overwhelmed, similar to in a dream, by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible for them, the deceitful images are cruel reality, waking out.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The insane thoughts and hallucinations are founded in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain strikes capriols still puts researchers before mystery.
Exceptional conditions can cause anyone to lose their reality reference for a short time, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the sole determinants.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, due to a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fox explains.
But there remains a mystery about how the disorder of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at first over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role – stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychosis when the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain is hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether deceptive images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and deceptions for ten years, last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychoses, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and cranial brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people are hallucinating.
Hallucinations, according to Box, are composed of memory contents that are normally retained.
They arise when brain areas in which sense perceptions are processed are overactive or inhibited too little; when our brain runs hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also irritation, stress, love suffering or other mental emergencies.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there weren’t pictures and voices.
During a break, a sleek boy with long, dark hair may address it.
When it responds, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a woven daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just like she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to herself.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
“Am I crazy?” she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other cheats are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are mostly frightening.
Often, the fools are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material because the teacher presents a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations to all others on the table.
At night, the appearances are mostly scary.
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which comes too rare and too late, she often can’t distinguish whether she’s awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the fratters or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
She doesn’t tell her parents or friends about it, they would think she’s crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She passed the high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted the psychologist on the Internet, she knows she’s not crazy.
Crazy is also an artwork of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from irritation withdrawal, they are highly likely to have hallucinations after a while, Kasten says.
I suspect that the brain is then underworked and provides for its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl was afraid of other children, often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she calls dad since she can think of is not her physical father.
With visual and acoustic hallucinations, the same areas of the brain are active, which also process real impressions and noises, it is hard for people like Sarah K. to distinguish deceptive images and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they look so real.”
Even night dream images value Box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their deceit as unreal.
Boxe therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our world of too much consciousness, imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful illness, but it also holds positive, creative - madness is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid experience form, a special form of traumaticly altered awareness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams which the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state even afterwards.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations related to trauma or disease, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example, by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world detached from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is impossible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in imagination.
An intense form of meaning foundation and meaning in a situation that is in itself unbearable, which allows us to be able to design our own people not to go down in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a salvation action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery, followed by a heart transplant, while his body is sentenced to motionlessness in the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into a self-made world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as an old man laying down on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs from blood.
Being taken by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
It goes completely up in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys differ fundamentally from every dream for Claussen.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are still unambiguous to me after years and in bilateral details.
More clear and intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizons of our other life-world experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations, and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the guard.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten, “can lead to a deformation of what we call reality.”
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children are to take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new publisher, Kallen, is an intermediate solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told Spiegel.
The holding is expected to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long run.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm willingness to enter the company, the 69-year-old told Spiegel.
We have precautionaryly regulated the details.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to offer 7,500 employees to their children if they are insufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the board of directors from January, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen appointed his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, Treasury took responsibility for the company’s assets and, after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, it also took responsibility for direct marketing, overseas, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publisher.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," Burda said.
The holding should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that even family businesses are not sure of the collapse: "This always affected families that were infected by a capital addiction, who had completely speculated and thought they could thus rise to the big player.
My strategy was never that.
He has never had “world power dreams,” Burda said.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the world league with 'Time', these shops have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has made, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is about personal care.
The wellness area, located on the eighth floor, includes other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide a laser hair removal; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many options that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a perfectly personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touch screen that is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your training sessions properly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warming and stretching exercises) are perfectly enough to train the body muscles.
And then if you want to visit the hair salon after training your body, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments to regain hair gloss, shine and health are offered for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this spa in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most varied decolletes
Christmas is getting closer and that is why it is again a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their wedding dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the decollette, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
Endesa has created the "LIVE Office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and agreements on mobility through managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and actions of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to drive forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among others, such activities that are related to energy and in particular to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative that Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company is involved in standardization groups across Europe and has a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of peace".
At the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again reminded us of the actions that the government has taken to support the automotive sector over the course of the rule year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants," he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the automotive manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the players in this industry, which is our largest export industry,” he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Overall Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), has provided €800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than €3 billion.
He said that these investments are intended both for the development of new models as well as for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government's actions to boost demand, in reference to the Plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the automotive manufacturers.
According to the head of the government, this plan allows to reduce exhaust gases in new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 percent" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Eco-friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportivity is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop-and-start system of the engine, named i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 stands out by its good scores in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good support.
The game of the steering wheel is also excellent.
Continuing to look at the unit, which consists of the instrument board and the dashboard, you can notice that Mazda has a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of the Honda Civic.
That is why it is easy to say that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to outperform.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can ride the most comfortably by car.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop-and-start system is so far only available for the 2-liter gasoline engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gear.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its finesse, quiet noise, performance and low consumption.
And all those who don’t travel many kilometres a year should consider this i-Stop with a gasoline engine due to its great gearing comfort and low consumption, even though Mazda’s mostly diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the trial ride is a special feature, since it has a substantially larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The main feature of the series is the RVM, which abolishes the dead angle, as well as the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors and Bluetooth 17o.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD-loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which ranges from €21,770 for the Luxury model to €23,270 for the tested model Sportive.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a new highest driving pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red pitch of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, radiated more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your e-mails without being able to see certain attachments or surf the internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose the magazine Time to be one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is of interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very affordable flat rate, for example, only half the price of an iPhone’s flat rate.
After seeing the success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free service for data, quite unlike the peek, where you have to pay a price six times higher.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, approximately 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to waive all the data in order to be able to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the country’s border or when you are desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctoral degree in physics and a good glasses to be able to read all the small prints.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for all of Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and that is right.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (while it’s always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer these types of rates means that phone providers need to slowly but safely rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, its prices include downloading books and other inquiries on the Internet.
Without vetage and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, namely when buying, not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I’m expecting from FonPeek one day, a lifelong internet shopping option that Peek already offers in the USA.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm reading my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a better model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
As soon as Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and coat of this color and re-choosed the same color to accompany him at his, without a doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same fabric, and she wore some large embroidered or a necklace.
On the first sight, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the model of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes differ very much in the type of fabric they are made from.
At the inauguration of the office, she wore a lace dress and in Oslo a velvet pattern.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with semi-high heels and the second time an annular model, but golden.
Even the hairstyle was different every time: the hair was put up as a hair crown on this occasion, the previous one she wore her hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of a study conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women on the "Fertility and Careers of Women in Spain".
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working women see their career opportunities limited in the labour market because of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are huge differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether or not women work and if so, what type of occupation they are exercising.
Those of them who do not carry out any other work outside the house, work only half a day or have no fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a fixed job, especially in the public sphere, are postponing the establishment of a family and maternity and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed job get their first child on average only 3.7 years after moving together, a number that has risen to 4.1 years for women with fixed jobs that have taken longer to achieve this and that have only achieved their moving together and the first child much later.
In addition, the type of labour has a great impact on maternity, although less than the calendar in terms of conception readiness,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the education level.
This difference can also be seen in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have a high school degree or a higher education, on average each were mothers with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with a major graduation marry before their first fixed job and have their first child, the women with a middle or high graduation do it exactly the other way around and first seek a fixed job and marry afterwards and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the popular advertisement "Because you are worth it".
The actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at the international level, will become another famous sign like before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish woman Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (actor colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to speak in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On that occasion, they all appeared.
The former model Jerry Hall and their daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) to the three-year X-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
In doing so, he does not use a predictable and fear-inducing genre (short biography, life, and work), but seeks a similarity to the burning heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent spares no horror or enlightenment.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading enjoyment, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
“When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: joy in contrast to evil destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any God.”
“Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, senseless, like the knife blade that almost killed him.”
“Our husband was drawn into her ban by this woman, with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery combined with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege which consisted of coming to heaven on the way of destruction.”
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, one of the 8,000 peaks in world literature, you have to climb the northern wall, the wall where the best climbers are constantly trying again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird cause.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir to a county estate owner and again again he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams bear witness to a certain greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer picked up the insane cry that was screamed out of a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo resonated deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary manner.
“One day she kneeled down and lay down, ‘My dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman.’”
On his tomb are engraved these verses of Spencer: 'sleep after effort, after the thunderstorm of the harbor, after rest after war, after a rich life one finds pleasure in death.'
Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she always had her depressions.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII spyed on them between the Azaleans or the birds sang in Greek.
No other case is known in which the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was even greater than her madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos, except trying to infuse Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet mean if he did not bring Barojah to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium?”
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the town of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 jumped next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we took out of the shelter and weighs only six kilos, and then they missed him two footsteps and wounded him heavily.
We cannot put our outrage in words, because it is incomprehensible for us, where the fun is supposed to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was executed on the leash.
In addition to that, a woman who walked comfortably, when she wanted to rebuke these people because of the incident, she was even afraid for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly master, or probably even anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog was crying all day long.
Of course, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts about whether this will at all contribute and in order to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our outrage over what happened has prompted us to report this incident.
We can’t understand what must be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack funny on a helpless animal, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin noted that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “encompasses far more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming more and more secure with each day” and reiterated that it also helps with other educational and informative actions to get a step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, running under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters in a first phase to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible spread.
In conclusion, Michelin emphasized that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because they always see themselves committed as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, which must be one of their main goals to develop ever-safer products.
Sales of small trucks are rising again
After almost two years, the car market for small trucks finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase ever after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer association Anfac and the auto dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be treated with great caution, as the reference data used for the comparison are for November 2008, which was a particularly poor deposit year with a 60% decline compared to the previous year.
However, it should be noted that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles that make up the minivan market: passenger cars, pickups, minivans, small vans and lighter minivans/carriages.
Furthermore, there are still the same clouds of thunderstorms in the sky that affect demand most, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in nearly 100% of cases make the purchase with third-party financing.
Thus, these restrictions, which are the consequence of the overturn of the funds of the credit institutions, must include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
With this panorama and unlike the passenger cars, the financial support has helped little in purchasing a vehicle of the plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, self-employed and small businesses also have a right to buy a small truck up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission that must not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Gangam reminded us that it is absolutely necessary for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (load cars and buses).
The auto dealership association predicts a similar year to the previous year for 2010, for which it expects a sales loss of 19% (for passenger cars and off-road cars).
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the anti-blocking braking system ABS and as with the stability control ESP now, the auxiliary braking systems in emergencies must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already obligatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the rest of the vehicles a currency period was set until the end of February 2011.
The action adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but because of their operation, these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which detects the system on the brake pedal on the basis of the brake strength executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even step on the brake pedal before the collision, and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels back during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents injuring pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistants.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents with personal injury could be prevented - as so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as small as possible.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel to January
While the workforce at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) was already informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to get the affected side to give its approval on every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision in the coming days regarding the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers might be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which is backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more encouragement.
In the absence of an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the foundation and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, so it now only brings 1,275 kilos on the balance.
In order to create such a thing, they first refrained from the automatic fold-up roof, which was replaced by a tent wall roof with manual drive, so that you saved 21 pounds alone; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by the exclusion of the air conditioning 13 times; furthermore, you refrained the fuel of 64 times.
Then, by renouncing the CDR-30 audio system, one had once again reached six kilograms less and by replacing the door handles with fabric handles the missing kilogram.
Although it is also available with the double clutch gearbox PDK, the trial ride was carried out with a 6-speed hand gear vehicle, mainly on California’s smaller land roads, on mountain tracks that were really very curved.
In his driving behaviour, he can only give him the note flawlessly.
The reduction of his weight, however, has under no circumstances led to the fact that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite case: for a long time we haven’t tested such a small and lightweight model, but at the same time gives you a sense of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the required time until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again...
The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, as communicative as well as precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all flavors
The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and you can increase it even more with the 'sport' option as well as a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing up or when accelerating again.
The springs are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads where we were driving with the Boxster Spyder was already pretty damaged, but the car mastered the bumper holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and that even though we found some of these curves ice at dawn and roll split in the morning.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it otherwise probably occurs rarely and there is much more in it than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl
The singer, a boob friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Cocoon cosmetics line and an occasional star at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her Chanel pockets.
Much more than “Bad Girl” or “It Girl,” she is a “Bag Girl.”
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated soccer field of the Maccabi Electra, reaching the first place in his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was eight times the best of his team (29 in the rating).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even though they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue reds, who sat at the top of the display board from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it was already guessed that they had come to the playing field with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were primarily responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the Álava team decided to play Barac's indoor game and the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with piping and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage to the break (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter already guessed that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was not yet decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that on their field not everyone wins, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elias" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellows" turning the rod (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, wounded but dead, had to prepare a few matches to get air again and one of them suddenly came up with Mirza Teletovic's gun, which with three nearly three consecutive quarters and with the support of English and Ribas could make sure that on the display board the calming distance of (54-67) was displayed at the end of the (54-67).
The Alaveses were blown up in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson did not resign, the best of their team, and tried to give their team back strength by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was dismissed because of faults, Ivanovic’s team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to give up the leadership in Group B of the Euroleague to him, in a game characterized by the failures on the part of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the inner game, which facilitated the Greeks' victory.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their first quarter game, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming, an aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of joining Unicaja, even though the native team with an indoor match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to have the display board in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor indicated the minute in which there was almost a fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action.
The Greek team finally got warm and his superiority on both sides, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces in the Unicaja.
Among their indoor players and Lithuanian preliminary player Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A recovery hunt was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to offset the difference of the match played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led the group to swing.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the exit of the Scottish injured during the game Robert Archibald.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to the spring guide and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis came back some hope on 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket range, was not to be braked.
In the 37th minute, Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to beat himself and had to give up the leadership to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook based on your profile?
Facebook users can now get their salary they should earn due to their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most advertisements of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a form on Facebook that allows them to enter their occupation, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish employee on average feels "poorly paid," explains the product manager for Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the least paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a French 31,059 euros, as opposed to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spanish.
Accordingly, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 euros in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros per year; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros per year.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President dismissed must leave the diplomatic representation at the latest by January 27, 2010, when his mandate expires officially.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV channel Globo that "Mel" knows he must have left the embassy in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he must find a new place to stay."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the fixed date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
Following the elections on 29 November (which won Porfirio Lobo), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
This, however, failed in Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the “de facto” government chaired by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the dominant mood in the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no case surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about an unsafe future by nature.
The measure applied to stabilize markets was to repay debt by direct purchasing assets and indirectly allow liquidity for interest moving around zero, so that banks can buy assets for accounting.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost completed and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policies, begin to pour some sand into the gear, as the ECB has already said with its annual auction to take place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are just witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
Exchange fluctuations and differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and public debt was rising again.
We are now relying on quality and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone with regard to Germany.
Spain has hardly been affected by this instability episode so far, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of Spain's rating.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who once again tried to create awareness among those responsible for global economic policy of what they caused, as they slowed down the devastating effects that the restriction of loans should have led to the loss of jobs, when they actually ended a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates and development in Greece was previously anticipated.
A government that hides public debt, elections, and a new government that pulls on the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin will save Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments earlier this year, thus allowing a euro member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into duty when it comes to the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, ahead of an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some depravities to too high amounts, which would now lie within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences diminish and the Spanish continue to rise, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the current indicators force a majority of market research institutes to prefer their recovery scenarios and to correct their 2011 scenario upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which are back with a long Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, this does not promise all.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, although "Cautious driving" is currently in trend.
Connected branches
Iberdrola Chairman Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to appear yesterday before the subcommittee of Parliament, where these days the strategy for Spain’s energy supply will be debated over the next two decades.
Following his appearance, Rafael Villaseca, chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, gave the press some highlights of what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion by 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants will continue to be in operation.
If this were not the case, the investments needed would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy capacity, but in distribution networks and international allies.
As of 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal plants with facilities for collecting carbon dioxide and, of course, mainly on renewable energy.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the prerequisite of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy just passed by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy policies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, "in the long run, this direction is clearly set, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Whatever it may be, Galán believes that the decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should be made already now, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets Aer Lingus' "handling" at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for services at airports on the ground, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish flu company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have yet been announced, is planned for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol to cooperate to create an innovation center for intelligent infrastructures.
The Alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the centre’s tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the authorization of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 kilometer long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The municipality plans to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration opted for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan prepared by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll administration.
In anticipation of the offerings presented in May, the investments are estimated at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing in the last phase.
The Transcity Group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second is based in Italy, one of the best underground engineering specialists.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure, and the French Bouygues consortium, joins the Acciona team.
The third and final consortium in the closer election is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises tremendous construction works and privatizations, but has an obstacle to overcome, as access is only obtained by buying a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, which has yet to be followed by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only by its 30 % stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona focuses on this geographical area of utmost importance for the industry, in which it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage the desalination plant in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll route, which is promoted by the Brisbane City’s Office of Infrastructure and is called Northern Link (Northbringer), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) in a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels.
The roadmap issued by the municipality provides for the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of construction works in December next year.
Although this toll line is expected to open up for traffic in the last months of 2014, construction works are expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland is participating in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia, which yesterday signed a 154 million contract with the government, has repeatedly awarded substantial contracts.
The sub-company ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables through its native subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide fast internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane, which has not yet started construction work and Hochtief has received 129 million.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools over 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has managed through its subsidiary Alpine to build a 2.1-kilometre tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of €64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the contract for the construction work to expand the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will last over 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore receives advertising status from Renfe
Renfe has attributed advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore over a sum of approximately three million euros per year, the railway company said.
Mrs Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies presenting this competition, 4 of which entered the final round, including TBWA, which was responsible for the advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be entrusted with the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom has been fined more than 63 million for slowing out competition.
France’s Competition Regulatory Authority has imposed a fine of over €63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behavior in the Caribbean regions of the country.
According to the authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition for landlines and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the brink of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state undertakings have accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, as the authority, which monitors competition, believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore been reversed again.
Application Trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet in order to increase revenue from non-telephone connections.
Basically, Orange's website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this seventh will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League match has made Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the beginning.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of income for the football clubs.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, bringing them to the third and fifth places of the football clubs that earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings with it fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for the major clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) who have participated in this event since its creation in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club ranks third in Europe, earning the most money from its participation and the only one to win the trophy three times next to AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup 1992 occupies fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money by participating in the last Champoins League.
And that even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third among the countries that were able to earn money through the Champions, although it has more titles than anyone else (five, unlike four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated funding procedure that UEFA is applying.
In this fiscal year, the organization, whose chair Michel Platini holds, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who won a competition received 3.8 million by their sole presence, in addition to the €550,000 for each game they denied.
There is also a bonus for winning (€800,000) and a draw (€400,000 per team). The clubs that have entered the eighth-finals each receive three million; the four that have entered the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second who earns 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club earns at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed revenue.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory in the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 places assigned.
Last year’s champion receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placed and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday leaked details on the offer to buy shares, with which it intends to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which is paid for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa rates the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jerez group gives shareholders a 15-day period to notify their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos reaffirmed that it had contacted the authority.
With a closure, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In an attempt to stay on the brink of possible purchase offers and the court queries of his former managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the head of the internal audit.
A decision to become the first woman to hold a high position with the food company.
This is a newly created position that is directly under the chair of the group.
This is anything but free of controversy because the company is involved in a court battle for suspicion of diverting more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will postpone further capital over the next few months.
In view of the Salazar loan yesterday, former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public tender for Paternina submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina submitted by investment company Mer on October 9.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this tender after it had been proven that the conditions comply with the legally valid laws and thus the content of the submitted declaratory leaflet, following the amendments of December 2, could be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the share capital, which consists of 6,142,786 euros in shares registered on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
Furthermore, it was reported that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the conclusion of the tender and whose price was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legally valid laws.
New Vehicle Review Programs
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops, where a reviewer has to assess the damages incurred and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes.
That’s why nearly 100% of reviewers use these types of systems.
Service and application providers for accident assessment and repair collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process it afterwards and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The other two companies competing in the tool market for reviewing and reporting are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is not easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Head of Sales at Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of whom provides the information in a different format.
Moreover, the volume of data to be processed is becoming increasing, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and engines came on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because every single one of the thousand vehicle parts must be catalogued and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphical image that allows you to "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a highly sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information for 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the car park running on the roads, it is more than 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and to produce databases, Audatex has eight centres distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical professionals) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, however, depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating a car's filament or residual value.
The only company that knows about a driver who knows about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution to monitor accidents for reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive is for customers who use it rarely, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
In contrast, every insurance company that produces thousands of expert opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can completely identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt, based solely on the chassis number.
AudaGlass is dealing with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the specialist market that can be offered for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or in order to obtain information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, we can investigate how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this kind of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides digital images in the same way, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damages, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Advisory Guide is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually over the past three years and in 2008 sales amounted to €10.8 million.
Earlier last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of which are in Spain.
The total sales in the world of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amount to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
Here, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are trading at a value of $2.4 billion.

Last October, the group Solera Autoonline bought a Plattfom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and increased value, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is intended exclusively for industry professionals, such as insurance companies, reviewers, car rental companies, workshops, scrap sites and car dealers, who must be registered before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site now has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
3,000 ads are managed daily and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis numbers have been unsigned may no longer drive on the roads, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
Cars of historical value, on the other hand, may be registered again, even if they have been unregistered after difficult administrative procedures.
Workshop estimate in four steps
With the tool Auda Taller, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding the spare part, creating and creating a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small trucks and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for working hours, surcharges or discounts and afterwards he can print the estimate and pass it on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not an evaluation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to be able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, because you can choose a door, for example, and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
