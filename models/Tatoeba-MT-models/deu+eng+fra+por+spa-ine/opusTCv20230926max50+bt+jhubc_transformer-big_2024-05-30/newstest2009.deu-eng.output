The Prague Stock Exchange crashes down against closing business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague stock exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ’s shares reached almost half of the normal day-to-day business.
The Prague stock exchange was linked to the fall on Monday at the beginning of Tuesday’s trades, as it fell another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the burglary was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of shares in Asia
A dramatic case experienced on Tuesday on the Asian stock exchanges, although the indices were able to offset part of the losses over the course of the day.
The index of the Hong Kong Hang Seng stock exchange lost nearly four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to compensate for some of the losses, thus decreasing to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which observed the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced losses to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market fell by 3.6 percent after the index.
“The timing for the U.S. rescue operation is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, chief of the monetary agency in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong determines, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the U.S. legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and approve the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will be affected by the invasion.
A Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion CZK) should be spent.
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would resolve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodshed on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest decline in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by nearly seven percent, with a similar drop last seen in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little evidence that the draft would not pass through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: U.S. government can pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators reached a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial aid to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
Congressmen have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated at the US Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to different data, the plan could probably be voted at the earliest on Wednesday.
According to economists, a notice that the plan is to be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "disappointment" due to the complicated mechanisms of how to help markets also in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg agency.
He said a final vote could be held on Sunday.
Legislators met with U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for the purchase of unsold mortgage assets from financial companies, which will plunge financial companies into serious losses and jeopardize the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective in the market.
We have to continue the healing plan even further, but I think we’re at the target,” Paulson said.
A Signal for Asian Business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are declining sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, legislators are striving to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This is to reassure investors from deals on the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a Congressional decision could affect business on Monday.
However, it is still not clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the negotiations at the last minute could fail to address a problem.
Legislators hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will undergo some changes.
The total amount destined to assist the system will be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
But Congress can block the disbursement of the remaining money if it feels that the program does not fulfill its function, at another $100 billion and later at the final $350 billion.
Bush says progress in negotiations is positive
While the President has a veto right in this decision, Congress can over-vote his veto.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the program, which was based on obtaining finances for the purchase of poor mortgage bonds whose value has dropped, has remained because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We’ve worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “appreciates the two-sided effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Limitation of golden parachutes
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said the legislators agreed on a responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the completion of benefits and a timetable for the plan’s financing.
The new law also aims to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and to set up a committee to oversee the fund.
This is to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it and made great progress towards a deal that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also expects help for homeowners who have problems with repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages that it buys off, with the goal of lowering the monthly costs for debtors and enabling them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"And that's because we don't know through which mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week is not crucial in Marek’s view.
“It’s more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and approve it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that an adoption is coming is the most important thing at this moment,” Marek said.
Duel on knife cutting edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still call.
So, of course, it looks like it’s better to just buy a phone.
Despite all this, there are enough reasons why you should buy an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
Surely it’s hard to buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one like that.
This is the same with music on travel, i.e. with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably hardly hold headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what cell phones can do doesn’t even create insignificantly.
No modern device can be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary features, phone calling and Simsing, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera, and maybe it can also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a little wonder, because no fridge can grill and no TV can take pictures.
But the universality of cell phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to recharge it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Only a few phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, mostly it’s much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more powerful.
That’s why you should expect cheap phones to be able to play music for no more than a few hours.
If you’re still on the phone from time to time, you’d rather buy a charger for the office for safety – this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the less good ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
Another problem is when you want to overplay the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a storage medium, but few card readers are done without reduction with the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
With players, you do not need special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most phones and players themselves create a music library, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only represent the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some may both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, cell phones can be more
When choosing a concrete device, you should inquire in particular about the battery life, the storage capacity, the quality and type of sound and, of course, also the comfort of operation.
If music is primarily backdrop for you and you listen to it every day for a brief time, for example, in the tram, then any phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost every cell phone can do.
You also don’t have to control what music formats a cell phone or player can handle.
MP3 create all, and most of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also allow you to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can already purchase a song or album.
This service can already be an argument in itself why you should buy a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that precisely this type of music sale (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most of them carry their cell phones.
If you want to listen to something, grab the phone in the jacket pocket while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless handsfree device.
If not, you can resort to the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the least MP3 players.
The biggest advantage of the music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no normal headphones.
The best and most technically mature phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players in turn lies in the lightweight operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the previously normal cassette recorder or, for example, the recorder, is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile internet and a subsequently horrific invoice for data transmissions.
Which device should you use
Even the cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But be careful.
Basic models usually support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8GB memory cards.
If you already own a phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then use Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB), you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Belong to the more sophisticated listeners, rather take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have standalone control buttons for MP3, and the convenience of operating can be matched to the one of a single MP3 player.
The farthest is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours) offer you MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Perhaps
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services as they are offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Perhaps he won’t be waiting longer.
The fact that Czech cell phone providers are working among the most expensive in Europe has been reported on Mobil.cz.
This was confirmed by the telecommunications agency ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of an SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
Following the European Commission’s last steps in the regulation of roaming fees, a paradoxical situation is likely – for some customers of Czech mobile providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that really makes a fighting proposition.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical that there are three mobile networks in the Czech Republic and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to complain that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák often agrees that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network doesn’t have a lot of chances anymore (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies either).
But there is another option – a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, to which the classical mobile providers also had to react.
Before companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were similar voices as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, it doesn’t take long to look for examples.
In February this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to work effectively, virtual vendors need much fewer customers than a classic vendor.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually stand out as low-cost companies – they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive offer of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half as cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-clichée target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and can trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating company of this virtual provider.
It is hard to say whether a similar concept could take foot in the Czech Republic as well as in Poland.
Vodafone’s press spokesman Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual vendors are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service offering.”
In the Czech Republic, mobile providers say
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, it will not be mobile.
"While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look particularly hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries of our region,” said Jana Studničková, press spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, in a phone call to Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, she confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
Its interest in launching a virtual mobile provider has already shown for a long time the GTS Novera group, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve progress in the negotiations,” said Pavel Kaidl, the group’s press spokesman.
Maybe better times are coming.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment we do not expect that there is room in the Czech Republic for a full-fledged virtual provider.
The Czech market has large specifics compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and reputable project in this area,” says in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2.
Other providers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile’s press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová rarely agrees with O2’s statement: “So far, we haven’t found a viable and beneficial project on both sides to build on.”
And she adds: “In the T-Mobile network, hardly any virtual provider will appear by the end of the year.
At this moment we would have to have a concrete offer in order to be able to think so shortly."
Vodafone focuses its attention more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of division of costs and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we see as the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the suppliers hand in hand
The approach of the mobile providers is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, which would lead to declining prices and thus to a decrease in profits.
So why should one make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull on a string when it comes to something also proves the long go and go about the emergence of U:fon.
Perhaps the strongest pressure towards ČTÚ came from the company T-Mobile at the time when U:fon came on the market.
This is evidenced by the information available to the public from the ČTÚ websites.
Now, however, U:fon is suitable as an argument why one should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, in view of this approach of the mobile providers, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulators is amazed.
This is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which unfortunately does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in Czech, unlike in the UK and other highly developed countries.
It is exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to his very typical attitude to this whole problem.
“The entry of a virtual mobile provider on the market would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider on renting the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, as the offer of potential prospects was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic suppliers,” said Kristián Chalupa, from the Department of External Relations of the UOHS.
From the representatives of the providers, such a formulation would not surprise.
This is more than worrying by an authority to represent consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position in the market.
In particular, when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it is observed that their entry to the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
Probably, however, pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction do not belong to the interests of the UOHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile carriers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely equal gasoline price at the gas stations is surely only coincidence and the consequence of a harsh competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this matter indicating action against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions in the market.
“The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to be missing from the telecommunications regulator,” Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators hold a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different perspective - for a virtual provider to enter the market it is always necessary to obtain the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not follow this argument, it should at least be a warning for the UOHS that three mobile carriers act strikingly similarly.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) demonstrate that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act failed to enforce the extension of ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of professionals had promised to improve the situation.
The UOHS representatives need to know this too well, but they probably have other interests.
It can be done when no one looks
First of all, the functioning of some pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, is not considered.
It is companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but that are only partly public.
These are usually companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special pricing offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, it can be a violation of the contractual terms, which we will then deal with, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the corresponding company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not be talked about with the responsible of the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such an action.
Indeed, profits from the activities of these companies do not flow to them to be negligible, at the same time they are not affected - unlike the actual virtual providers - by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite the fact that the services of these companies are used only by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone doesn’t run on their name, so they can’t have it fully as the normal customers of the mobile providers.”
But this alone should at least seem strange.
Another question is opened for the UOHS.
If mobile providers close their eyes before such an action, why do they lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has fairly strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not wish, it does not have to satisfy the providers’ statement that they would not know anything about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As the text has already emphasized several times, the entry of virtual vendors on the market led to a significant price drop in the various services.
In virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence virtually more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies intervened in these moments, which by no means tried to safeguard the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether it was through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and further followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are taking the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that uncertainty in competences is more than favourable in these cases.
But let’s not throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile market may soon get back in motion.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other prospects.
And then the Czechs will finally not call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech State Day, presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where my home country is.
The hymn was newly recorded by the National Theatre’s orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female solo singing, in choral recording and in an instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took over the song.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server, you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems.
Earlier he told Czech radio that he had selected for the solo singers with young, representative voices that are distinctive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear diction with both of them and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that it can be harmonized," says the conductor.
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj first sounded in 1834 on the stage of the stand theatre in the originally Czech piece Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music originating from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first strofe of the song became an organic part of the national anthem after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
What the "new" anthem sounds like
The Prague transport companies also transport on a chip on Wednesday for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague’s transport companies as a date on which the first passengers who carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket will enter a metro, tram or bus.
These can currently be purchased by about a hundred thousand people who own the OpenCard chip card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it simultaneously played on their chip card at the information centers and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holeší, Andýl, Rozty.
The coupons are also available since yesterday via the Internet on the websites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sales can really forget the output window at the metro stations, where they had to wait regularly for their paper tickets in long queues so far.
They buy the coupon over the internet, which is played on the open card at one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these locations, travellers are also provided with a desk with trained staff, which advises interested parties on internet purchases and also plays the coupon on the map," says project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, you can also place the electronic coupons on the open card on self-service machines, which are attached in some subway vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, reminded of ticket deductors, the passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five in the city, but by the end of the year it is expected to be eighty," added Opatrný.
The coupon is controlled by an automated machine instead of the driver.
Operating the machines that will work from tomorrow is easy.
All you have to do is introduce the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays on its own.
Electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area from tomorrow.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mostly the inhabitants from the municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia reach the capital.
“In the trains that belong to Prague’s integrated transportation, the train attendants have readers that allow them to check the validity of the coupons by time and zone,” explains Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which compiles the schedules for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout with the driver.
On boarding, the chip card must not only be displayed to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked place on the side of the checkout.
Thus, the driver controls the validity of the coupons played.
“If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played, nothing is easier than asking the driver for this information,” Drápal said.
A passenger who does not drive on suburban buses and does not know when the coupon ends, can in turn go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played up on the map.
Here the information on the validity of your documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudets called for a referendum from the United States
In 1945, the Sudet Germans had requested the association of the Bohemian Forest with the United States.
This is evident in a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a desire in 1945, some groups of Sudet Germans were supposed to have turned to the US president.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter asked the US president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units will not enter German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” he said in a letter signed with the words “People whose fate is at heart.”
Since the connection with Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudet Germans, aware of the Czech national character, would expect brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to assume protection over the Bohemian forest for today and forever.
“We cannot believe that without regard to the view of a quarter-million inhabitants of this territory, you have pleaded to a foreign state for us that oppresses and attempts to eliminate minorities and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of revenge cravings of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would suffice if he would initiate a referendum in Bohemian Waldgau on whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the U.S. or live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naïve in today's knowledge of post-war history, it, in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses, draws a good picture with regard to the expectations of the Sudet Germans at the time.
Although at least the Bohemian Germans had to guess that they would negotiate their deportation from the Republic, few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some were waiting for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who comes from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German with the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he arrived in British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prison of war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would fit them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war he believed would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
This would also be the characteristic of the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš <0xC5><0x98>ebíček’s authority promises to deter drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, the internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to remove drivers from too fast driving and alcohol at the wheel.
And also remember to tie up before starting the ride.
The campaign aims to speak to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign also testifies to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "think not" are in large letters on a license plate.
In a blood laugh there is the word “pay.”
This means that you can pay a moment of carelessness with your own life.
The spots will “shock” the spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is promised that this will reduce the number of accidents and the number of road deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar bread and whip for drivers
"For drivers, the motto is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that if you drive red, for example, you save time.
The whip is the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk,” says traffic psychologist at hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that’s why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Even less effective are, in his opinion, boards that alert drivers to a danger.
“If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will likely flow into the surroundings soon, and the drivers will no longer notice it,” Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has voted in favour of the return of virtually all the territory occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be concluded with Palestine and Syria in exchange for it.
He stressed this in an interview printed by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all at all," Olmert told the newspaper.
“We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to hand over a similarly high percentage to the Palestinians (Israeli territory) because there will be no peace without it,” he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
“Those who want security in Jerusalem, and above all, do not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over their legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to waive a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said, referring to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Templars and holy and historic places" that lie on the territory of the Old Town.
“Those who want to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he said.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert said.
“The Syrians only know too well what they have to do without in order to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to waive their current relationship with Iran; they will have to waive their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to waive the constant support they provide to terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the jihad in Iraq.
Question after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance bus is not allowed to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to run back and forth on the bus while driving.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law,” said the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident that killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
The young woman sat at that moment to all unfortunately next to the driver, in the least secure place in the car, although she had two more seats available.
But a bus can also have an accident or sharply brake when the steward outputs coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing places after the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided in the bus, the travellers must sit.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses do not have standing spaces, which the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this first did not agree with the movement of travellers.
Later this was taken back, and we reached a consensus that travelers may go to the toilet while driving, if they have their seat," he said.
The law knows no steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legal provision that prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The road traffic law only knows the term vehicle companion, but its rights and obligations do not define it,” said the spokesman for the Hanzelka Ministry.
The Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this issue later.
“It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product license.
That’s all,” he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing spaces and maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing spaces and a higher allowed speed, and long-distance travel buses without standing spaces at the highest allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
Like on the plane, the expert says.
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP Traffic Safety Specialist, sees no fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
“With a fluid driving mode, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Here, too, it’s not sure when turmoil will come, and the stewardess can hit her head.”
“But if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in a city bus or tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations,” he says and also believes that this problem is not fully resolved from the perspective of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to provide stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider their occupation to be risky even after the accident.
“But as soon as I get the impression that the steward’s profession is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by travellers on board.
That would also reduce the costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewards, but we’ve been fighting from the beginning.
Sooner or later this ends with some fatal accident,” he told Týden.cz not entirely a year ago.
It was an incredible tragedy.
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the region of Pilsen, who had worked for the company for two years, was accidented.
The Slovenian truck was probably turned off the stand without blinking and had blocked the bus from traveling.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
The two seats were sold to the stewards, Jančura denied.
"These places cannot be reserved for distance connections, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but a financial compensation will also be expected from the guilty person.
A law change?
Not in view
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring about a statutory regulation on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport is already working for more than a year.
“However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones while driving,” says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the stewards' activities to be something that could significantly jeopardize the safety of travelers," Hanzelka said, while controlling the safety of the buses lies in the competence of the police and occupational safety agencies.
Dusseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no lack of big words in the letter from the WestLB Board to the House’s employees.
By merging units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstitut with the Frankfurter Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be formed, the letter announced on Monday.
WestLB would introduce a "competence block" with sustainable income power into such a business.
And in general, such a link could be the decisive driving force to further bundles in the state banking sector.
This is how it is read when a board of directors wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
The WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision, which the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia has only recently made it clear that the time is urgent to find a future solution.
However, WestLB has been talking about a kind of connection between the Deka-Bank, which savings bank customers know because of its investment funds, and WestLB for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas made it known when presenting the half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as the Helaba or WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each half supported by the Landesbanken and Sparkassenverbände, has commissioned the Board of Directors to hold discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could involve the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks, it is said at the financial center, have just begun.
The Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers at Finanzplatz Frankfurt, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a moment that the Deka-Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Helaba.
However, nothing came from this three-party covenant.
As soon as the plans had been made public, the Hessian state government opposed the participation of the Helaba.
The other two houses did not find each other either.
Instead, the Landesbank Rhineland-Palatinate went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have been repeated thought games about a connection of the deka bank with state banks.
Günther Merl, chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, had recently opposed plan games about meeting with his house.
Regardless of this, however, the realization seems to mature that a collapse of the various houses of the public-service sector is in need.
After the Landtag election in Bavaria is over, the first thing that could be a connection between the BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure on further mergers increases, the partners will gradually assume it.
In the south, she would only be a junior partner, although she has so far endured the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
In turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is an 85% stake in the Helaba, set a barrier earlier this year.
At least the North LB remains.
Such geostrategic considerations, however, are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses match one another.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question of which business model should be used to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken had not yet been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of the West LB, which, of course, is not desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the board of directors there, it is also stated that there is definitely a “general solution” for the House.
How this brings the merger of individual units with the deka bank under a hat will be shown.
The second meadow weekend is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so it's all different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built beardier and proves to the about 200 Oktoberfest travellers how deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a kiss first, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus car park next to the Puorta Nuova station, this evening at 11:45 p.m. four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", are expected to arrive at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are reserved for Italians, only Brazilians travel on a bus.
In a corner of the car park, South Americans sing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loudly, Marco Guarda says, that's not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur lining and a glasses with wide silver irons, includes the buses.
For five years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, three tours alone this year.
Night, daytime on the Wiesn, back at 10:30 p.m.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the trip, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Beer, brewed faithfully to the Bavarian Purity Order, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There is no beer yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, travelers sleep.
Well, they will still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where many other buses with Italian license plates on highway 8 just before Munich take a break again.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at midnight in the morning, the other 50 buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow hood.
On the left there is "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's running!" Marco calls into the morning.
"Run!" Running and occupy the seats in the rear part of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we will block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, spread in the room!"
The measure, screams Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget tips.
"The security officers are showing that we behave well.
As soon as you leave the seats, you're gone!"
Thirdly, "Today night point at half eleven come back here!" Understood?
And now we're going to the Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be prepared for the retreat.
It is the second meadow weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There are no details on the numbers; it is talked about 50,000 who are heading over the Alps and falling into the beer tents, 10 percent of all visitors are expected to have arrived extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, while Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts a nation statistic in which Italians take first place in front of British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical care.
Especially popular among Italians is the Hofbräuzelt.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said last week.
It’s good that the politician used the word “relative” and also insisted that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis developments.
This happened on the weekend.
The Munich real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) listed in the Dax receives a billion loan from a consortium of German banks to shield himself from the turmoil in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate has to pay only the part it also takes advantage of.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financer had refinanced himself for long-term projects for which he lent money – which is no longer possible because of distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve declined by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio also declined slightly from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year period, while income from bonds and certain securities, as well as from the dissolution of provisions in credit transactions, had fallen by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher income from reimbursements of downstream transfer costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from reimbursement of interest in accordance with the tax rules and from the management of businesses for group companies, the income decrease was still moderate at around 16 percent.
The former state financer had initially speculated after his privatization in 1990 with commercial real estate loans, which had then been separated out at Aareal Bank.
Because of the low earnings in classical state financing, the Depfa was then increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciations that will have a "substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it hot quite indefinitely.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
In 2007, it was cut by two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financer since the acquisition of Depa.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, loan leasing among banks is again largely drying out as banks raised their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funding to refinancing a portion of the Depa’s loan portfolio annually – around 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered with the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded “from the influence of the currently largely inoperative international money markets”.
It can be heard from other sources that thanks to the funds the refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to take advantage of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is hopeful for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that the funding does not have to be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be worn out either.
After hearing that the bank was still before bankruptcy late Sunday evening, the at least provisional rescue cannot also calm the minds.
The stock price drops by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond prices are quite good.
While the priority debts are scarcely moved, the rates of subordination bonds are more pronounced.
The bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the maturities beyond 2009 are particularly affected.
If hypo-real estate bonds appear previously to be a speculative investment alternative, their sustainability must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and of the institution itself, which had only taken the crisis into account with the takeover of the depfa.
As long as central banks, governments and less struggling commercial banks are ready to support the system, a timely payment of the pensions can be assumed.
Or it happens what hardly anyone else can hope at the moment – that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports that overlap with the partial nationalization, the probability adjacent to security has now become just a legitimate hope.
This is likely to prepare some sleepless nights for long-term creditors to decide whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can use a closing indent anyway to form a loss statement for future payments of compensation taxes on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself to Tachibana High School on the first day of school, the girls begin to chick: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Before I went to school, I had bamboo.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of lessons does not seem to be as strictly defined at the Tachibana as we are at home in Lower Saxony.
The students will run from eight o'clock until a short round of meetings begins at twenty ahead of nine with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lessons started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I’m not the guy who likes to talk to people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt of my guestmother, plus a blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the bar and tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language just about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all smiled, squeezed and swollen and I have always heard the word "kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, cute'.
Then I quickly hunted into my seat.
The girl next to me smiled quite widely, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really beaten.
Everyone was talking confused and whispering and asking holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, all of their Bentos were packed out.
My guestmother had also made such a lunch box for me - that's something other than the deserted German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and some kind of meat in the tofu coat.
I usually don’t know what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salted plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared Bento, which she then prepares especially artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy closer at the break snack.
I read this in my manga comics.
I'm curious if I can watch this, too.
‘Why exactly Japan?’ my girlfriends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said,
"Because it fascinates me."
After all, I have been reading manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started learning a little Japanese at some point.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
For I also have a weakness in tradition, customs and customs.
And that's what you're putting a lot of value on here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats have feelings too.
Does a rat or sheep flee in danger mean that they also feel fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we see if they feel the same when they behave like us?
The internet magazine "Edge" has been publishing contributions from famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove this so far where we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and address questions of feeling, or generally of consciousness, we enter inevitable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it stands dead, flees, or attacks.
People behave similarly, which some scientists suggests is a similar subjective experience.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in the execution / control functions).
This broad region is much higher developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely missing from other creatures.
At least with those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: since so much of his experience is linked to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever it may be, probably differs very much from most of our consciousness states.
This is why it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it is not possible to measure or analyze, because of the special hardware, on the basis of our own experience, then his exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of my speeches refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which should be more scientifically accessible.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, we rely more on the neural correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the achievement of visualization.
What is the result of the sensations?
I draw them back to the fact that an emotional system like the one of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies work memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and in particular humans.
Connected with the linguistic nature, fine levels of sensation arise because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio says that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-sensitive regions of the cortex and brain stem arise similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may be involved in cross-gender sensations.
Purely theoretically, I cannot oppose this, but I think it is unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears like fear in rats and humans probably feels like this in both cases: But how can one check whether rats and humans feel the same if they behave similarly?
Does a sting flee in danger if she also feels fear?
In my eyes, pure behavioral similarity cannot prove equality of experience.
Neural comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain strains, but scratching doesn’t even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this for humans, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even shreds (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their sensations probably differ fundamentally from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, there is progress on the neural level, as long as rats and humans measure the same.
How I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, even feelings, I do not know if they exist.
You may think this is short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than walking against a wall constantly.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees the decision of the UEFA in Bordeaux as a proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to host the EM together with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there is still much to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or renovation of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts fall behind.
Even the number of EM stages may be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste time anymore.
We have to work at maximum speed now," Ukrainian President Grigory Surkis said.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us constantly."
An even more radical move was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
“We assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparations for the 2012 EM will not suffer.”
Several first league players had been sentenced to forced descent in the past season alone for manipulation, eventually even the league start had to be postponed for a short time.
Angry Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new movie, spoke in an interview about Privates - and now has trouble with the ex-Hollywood star Meg Ryan outfitted her ancestor Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
The foam - and beats back.
Late Rose War with ex-married Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now have an unpleasant dispute with each other - in public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The scale of the fraud was only discovered after the divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband came out clearly: "It's monstrous," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News that "Meg repeatedly chews and reverses the history of our relationship."
“It is also regrettable that the 16-year-old son Jack is once again publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals that mean a divorce for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
And so his admissions close with the side cut: "My life goes on at least.
I’m happy I have a wonderful family that’s doing well.”
Prices of airline tickets and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than last year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and noted a significant drop in the second quarter following a price increase in the first quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already declined.
From January to March, prices in 41 of 48 European cities surveyed still increased by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a cause, American Express sees the weak dollar rate, which led to a “decreasing travel desire of American tourists.”
Financial sites such as Frankfurt or London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with a 26.3 percent rise.
Even for airfares, the trend in the first quarter was still upward:
Due to kerosene relief, travelers in the economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class air tickets decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first-class prices were much lower.
In Germany, prices dropped even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices rose 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, according to the study, prices have even fallen in half.
The reason for the price drop is, on the one hand, the decline in economic growth, the company explains.
Demand is crumbling in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the deletion of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – 24 airlines alone in Europe.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the table leader.
At Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a working eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein enlarge breakdown for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher arrived late in the game and failed with a lifter to the latte.
His message was precisely formulated, it convincingly passed over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," whispered Hermann Rieger in the cabin gate of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the mid-time break was over and most sat back in their seats.
Rieger was an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades, enjoying a higher reputation than many past actors.
And so his request was heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol knocked and raised the thumb.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s chief coach Martin Jol.
His command will have been similar: Here with gate two!
The implementation was stopped.
“There wasn’t everything to look at today,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have "more relaxed."
The 1:0 (1:0) was due to Mladen Petric's headball strike (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers couldn't hurt the weak hamburgers.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV turns 121 this Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their club as a class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify this," said Marcell Jansen.
He guessed that the tabular interim certificate represented more the unpredictability of the league than the dominance of his HSV.
The team, with their late entrances - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and the Jansen deployed by FC Bayern - is slow, but can't shine too much.
“We need more flair and more dribbling,” Jol said.
After the defeat of the vote
On Wall Street, the fear is over.
First news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to break by 700 points at a time.
This was the biggest loss of points in one day in his history.
Later, the Dow caught something.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock exchange barometer ranked at 10,579 counters with a less than five percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was more than seven percent down at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at that time was the Dow American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could be added.
Bank Goldman Sachs shares dropped by nearly 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, large investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds will be provided for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage documents.
But the sum is not to be paid out at one stroke, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock options from financial companies, which could be redeemed in the event of a corresponding price development to reduce the burden on the state’s cash register.
Stock prices in Europe and the United States
The billions of dollars for banks in Europe and the U.S. do not resolve investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German Großbank Hypo Real Estate crashes and tears down the Dax.
The US Dow Jones Index is losing despite the state’s planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have deepened the German stock index (Dax).
The share of the Munich real estate financer lost three quarters of its value temporarily despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank dropped by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clearly below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and scored with a less of 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Worldwide stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion rescue package could not be enough to revive the financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first trading hour to 10,809.25 points.
The House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan that the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE index initially dropped by 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese lead index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 meters after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng Index fell by 2.1% to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the lead index Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 meters.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor dropped after an announcement of an increase in capital.
Privatbank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused dismay: Dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by manoeuvres.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory might not be quite correct.
Almost 18 years ago, the spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space.
Due to soon-freezing fuel lines, you are now threatened with the cold pad.
For years, among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion – the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
As a result, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprised about for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected by the ancient gravitational law.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They named him swing-by anomaly.
Some experts worry that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general relativity theory, which describes the attractiveness of matter by curving space, might not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be located very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers have known about the existence of dark matter only for about ten years.
It obviously comes from an attraction, the effect of which can be observed on other celestial bodies.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not transmit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially not visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, dark matter makes up well one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt are expected to be free again, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded several million euros of ransom.
In a shooting before the release, six hostage captors were reportedly killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Redemption negotiations are already underway.
Germans are repeatedly targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arabian television channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released.
We are checking her health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions are safe and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom,” the official said.
It was "just about taking hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "leads to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has caused a woman to kill herself, a court has reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after he confessed to eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court found that Ms. Randle killed herself at her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and tied her eyes before he performed sexual acts while her mother was away to work at a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked a large part of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust, was prosecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney Ramsay Quaife told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been an eager surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "given up her life".
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by choking herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended up as follows: “I used to bind her and connect her eyes.”
“I didn’t force her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her victim it must have been frightening, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim’s suicide.
Worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if she had not done so.”
He added: "I take note of the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, their action over the years had on her daughter.
She would have otherwise clearly been a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet officer, who lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged under the “Public Security Act.”
The man was deployed by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intention.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought it would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be given is charged under paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the safe retention of information.
The Royal Prosecutor's Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he posted contained classified reviews of Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies see B&B costs in eye
British housing companies could cost more than 80 million pounds after rescuing Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies receiving money from investors, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies (BSA), said it was "unbearable" that the companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loans will ultimately be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is counted annually to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The program to compensate for financial services confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now called upon to take on some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest rates on the loan will be <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies must raise 81 million pounds for the interest rates of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate recovery are now called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
“We will look at all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives are there to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
Interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be nearly twice as much.
Since construction companies are bilateral organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Milk Costs Five Pence Per Liter
The people in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after research from a consulting firm has been conducted.
Retailers must decide themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Prior to the price rise in February, the wholesale price of Jersey Milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh refused bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a request for caution from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said the court refused deposit regarding the charge for chanting 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released earlier this month on deposit.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, called for the transitional government to grant her unrestricted freedom.
The correspondents say that although her detention was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear, as part of her release, whether she will continue to remain on her feet if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's deposit request because it says she does not need to be granted a deposit because she is already on detention suspension abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the Supreme Court.”
Her lawyers claim they need a deposit to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance party president said on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-supported transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears about the anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations said.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder thousands of employees carrying out vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeal Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB’s share distorted competition and enabled it to have an unfair influence on ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL from buying ITV, now renamed Virgin Media.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BskyB’s purchase of the share of ITV raised doubts about ITV’s independence, which led the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the communications office of Ofcom have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that reducing pressure on ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB announced that he wanted to give up his voting rights.
New Investigation in U.S. Prosecutor's Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to deal with the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Justice, criticizing the actions of the administration staff.
The report criticized the White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been discontinued for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officials interrogated during the investigation lied to the investigators to hinder justice.
Serious allegations including criminal action have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appeal of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which prompted many observers to consider the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-level Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the Democratic election fraud allegations.
U.S. prosecutors are commissioned to investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was shot under fire over the dismissals and has ultimately resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
The Inspector-General's report has particularly critically addressed the role of Gonzales by bearing the "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, "releasing" his leadership role and showing himself "extraordinaryly disinterested" in the process.
Other officials, including former senior adviser to President Bush, Karl Rove, were criticized for their lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will receive his special gold award next week in London during the ceremony, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" lists the nominations for this year's prize awards after having come into closer selection in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of Q Magazine Paul Rees said there are some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and has reached 15th place in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years on the charts and sold over 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years, one of which was an irregular heartbeat surgery in 2003 after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his voiceband.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and possibly for sale soon
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side roads and other circumferential roads, some of which are famous and others only convenient.
Nevertheless, it is difficult for even experienced taxi drivers and long-term residents to say where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in East Village and runs from First Street north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an active passageway.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
It intends to re-pave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshippers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the block’s past.
However, the city administration, which is responsible for the protection and construction of residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the municipality and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the construction company’s purchase of the road.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district official in the municipal council 3.
“Very little space remained in the city’s ownership and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
“There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to it to be guaranteed.”
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it will re-pave the small street and set up seats, which are designed for a cafe that the company wants to rent space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this fallen alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street, emphasizing that the department’s task was to develop real estate rather than manage it.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split between its numerous children and a narrow stripe of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock memorial, which was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is certainly best known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The street was full of scrap, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Disappearing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic Look at the Extinding City"), has published part of the conversation of the city's history about Extra Place, which was published in the magazine "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow blind alley that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rushed metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and flying weekly newspapers past raintrees."
With few exceptions, the street looked exactly as recently on one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing shop.
Graffiti were seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of exhausted newspapers.
Some passengers said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be polished somewhat.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the street in its current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, wet, and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: education in an English-language environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior academic staff in Caliphonian Studies and senior director of educational sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Appealing to the Spanish voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood among African-American and Hispanic students of successfully completing school is lower than among white students”—which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s educational plan specifically recommends a bilingual transitional period in education for those who are learning English.
Nevertheless, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance in school performance.
Take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Spanish and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, are learning English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of fourth-class students passed the state examination in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of the fourth-year school children were rated as well in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
School Sixth Street focuses on review and exercise, on steady control of knowledge and an attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach of training in an English-speaking environment, which is precisely the point that Obama should note, says school leader Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the specialized lessons.
Ms. Mikels, who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico.
“It works,” she said, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s achievements would make it easy to answer this question, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national image unions have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While agreeing that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop worrying about “English-only” legislation.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child knows Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work, rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices drop as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The oil price on Monday fell strongly due to fears that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets could not be sufficient to revive the economy.
Crude oil deals on the New York Stock Exchange fell 7 percent in the morning session to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both financial turmoil on Wall Street and heavy storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they dropped to nearly $90 per barrel this month, then rising again, as a result of enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Investors were worried again on Monday, despite congressional representatives announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan this weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis is still far from being completed.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government statement on Monday, Citigroup is expected to buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appears to have failed to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to worsen, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to decline further.
Analysts from Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption down due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and have lowered their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Center defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after running in the last eight and a half years more often than anyone else in the jet shirt.
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter, in which the jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphal move.
“I’ve never seen anything like this before,” Ellis said.
After a sluggish match between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter started.
However, when quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, this marked the perfect start to an afternoon where their evolving collaboration made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in that neighborhood for two more touchdowns, one slipping as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
"I haven't been very hard," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
“He’s a super player.
“Our vote has voted no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Cole played catching, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner split up.
External defender Darrelle Revis captured an accidental throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith arrived at another passport and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game as the jets regained the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
Those were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On both responses, because the jets left 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Relaxed Gebrselassie Beats its World Record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown again why some believe him to be the best long-distance runner of all time after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to manage the 42.2 kilometer track in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous score of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he achieved at least one World Championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie dropped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing that air pollution could exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions – at sunlight and 9 degrees at start and 13 degrees at target – Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since the long-distance trail runners Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat have changed from Kenya, the record time for the Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and was therefore unable to train for a week.
Obviously he was refreshed after a break and not rustled back.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I started training again a week ago and I still had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great.”
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - for over-orchestrating his races, avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a track race, and setting world records over the competition.
However, this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrasselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the speedmakers slowed down.
Slightly more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last move to separate from Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi was third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, completed a remarkable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing due to problems described as back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has skillfully planned her run by first pulling out a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but overtaking after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the hardships in the lives of the black people, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden among the outbreaks of the amusement parks in the outskirts of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic drives, lies a quiet town where the pride and complications of African-American culture come to light.
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurstons, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet pitches, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guava, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination by including it in the Florida Travel Guide, produced by the Federal Writer Project at the time of depression – is and remains in many ways a place of the very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, generous and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even nowadays, in a year in which a black presidential candidacy, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial conditions, many here are still sick of being watched by outsiders.
“We are very careful about how our history is told,” says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a member of the town’s oldest church.
It must be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the country’s average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and watchful.
And that's how the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in words, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Freak like Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Beyond the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white painted modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and what-always-fits hours."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things as they were,” said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls, who eternalized the Hurston by quoting the men singing songs about their beauty full of sexual allusions.
She added, “Some people didn’t like this.”
Here, Hurtson is still remembered as a lively eccentric who regularly returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city, she usually did it without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and clothed in pants, in a city that itself today imagines something on her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added as he swinged in his chair, on a back-facing terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were lost.
Together with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great memorial, no public readings in a large style.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution to the world or their heritage at all,” says Valerie Boyd, author of Wrapped in Rainbows, a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to set a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the municipality's slow two-lane main road.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts.
The proposal was submitted as Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixture brought hatred into the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the people sitting away,” Mr. Franklin said.
“There was even a woman who was killed in the process.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to force integration, calling its decision in Brown's case against the school council "insulting instead of respecting my race."
Nowadays, residents say that although the abolition of racial separation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being hugged - I remember - they hugged their teacher in the morning and hugged their teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
She added that this could be maintained for as long as teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"We didn't embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap," Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped create space for more Zora Neale Hursttons – black writers, actors and artists who overlooked prejudices, just like she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, “How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker set out on her way to Hurst's nameless grave and began fighting for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found on the book shelves, and made it again part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came exactly at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter once again stood in the light of the public.
And this time, Hurst's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston Festival to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return every January for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road plans.
“The plans of a five-lane highway lived the city, accelerated the whole thing at peak speed, awakening real citizen pride,” Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There were more and more railroads, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who went to church here since 1993, and locals began to reappreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville remains a peculiarity in Florida: just 6 miles from Orlando’s city centre, it can sometimes feel like a back lane in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black nowadays.)
Foreigners looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, permission is necessary in advance and certain things – such as the wall painting of Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white one and representing black men in field work – must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time as the Hurston Festival grew bigger, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and laborious, silly and mixed as any other race and people group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, which he says might need some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most of the people who just go through here will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after church.
“But if you actually stop and look at your history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York we speak fluent financial latin.
At first glance nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the newspaper stands and the huge television screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t even notice that they are in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass façades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York have the worst horror workday every day since the 1929 stock market crash.
Suppliers still push the metal tea carriages along sidewalks with loud flaps and carry trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still swirl between apartments, like human packed animals loaded with the 50 ironed t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for themselves to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 a.m.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon I decided to open a new savings account because of the end of the world.
Even though I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon at my JP Morgan Chase headquarters, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the cash desk to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order cheque books, ask tourists for the way to the Macy's store and where new customers open accounts.
Most before me, as I later learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banking employee," were in line for the same reason as I did.
Unlike me, however, they had already picked up their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they were pendling, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called thrifts (a little like a building savings bank), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state and say they treat their customers like a family.
Last year, 15 of these banks have gone silent and silent bankruptcy.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments worth $327 billion, went into bankruptcy management and as last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another bank that owns savings worth $440 billion, was looking for a saving buyer.
In fear of another collapse, the office and shop workers who stood before me brought their cash to a bank considered a safe harbor, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Very normal New Yorkers have acquired flowing financial latein in the last few weeks.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese parent supermarket, with so much familiarity, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bank failed, and their lost-looking board chairman Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my block, has dropped out of our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
“I now have all my savings in money market funds,” she told me after my visit to the bank.
“I’ve changed, I’m no longer taking risks.”
Muslim graves deceived during right-hand slipping in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing judge of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party of Austria, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, participate in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008, to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of road signs on which a mosque is depicted, painted through with a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of burial at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend in which extreme-right parties recorded considerable gains in the country's parliamentary elections.
In the night of Friday on this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely injured in an organized action, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Stern on some of the graves, but criminal officials think this is an attempt to conceal the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the tomb shame, which took place as the religious month of the Muslim Ramadan is nearing the end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is underway in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Allianz for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties who received nearly 30% of the votes, pledged in their campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their votes were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, which won 18% of the votes, advocated a ban on headcloths and burkas and even expressed his aversion to food that is generally linked to Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets on the grounds that these are political symbols of continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which say the extreme right are the politically strongest bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
External travel barrier for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of sexual abuse of children, has been prohibited from traveling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month lock on Glitter after informing the authorities that he was planning to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted last Thursday to impose a foreign travel ban after submitting evidence to judges for Glitter's pre-crime for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
EIn a spokesman for the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, September 25, police in Kent, Ashford District Court, requested permission to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from traveling abroad to France and Spain by March 25.
Paul Gadd wasn’t there personally.”
As required by the register for sexual offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a five-year prison sentence.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or glitters of possible residence in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent’s police unit said, “Police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.”
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
“It is the primary concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we are working closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that could exist to the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he was not comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request him to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK in 1999 for 4 months for possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was calmed and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
“I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character,” Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who do not concentrate and dedicate themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into those moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find the depth of a stolen eye, or the expressiveness of the hands that are concerned because they cannot enter the stage.
In his project 'Flamenco-people', German photographer Günter Bauer represents an alternating theatrical of some stage performances with singer, dancer and guitarist, and he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the program of the month of flamenco photography, “reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is growing from day to day,” explains the artist and makes it clear that `flamenco-people' can be any person, but if you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that there are no typical pictures of the artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience on the stage.
To capture the personality of these artists, you don’t have to take pictures on stage.
Their personality and character is in their hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the characters of the greatest Flamenco masters.
Farmer, inspired by the Festival Cante de las Minas, set out on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remind us of classic photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical foundation of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands Flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotomata.
Famous figures in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who have been photographed.
The project has become an anthology of the flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take this idea up again two years ago and to realize it as a "portrait of sports veterans" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts of the ‘Flamenco-people’ project are different, the photographer also likes to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or encounter people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple of minutes to be able to take a picture.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of the portraits of the Flamenco of today entitled `Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to la calle Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is “an insane bravery.”
He does not yet know where the story of the novel takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in Congo and moved to the Amazon for twenty years.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize winner admitted that the project he is dealing with is “an insanity” and “everything indicates that he would not have to write the novel.”
“If I were wise, I wouldn’t have done it, but I will do it and hopefully finish the novel at some point,” he concluded his participation in the festival, where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of 'La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the premium of the Hay Festival and to which most attendees give their voice, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the Juan Bravo Theater.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noticed that he had an audience before him who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to make the work of the Peruvian, whose inspiration, which emerged from `extraordinary adventure desire', and who wanted to experience the work of the Peruvian,
The Hispano-American novel writer admitted that there is “no way” to measure and how to know if books are changing life, “but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,” Vargas Llosa, who claims that it “effects out” and “deserves the people.”
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play out: bullfighting festivals partially fell out.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the pitch was in bad condition, the bullfighting festival, which was to complete the party in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
The organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the feast was exposed to unstable weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfighting arena.
There was only one celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Julio, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty but without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience reacted to his second battle with Buh-Calls.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand pounds of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, after which they fled.
It looked like they would not have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
Police pursued her and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A.A.J., as the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State announced.
The detainee was charged with drug trafficking and counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the traffic officers of the Álava region had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver failed to follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police began the pursuit until the car stopped at the edge of the strip after a few kilometres, and at the moment the drivers came out of the car to escape through a country road to a forest area.
In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to further police services for accurate laboratory analysis and to weigh the bundles.
Furthermore, the officials noted that the license plate was `double', so it did not match the license plate indicated on the car papers, which is why additional arrest was carried out for counterfeiting of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza are continuing the investigation to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who was able to flee, as mentioned above, but also to find the origin of the seized drugs.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J. was brought to a police station for interrogation and will be brought before the detention judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed her trying to get out of her parking space in Montecito in a rather strange way, a spokesman for California’s traffic police told People magazine.
The Witness detailedly told that Locklear `pushed through the gaspedal after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the parking space, and as she drove backwards she caught her sunglasses a few times.'
A little later, the witness, who had initially probably not noticed the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby street and got out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified emergency service because she had "living for Locklears."
When the police station arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street and thus blocked traffic.
"She seemed unoriented," so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed herself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. "The first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medication," the spokesman said.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and sent to a local arrest at about 7 p.m.
Two months ago, after a treatment, Locklaer was released from the Arizona clinic, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left becomes responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the senior coordinator of the VL and deputy of the United Left, today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
“In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take over the responsibility for this,” Llamazares pointed out the approach that the party must take toward the one who until now sits as city council in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for "transparency" in the possible investigations of the violations of the rules that Silva might have begun: "The VL always insisted that such cases obtain maximum transparency."
With regard to this topic, he stressed that education "has a strict ethical code for all public offices".
`Blood of Mayo': Heroic Book by Garci
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in 'Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous insurrection of the Spaniards against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to “represent a lot of personalities and social analysis” which he has always admired in the works of the famous novel writer, Carci explained today during the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later shown on the channel Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this filming his 'childhood dream' came true. This was due to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to make a commemorative film for the second century celebration on November 2 in Madrid.
The total contribution of 15 million, made by the Autonomous Community of Madrid for shooting, offers Garci, as he added, the "unique possibility" with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing, the image of the "confused Spain, which selected the false leader for the struggle, because the people had been returned to the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand VII.
However, Cineast regrets that the financing of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya (twice as high as Sangre de mayo) could not be counted, so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci collaborated almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a comenzar', has contributed through his ordinary way of working: he stood on stage to the actors with whom one must first probe before starting to film, and for those who had not done casting, he seemed to work in the theatre, to do what is 'humiliating' and to give respect in the cinema, part of the profession of the film director.
Many actors he encounters in Sangre de mayo must repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar nominee in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three nominees representing Spain in front of the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize it’s only for prosperity, and now you’re satisfied if you’ve produced another movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of work.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who also came from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first women fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian, and stood for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who left her mark in the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe during the period between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.
"We are not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her spirit," said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
“The Dance of the Butterfly” seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or “the Dance of the Snake” like Tango.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,” she claims.
The stage expects two exceptional collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel in one of her performances, as he did in La puerta abierta; and with Flamenco master Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her former students.
Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy that she agreed to participate in my work, and I am very honored.”
The stage also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he's always taking on the role of the companion of the D's.
In this work, it is also narrated in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
“I wanted to recall her, for I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain era and whose works no one can now appreciate and therefore appreciate her even less,” says Bayón.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' at the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides a corresponding atmosphere to carry out the planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008).
Thus, the course of the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón is completed with the new edition of this work, with the international congress, which takes place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia, and with the international hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in New York in May and after the congress.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of 'Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso, with the aim of making the person and work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The United States can imagine it badly without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
This sentence comes from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then prevailing notion of American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic notion and followed her.
Look how much it cost him to award him an Oscar.
When he withdrew in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
“What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford crying, “my life and my country were the biggest troubles of his life.”
No one was afraid to ridicule or exaggerate himself.
As the ‘father’ of cinema and homeland, he died in a sad moment of fear of terrorists and the market collapse, in which the Americans’ depressed self-esteem is in the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If in this difficult time without virtue few people remain to be admired, then you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered, like various losses, both gains: from the foundation that was committed to the fight against drugs and in honour of his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country where it took him a lot of effort to fight against a deadly dietary culture.
A wide wave of amazement suggests high over Hollywood regardless of nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the peak of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“The biggest of us has left us all,” confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dare to try to live as Paul Newman lived today: maintaining high demands on righteousness, leading a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there’s someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was loyal, although there certainly were many possibilities to be.
‘Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?’ he often joked himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily usual in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was in none as proud as those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are deficient.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, ‘Are we prepared for this?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
It was called a perfect street, and in my opinion, it was the worst street with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you were to consider the review and I could check it, this would clearly not have been done.
But let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pick-up that allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, then they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the road).
So don't.
Here they only get you the ticket (the first nonsense that is just to go there for that reason) and (after an endless queue) there is the surprise! The t-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric?
All right, things like these are a little bit compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave the backpack laid.
Waiting took more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a street where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we hadn’t left our backpacks in front of it, even if it was once managed, but it would be more difficult to get it back.
In addition, it looked like rain in these 40 minutes of waiting, so that there was the temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the house.
I think tomorrow some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in the classification in time because of this chip I got, I can already think the output was incorrectly stamped.
Of course, if I were asked for a perfect street, that street would never come to my mind.
So I think we will dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games for a long time.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft introduced the progress of the new image recognition system and human-interaction, an essence of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, it is a route planner to move onto the company's campus).
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this 'receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also classify the attendees into the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video, the receptionist notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that leads with her conversation, and that no company employee is either.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and replies that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week we talked very superficially about Microsoft’s change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a finding, considering that Microsoft in Windows versions added one or another function and `extras'.
Change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chromium appeared on the net, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
Many have pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an essential part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of its ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
Every time people pay less attention to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run Firefox, Explorer, or Chrome, and every day we spend more time browsing than in the surroundings of the window.
What is half of existing applications in the computer?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easier, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without a doubt. I give a small example of it.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshing machine is a sign attached: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google to search online.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to the clothing of a well-built priest.
When we begin to count the countless star appearances, we can go back to the picture of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard, who had raised heavy weights in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male cotton t-shirt, sleeveless and tailored.
The English speakers call it `tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
Firstly, because of its great name, although it is named 'Marcel' in the narrow circle, the legend tells that the naming is linked to sport and was born from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' surpasses all because of its outstanding cotton, its distinctive unisex cut, and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (nearly recognizable) that these t-shirts have as a detail on the neck.
And beware, the Belgian company is not just focused on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kashmire, Cotton Trousers, T-Shirts with Stripes, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is a shame to use them as underwear.
They are very attractive.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is tiny, but full of joy in life.
Currently, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, relocating her residence and also making the presentation of the most important awards in fashion that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on short distances.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and also attended the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and took part in the dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intensive working time that is exciting at the same time.
You are working for the Spanish house, what is the foundation of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both of me, are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to go through a city and watch women dressed, combining their clothes, I often do that.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I think so, but finally, everything comes together in one, and these areas have many things in common.
Since I was a kid, I was delighted with the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to swirl around in my aunt’s clothing closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to a theme park.
Later on, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to clothing.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and at the rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you become the real actor.
After all, everything is linked together, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
Have you recently turned 30, have you not fallen into a crisis?
Oh, what?
I feel better than ever when I was thirty years old.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I am not afraid of my biological clock.
I have done the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time, I have already known that I am becoming a mother because that is what my body demands and also I want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you will keep in mind the works you took part in and were filmed last year.
That’s exactly how it is and I really want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman coming from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I highly hope that 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A couple of days ago you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It’s not like I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the charity event of her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothing we are showing. I know that two clothes from our Mango collection were auctioned to raise money for Naomi's NGO.
People don’t know Naomi’s good heart.
There's a lot of things being told about her, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a hand stand, I will do so too.
To support women in the Third World, what is needed.
Drivers who may fall back due to alcohol levels will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The authority orders the driver who had three official penalties for alcohol levels to install in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunk state.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General’s Office, which they say is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to re-socialize the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behaviour.
In addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automotive Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were shown more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol sat back on the wheel.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents auto start when the driver has taken an alcohol test; or when an alcohol concentration that is higher than allowed is detected.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of breaches of the rules in the first year after their introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented in the usual way, and yet a reform of the Fundamental Law is demanded, which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
The device is still not available in any store in the Spanish markets, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF landed the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force, with the prince and princess of Asturias travelling.
The sun went down, but their rays still forced the hand to use as an umbrella to see the royal couple coming out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A couple of hours before that, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the prince and princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Oh, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time. You're from here or something.
No, she's the Spanish woman, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, so, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the journey.
Many are waiting in the airport’s hangar and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 Navy soldiers who are delivering Honorary Salvation.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in marine blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-drawn hairs, without ordinary 'peep-toes', perhaps was told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official follow-up is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican television reporter who likes to joke is waiting for her.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially outstanding fashion designers and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and increase internationally young fashion talent.
This is awarded with a cash price of 300,000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango Filiale on Boulevard Haussmann No. 54 in Paris and almost cryed because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest store of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1,335 m2.
The biggest store is located in London.
So many events have happened that one would like to thank fashion designer Valentino for his presidency at the competition. All ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by the pain of his brother died recently, tears down. He dressed the suit from the fashion house and worn some jewelry of ELAH that were stunning. He held on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at dinner, to his honour.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, greeted the guests and was such a knight, so he ended up with the Baron of Red Shield without jackets, because they borrowed jackets to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has rushed to the shop and had a pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. On a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was in excitement, reminded of a kind of Stan's ancient times.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we could look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always provokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own bedding and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Advice against stress
There is not 1000, but one more way to forget our chaotic daily lives.
And even if they are few, they are all collected in a book that describes how to get to relaxation. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment if it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse appears the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that the current life demands.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to tackle the daily exhaustion and the problems of shutting off the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents the entire list of options adapted to each individual’s taste and time.
The work against stress is called '1001 ways to relax' and so the tranquility that the book conveys comes to the book shops by the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who believes that it is impossible to achieve peace of mind in areas such as workplaces with the help of personal contacts, this manual refutes such belief.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the balance of the body and stress has become a problem, then it’s time to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Speaking in Sleep
Some children talk at night
I do not mean those who wake up and tell us what happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Of course, more than one of you was told that you were talking at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (one time in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Relationships are often sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic anxiety at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), talking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you can speak quietly in single words, whisper, or it can be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and consult with a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and thus occurs.
We said it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful TV programs that are awful and a bit too wild.
In nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
When talking happens in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be unable to remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if you are afraid after a pair of appearances, it is recommended to get advice or find out what reason the child is afraid of.
When they understand what it says (which is not so ordinary), the child does not put pressure to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child is asleep, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Perhaps, it doesn’t tell the child that you hear it at night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that takes only a few minutes.
Houses... finally.
After a long stretch of thirst, illy houses on the field are finally on track again.
Without much effort, the yellow blacks gained numerous goals and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot passed near the corner, illy houses were to dominate the game with ease, and it succeeded in alternating first Fonderflick with a remote shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge Denmark's defense.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and only let the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with two goal chances initially fought by Riahi and temporary, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, which stood exactly right to take a ball back that had been denied in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the ill-goaling scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, whereby his teammates had to continue to play in number lower.
Denmark, however, was unable to take advantage of this and did not face any major problems with an Ilhaeus eleven, who only slightly declined to "compress" their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a large mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another trip to Brittany.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to meet Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him ‘with a constructive spirit’, and hoped that he would come with ‘concrete suggestions’.
The President’s visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee, established by the Breton fishermen to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in diesel price, which has reached a record value of an average of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the press spokesman of the Elysée Palace, David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their businesses become competitive again, and to secure the conditions of work and pay for seafarers.”
Sarkozy is determined to be expected by the fishermen.
Tuesday morning they led protest marches at Morbihan and Calvados, causing traffic jams nearly ten kilometers long.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break.
The peninsula of Quiberon was delimited by a lock.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient from the early morning, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement expanded to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishermen did not fly out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the commercial ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the major Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the ministry on Wednesday before they decide on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the responses to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue," because "the fishermen will not give up at any point" and "do not want to go to Paris," announced Liliane Cariou, president of the fisheries committee of Lorient, for example.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost about 50 cents per liter, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes said goodbye to the film legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 aircraft supplied this year, despite the threat of recession, to be a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, meets its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft supplied, its President Fredrico Fleury Curado said.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer supplied 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the scale of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving up more than 15% of its assets.
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which has been financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering disbursing more than 15% of its assets to repay the $85 billion it was given before it.
AIG is prepared to drive the sale of most of its businesses beyond its international life insurance and retirement pensions in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met Sunday evening to check possible sales.
No confirmation was obtained at the AIG.
Among the assets AIG may be separated from include its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, FT further explains.
With regard to these sales, no final decision was made, FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible to repay the loans of more than 85 billion dollars granted by the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the U.S. authorities will receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the Session Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to rescue the banks, reported a historic fall in the prices: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As for the points, the worst case in its history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final start-up figures, the index Nasdag, mainly related to technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used index Standard&Poors 500 fell by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
Following the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to rescue the banks, which was to restore some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which was already hit by the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, MEPs refused the funds he requested to Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“Here is a bad picture that presents Congress as incapable of adopting a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will “come too late.”
“If the project is actually doomed to fail (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the US Central Bank) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further restrict credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economic officer at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, emphasizing even more the feeling of extreme urgency that “every day that eliminates brings the ruin of a financial company” in the United States.
Following Washington Mutual’s bankruptcy on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned to buy Wachovia’s banking operations by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” the analyst at FTN Financial added.
The market for basic supplies has grown strongly.
Revenues from the State Cash within 10 years have declined from 3.632% Friday night to 3.827%, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first television duel
The first debate of the two White House candidates on Friday followed another debate to find out who came out as a winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the headquarters for the election of both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this television duel, which was to be pursued by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite remarkable, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop his decline in election polls five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, from which an opinion poll was published on Saturday, according to which Obama is at the forefront with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat clearly makes the better figure.
Among the still indecisive voters, that is, those that matter now, Obama came out with 39% as a winner from the polls, while according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain continued to highlight his unmistakable experience in foreign policy, clearly emphasizing his opponent’s “nativity” in these issues, which were at the heart of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...,” he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
A point of attack that has been preached since yesterday in the Republican elections.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and accurately, without getting out of the way.
He put his ability at the forefront to make good decisions and to renew the image that the world has of the United States.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, Obama, on the other hand, has already put a democratic electoral advertising spot this weekend against accusing Republicans of not capturing the full extent of the crisis that is burdening the “American off the street.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in rain on the occasion of an election in North Carolina.
He didn’t even mention the words ‘middle’ or ‘workers’.’ The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans think is best suited to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss, a clear advantage.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final judgment of an eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Having once again emphasized that he would probably even manage to cut taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a potential energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, would have a top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully overlooked the issues that arose on the plan to save the financial market over $700 billion (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress yesterday night and is extremely unpopular among the people.
“Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?”
Youth and opposition demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening since the closure of the electoral venues in Minsk to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: "The dictator should resign."
Some admit they didn’t vote at all: ‘What is the benefit of doing what they want with my voice?’ says a teenager.
They do not believe that the regime that has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union is prepared to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-issuing of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the icing of certain assets, could be lifted if those elections were deemed clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, it wasn’t.
“We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting,” said Juri Potemkin, a press spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
When opposition deputies move into parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcast time on television, meetings in the regions and legislation proposals.'
The opposition is thus obliged to interfere in the political game, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be opened.'
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, gets into a crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, will not recognise the election as valid.
She stresses that voting seems too high, and that the increase in voting in advance (26% of Minsk’s voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners to be released in August this year.
There was no one in the election rooms.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies in parliament, the ones that are most likely to correspond to the views of the government.'
The silence of the night goes down again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Interview - From Blood That Became Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its founding, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all the reasons to be pleased because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained the public trust that had been severely shaken by the scandal of the infested blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood donation service were infected with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Faced with this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada initiated a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and developing guidelines to prevent a renewed catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to issue his report, several provinces set up a committee at the time to develop a new system for managing blood stored in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
According to reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec started working, barely 38% of people had confidence in Quebec’s blood-conserved system, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the tremendous efforts to improve the safety of blood conserves and by working in this area for the next few years, we have regained public confidence,” she says, before proudly emphasizing that in early 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec’s population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps aware that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its foundation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec acts on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman, who has been in charge since its foundation in 1998.
“And we had no idea whether this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which exclusion measures are applied if you do not know this and if a disease is only progressing slowly, as is obviously the case with the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by brain degeneration, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago it was proven without any doubt that this disease is transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event showed us that the principle of caution that we applied is quite meaningful.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NSTs), which allow to detect the occurrence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibody against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST allowed to shorten the incubation time between the time when the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it, and you could not recognize it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of AIDS transmission through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of getting HIV-infected blood.
In other words, it means that you would have to distribute 12 million blood stocks before anyone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 conserved blood each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case of HIV was transmitted via a conserved blood.
I believe that you can feel comfortable with getting a blood transfusion or prescribing it to restore health," says Hema-Quebec's Chief Executive Officer.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
Only last year has the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects through the blood.
“We need to monitor continuously,” continues Dr. Décary before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec needs to provide adequate supply in addition to a secure supply.
“The demand is rising because the population is aging.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also affects the blood donor network, which on average only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants are eligible for blood donation.'
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the suitability criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who supply their blood will not be accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread will be excluded from blood donation for a year.
`With these 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep it and make it become regular donors.
“Life is so hectic nowadays that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” said Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec supplies not only conserved blood but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which are used almost exclusively for serious fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public umbilical cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells that can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to take out more than a thousand per year.
“We should probably start making it available for transplantation early next year,” explains Dr. Décary, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood reduction as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it,” because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal’s Impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Sounders from Seattle in the second and decided the quarterfinal game in the Saputo Stadium, where the total goal ratio counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the USL’s first league exit games.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute.
After a first halftime without goals for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other goals for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who stood up for the Sounders.
Remember that at the first pre-and-return game of the series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle, had a 2 to 1 loss.
In the semi-finals, Impact will be matched with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thunder was able to offset a 3-to-1 deficit by a 4-to-3 victory, but the whitecaps moved into the semi-final round with a total goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Victory by Kovalev
The number 1 trio of the Canadian team is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn advanced the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, resulting in a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the tricolores into six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the entire shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable.”
“He was too fixed on it in the first half,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause.'
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year.
Once the general assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest moved yesterday to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today’s partial election.
“Moving the course of our last major border to the north”: this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines completely.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
Three huge screens turned spectacular pictures of hydropower plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large funds as during the parliamentary period.
By the way, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would hold the elections this autumn, even though he had stated that his schedule was very full.
The “Plan North” is the fourth element of a “vision” the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a “new economic area” which provides for an agreement with France on labor, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speeches recently, the opening of the north – the northern area at the 49th latitude – has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is “a gem with enormous potential,” but did not mention any date, sums of investment or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some perspectives on what could be worked on more: above all on water energy, forests, but especially the mining sector, favored by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charests, the north has nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.
This 'area twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It is not only near us, it is within us," he stressed, as to show clearly that he is seeking to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown greatly through its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, Quebec’s technology, the James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always requested, the Prime Minister told the press.
“This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
"There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, when the opportunity comes, I will retake this position on behalf of the government," he said.
Furthermore, “with climate change we need to rethink our vision of the north,” he explained, talking about the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible throughout the year due to ice melting.
Given this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this territory.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said the Quebec government would handle them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist deputies of Ungava) have already initiated discussions with about thirty communities.
A committee of Ministers led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Mineral Resources) occupies an important place, has started the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, "not necessarily a summit", but an opportunity where "one will create a common vision".
The development of the north will be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be “debated, regulated and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as a continuation of the Liberal Prime Ministers who served before him.
“Like the Liberals who served before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.
This was, by the way, one of the repeatedly raised themes of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s acquisition of the party leadership.
One of the adopted decisions envisages renaming the Beauharnois power plant into the Adelard-Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, through reading, who achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” said Jean Charest.
He referred to another, this time conservative project, the Roads to the North program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the project Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest emphasizes that it is scheduled to be commissioned in 2012.
“That remains among us, but I am planning to be there,” he entrusted his party members, which led to those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact not yet excluded the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him by law.
However, he emphasizes that his schedule is full, mainly because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general assembly of the weekend provided the leader of the Liberal Party with a platform of nationalist plans, especially from 'constitutional objectives', which were promptly adopted: the PLQ calls for the recognition of the 'speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on decisions made in Quebec.
The opposition adopted the North Plan guidelines with skepticism.
The head of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, has re-emphasized the policy for the development of Northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, did not apply it.
If she had done it, “we would have been much further today,” Ms. Marois judged alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has voted in favour of supporting the government’s adoption of a Northern Plan.
“But what we want is that this will not just be a great idea,” said party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation of Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letters - A Degraded Country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (which irony) in the Cabinet of Harper, was the one who allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a "disgrace" for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unending struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover up with shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one of all the affected countries that has not brought home its fellow man captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things that were accused of happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate under inhumane conditions.
The only one who descends to a judicial parody to assess the guilt of the accused.
Remember that above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Lawyers’ Association are calling for Omar Khadr to be brought home to get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes the eyes of torture: it doesn’t care that a young adult will surely be forever mentally broken after so many years of torment.
We are not yet aware of this, but here we are experiencing a deceitful circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', that word that Harper carries forth constantly like a flag, and that sounds so nonsense out of his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one may arbitrarily mistreat, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, entirely in the pleasure of a leader who is to date supported only by a minority (may he belong entirely to a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has rejected what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this rejection, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwell Speech of Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director-General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and in doing so pursues an Orwellian logic that the world’s largest gold-winning company sought a defamation lawsuit of over six million against three authors and a small, impoverished publishing house, with the aim of opening a “public transparent debate.”
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they judge not the truth, especially not in the case of defamation suits, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the process ends, the authors and publisher of the Noir Canada book will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the gold mine’s almost inexhaustible pockets.
The tactics in these unequal struggles are often to ruin the defenders in order to force a consensual arrangement that silences the opposite and also dissuads anyone who dares to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she should have presented her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast to what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are typically conducted through exchange of ideas and not through bumps.
It would have been enough if the gold mine had revealed its books and files and opened a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams that could have brought light on this question.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes away the petitions and letters to support Noir Canada’s authors with a hand movement.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can ask for a "public" debate at the same time while disregarding the opinions of this public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice-President, this word includes only the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even defamators have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public supported by the authors and editors of Noir Canada does this primarily because they reject the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a kneeling complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which it requires them to stop using this term...).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s complaint is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and truth-finding that is fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that do not like the wealthy companies of this world, then who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she pretends, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it is time for governments to take action to restrict this kind of unjustified suit.
Rescue for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and the senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaking Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two congressional chambers.
The main contents are: Improved MEP control over the practical implementation of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new provisions to curb the number of houses confiscated due to defaults, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the senior employees of the supported companies.
U.S. Secretary of Finance Henry Paulson, Chamber President Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative present in the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,” said Bush Administration representative Henry Paulson.
“It was all to protect the real economy and the American people from the Wall Street currency crisis,” she said.
“This is the basic point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, for fear of the effect that a renewed failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were only involved late in the negotiations, showed themselves rather as proponents of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on adding certain arrangements, especially those that allow owners to retain their homes, and those that concern the salaries of senior employees of state-rescued companies.
“When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is nothing you could congratulate yourself on.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television channels.
When he was asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied, “I would like to know the details first, but I hope it.
“The guidelines I have read show that this is one thing that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing at all is simply not acceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is aimed at paying taxpayers’ money.
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the burst of a real estate bubble, which initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime) before it expanded to further forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally resulted in a freezing of financial power and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican deputies failed last week’s first attempt to reach an agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not purchased, it is believed to escape the blind alley.
To round out the viewpoints for everyone in Congress, a warrant has also been added that if the government makes losses with this program within five years, it can then collect new taxes in order to recover its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion dollars, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion dollars must be approved by Congress in a re-vote.
In return for his aid, Washington receives shares in the supported companies, which bring dividends to it in the case of profits, and which it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to halt the seizure procedures in respect of the housing bound to the real estate loans affected by this plan, as well as to set deadlines for the repayment and compensation to be paid to the executive officers of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the House of Representatives to vote on it today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet sure that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday there were other votes against this plan, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
“Obviously Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the House’s financial commission, said to his voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is to ask taxpayers to check out."
Democratic MP Brad Sherman, head of a congressional group called "the Caucus of the Skeptics," presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us: We ask Congress not to be put under pressure and carefully consider which path to go,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, we have once again received evidence in Europe that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who is in great difficulty since she lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis due to the high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
“This is not lost money,” said the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
In order to compensate, we receive a voting right and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households appreciate now that uncertain times are announcing.'
During this time, on the other side of the Channel, the British government was about to nationalize another bank in distress from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans from Bank Bradford and Bringley, including over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the UK bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock to nationalize the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a dedicated icon
His beauty with the azure blue eyes was for a long time his trump, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor with his charming smile free himself from the narcissistic mirror?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monsters to life.
But what a great continuous runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom for a long time he was a kind of rival on the canvas, more careful in his performance, surely also more fragile, but just as an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often gives wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots should arise one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
For in it, a whole country that was in love with the self-made man was reflected in the fighter who was wounded in the Pacific War in battle, who studied acting art in Yale in the early 1950s and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York before having success in the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became second in the Man's 24-hour race in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it also disappear the unknown facets of this mysterious, restrictive, engaged and hypersensitive star, the glamour of show business, whose mystery you will never completely solve.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death put the movie lovers into a taumel this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of memories.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing with him.
Then again the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Sheet Roof, filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is awakened to his sensitive Lord Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all of their promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, who was reopened after his death and properly announced the Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic Ganove in the outstanding The Sting, who was awarded the Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the times, that was he.
Still he.
In his CV, epochs come together.
The youth knows him mostly from George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the unorthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him back in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several movie legends that withdrew from the film world early enough, Newman was supposed to stay in the saddle for a long time, traiting Hollywood, his wealth, his beauty, and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to ‘underplaying’ when he judged his all too expressive achievements.
The job was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, peasants or desperates, with whose perfect depiction he slid off and reflected his revolt.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown sides of his true sensitivity.
His 1968 Rachel, Rachel (after the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle female portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott due to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of finesse and sadness.
In the flood of honors yesterday over Newman, his close friend and former weapons companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared that "His presence has improved my life and this country."
Generosity and joy of life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Besides his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s drift, is now going away.
We’ve probably often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
Nevertheless, the profits from his sales flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: “Your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And for us it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the closest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On October 8, the negotiations in criminal proceedings begin against János and his accomplices.
The accused is accused in particular of involvement in organized crime, as well as gross negligence and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the funds drawn from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often covered with fake invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are reported to have been transferred to the cash registers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, and to the cash registers of individuals.
As the investigative authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when the tender funds were received, and the clubs are not expected to have fulfilled their obligations either.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were counterfeited.
The invoice blocks were bought from the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices should be issued to was decided on that round trip north of Lake Plate, to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour", Lados should find guesthouses and restaurants.
He requested invoices on consumption in order to be able to later issue invoices based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest.
These bills are supposed to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András <0xC5><0x90>ri, the latter, according to our information, was responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer restaurant.
As can be seen in two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003, the restaurant company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the head of the company states that such a large group would not have fit into the local at once.
Another invoice, issued in summer 2002 to the foundation Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also indicated serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed according to the bill.
The imagination of the counterfeiters had no limits as well when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering company, in whose accounting documents the customers Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hoppá did not appear, according to the prosecutor’s authority.
As Managing Director Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu, he immediately realized that it was fake documents when documents were submitted to him by the prosecutor’s office during an interrogation.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly placed on the stamp."
Furthermore, apart from form errors, it was also wrong that the company was supposed to have housed a hundred people after having a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to accommodate so many people.
Also mentioned on the bill was meals, the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The emerging invoice counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted exclusively offers travel abroad, and thus they indicated Hungarian travel on the cash invoice, which also contradicted the company’s accounting practice.
As the investigations have known, they also mentioned VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Stiftung Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>rt, since the company charges only 15% VAT instead of 25, and the employees only issue machine invoices, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake made by the "invoices" was that in a case they had indicated "good transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor's office announced.
Further form errors - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont were uncounterfeited.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors asserted that they never issued the invoices.
Another "error" is the counterfeiters suffered at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this society was in dissolution at the time (2001), when the group of Fiat Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that he did not issue the bills himself.
Consciously falsified
The other group of invoicers are persons who were well aware that they would have to make fictional invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, in an amount of approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional bills.
The Biogate Kft. currently in liquidation is also reported to have worked together with Supplement and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is supposed to be the Stiftung Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Alapítvány, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyesület with fake invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million.
However, there was also little payment process, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, but the persons concerned have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of invoicers includes persons directly associated with the defendant.
One of them is Ivan Kubatov, the post officer of the Ukrainian managing director of the Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest but not found there.
This company is reported to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components totalling approximately HUF 18 million during the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigative authority, the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
Managing Director of this company was a Romanian to whom the company documents were also to be provided by Ivan Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information during the investigation, Kubatov admitted to having issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalent value itself.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. are supposed to have been founded by Romanian masons on the express wish of Ivan Kubatov.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, according to the accused, due to lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was in charge of preparing the company foundation documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as at Atlasz and Y-Generació.
Kubatov is reported to have issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice and the VAT each.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictional invoices - in this case the invoices were attached to Biztos Pont applications.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szovétség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 Forints each, but these amounts were used for non-profit purposes.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictional invoices from the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of Árpád Kemecsei’s office at the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some accused are now expected to confess to the method of counterfeiting, as they were already filed before the prosecutor’s office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant János decides to add to a comprehensive confession.
His previous data were less detailed, and although he had pledged several times to report extensively on everything, his confession remains.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the compensation of the majority of the damage incurred of HUF 50 million, and whether the contract is ready in return to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that Supplement is now playing the "insulted" after his requests for mitigation of the imprisonment and house arrest were met with deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused much greater damage with economic crimes and have not paid them, are on free foot, or at least under house arrest, supplementation remains denied this possibility.
The Psychology of Over-Offering - Or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and thus overvalue the bidding.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the Science magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an eBay auction, and are therefore willing to pay even overpriced prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lottery while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the volunteers were investigated using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the players were able to win money, however, an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain bark, was measured among the losers of the auction, in which the overtaking of the opponent plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believed that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To support their thesis, the economists in the research group also conducted research to track the money.
In this case, three groups should be offered against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their operations.
Another group was also promised $15 reward in case they emerged as winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that the emphasis on one was on winning, while on the other was on losing.
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the group playing against losing were prepared for higher stakes than those in the control and win-win groups.
“These findings can be derived from no previous economic theory.
In fact, these have justified the behaviours observed at auctions so far only with the joy of profiting or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York's Economic Faculty.
Hepatitis: When to visit the doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected is estimated at a hundred thousand in the country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowness are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from one another.
Depending on the pathogen, hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vagina or saliva).
Travellers are advised to vaccinate against viruses A and B at any rate, there is no vaccine against virus C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by unwellness, weakness, abdominal pain and breach.
After that, yellowness occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine darkens, and recovery can last up to two to three weeks.
Around 1 million people worldwide die annually from the far more serious diseases caused by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected people are on drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insanely destroys the liver cells - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who underwent blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the family doctor for the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognised in a timely manner, the disease can be cured, the virus can be eradicated, thus preventing the risk of infection and preventing the onset of cancer.
Sept. 30 is World Hepatitis Day, hosted by patient representations worldwide for the first time in 2004.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
Recent research shows that religious belief acts as a kind of “pain remedy” that has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it was investigated to what extent belief in God affects human pain, the British journal Telegraph reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electro-shock while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers were able to eliminate most of the pain.
A brain scan technology even proved that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project involving philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
During the attempt, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would elicit some sort of religious transe, while selecting da Vinci’s image, because it barely differed from the other paintings and was felt as reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, receiving a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during that time, while looking at either the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that when they saw the Mother of God, they felt “secure” as if they were “careful” and they felt “rest and peace.”
While looking at the religious painting, they reported 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in sight.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be caused with other, strongly-acting images among the atheists, if you only had to find the corresponding photo.
“We should find an image that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change our personality, and it does in many cases,” Wright said.
After these outstanding results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another similar painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you tell about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth anniversary, Google can rightly claim that she can be found in people’s pockets just as well as over their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their vacation, which specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that’s still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managing directors of Google.
Towards skeptics who are plagued by Orwell’s horror visions, he says: these would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said Google’s primary goal was to collect even more personal data about users, thus getting closer to the company’s original goal, which it wants to “order all the information in this world.”
Schmidt said Google was only at the beginning of the collection of information after 10 years of world-changing work.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs were not yet able to do it because they didn't know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms were registered during their Internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later resort to it so that the hits can be generated much more accurately later, and on the same logic are also based the so-called "recommendations" with which the system recommends customized products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of data abuse - "If you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more likely that the potential power represented by the company is fearful, less the feeling of guilt or the fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or the rejection of the power that many Internet users reject.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, through which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected by the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of pedophilia.
However, in May, when Google and the civil rights organization EFF successfully brought the FBI to court for personal rights, Google could not be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request in the future with no point of the Constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the juvenile protection law passed years ago, however it was denied the list of individual users, respectively their web and search terms list for two months retroactively.)
Google’s image remains therefore controversial: those who dislike to disclose their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimate sphere through the use of Google services, whip the company with the duly outrage of the companies performing conservatively.
However, the American "geek culture", which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is a market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes from its users, and provides its services for free, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package appears to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the software giant’s official practices.
On the other hand, the geeks are seeing the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet sharply - a relationship that has been put in the focus especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing but collaboration, i.e., users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average teenager can manage his/her profile at the same time on multiple community portals - from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them through other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of these into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that are the latest photo galleries that are automatically displayed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: when looking at last night’s party photos, the girlfriend soon finds out who her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is dismissed because he is just too honest about his anxiety about corporate management in his blog – one thing is sure: the term “privacy” has become newly interpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he discloses about himself - so you could somehow formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can enjoy doing so – like using Scroogle, a tool that, while accessing Google’s search engine, doesn’t deliberately leave any traces.
Many people do not deliberately register on community sites so that they are not found, but Google’s online applications, such as text processing and graphics tools and RSS feeds, can also deal with alternative versions that are not linked to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible user profile.
Public opinion, however, is waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising space threatens advertising agencies’ revenue, and the ever-faster-introduced services provide not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headbreaking.
However, critical viewers also find the worrying counterpole: for example, the Group management completely rejected a protest of the employees, after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, moreover, the management thought that the good taste of the employees would be too expensive, this all seems to be even mildly against the fact that in 2006 Google was in front of the Chinese government.
The internal regulations of the group are that no new service will be advertised in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years might again be a lot of reversal: While some think that Google's book and magazine profile makes it possible to scan or archive project, others now assume that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already provides the next generation of sci-fi authors with the substance - such as "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorow describes in best Orwellian way a future in which a person becomes terrifyingly close thanks to Google-related data.
Two teenagers help the double killer of Ózd to eliminate traces
In connection with the double killing of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping to remove the traces, a spokesman for the police commission Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were competent, and they are currently charged with aid.
According to the news agency MTI, these are two girls who are defending themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is suspected of deliberately murdering several people for money greed.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to repay his debt, so he attracted his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man planned the crime by a long hand - this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
Together with experts, police now investigate the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Offers Purchase for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the stock packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer the Poles had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is entirely owned by the state.
99% of the stocks are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, intends to sell more than 60% of the stocks in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of the Poles includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague stock exchange.
The newspaper reports that the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Stock Exchange have so far offered bids.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not exclude that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders agreement, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The biggest owner of the Prague stock exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments on the ever-growing international financial crisis, some leading European papers spoke on Tuesday of the "September 2nd".
We owe the global financial disaster to the American president, saying "La Repubblica" - the president had not even been able to turn his own party for the bill behind him to one that would bring some relief into the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billion-dollar investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “September 11th.”
Parts of the press in Madrid are also locating the Goat of Atonement in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a threat that Washington will not have a political means of crisis management ready.
The world economy hangs in the air just at a time when one of the biggest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be overlooked, for example, the Geneva "Dayes-Indicator" means.
While some states could still provide rescue packages to their banks and save the banks from bankruptcy with the money of the taxpayers.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are bankrupt, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control over the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid out to weakening financial institutions, the Viennese "Standard" recalls. Furthermore, the newspaper continues, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers would now have to grab their pockets a little deeper in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not dealt seriously with the crisis, which is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
Though the "savers" would not have to "sweat" immediately with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to note, in which case it would be reasonable to touch the money of the taxpayers in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of the hummingbird
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to prevent accidents, if not to imitate obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
CEATEC in Japan introduced an amazing project that inspired Nissan engineers to create new systems to prevent accidents.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C-type biomimetic system, a mini car equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield," Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, told the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
In order to mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers adopted the idea of the laser-controlled distance gauge.
This identifies obstacles in front of the BR23C in a 180-degree field of vision within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision avoidance process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the author robot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it didn’t, the author robot couldn’t react fast enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the author robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield – a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable at the moment.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, the evasion, unlike the bees, can not take place up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and that is only in the direction of the tire's turnability.
While there are endless possibilities for the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers could only use the rotation or acceleration and deceleration of the author robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy-efficient and therefore have a longer life than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained, it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, less on the processing of data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It doesn’t have to store them or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous manoeuvres, so it requires only a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by consciously steering the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the $700 billion rescue package law is available, which will apply in several stages and aims to buy the banks’ poor loans.
In the first run, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended Saturday after midnight local east coast time, Congress members, after several days of debates, broke through an agreement on the $700 billion rescue package, Reuters said.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives, saying the agreement should be put on paper.
Both presidential candidates – Barack Obama and John McCain – supported the compromise reached on the rescue package.
In conclusion, Finance Minister Henry Paulson said that the programme will be effective and efficient, but more must be done. According to Pelosi, it was not about rescuing Wall Street, but about pushing the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high-rise flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives first voted on the bill of 2008 to stabilize the economy, then the Senate turned.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress made overnight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
However, the program deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent at once for the purchase of lazy, loan-burdened securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion will be spent, with 250 billion available immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This amount is to be spent on the purchase of loan-loaded, poor securities, and the president is to decide on the additional $100 billion.
The program is reviewed by a commission of its own, which is also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another Congressional decision.
For the purposes of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase poor loans, mortgages, and securities charged with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by the department’s competent persons, the purchase can be done both at an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies pay fees corresponding to the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds so that up to $700 billion can be made available as an emergency aid to the U.S. financial system, whether it be for the large-scale purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it has been signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks in trouble and now relying on state aid can expect their handlings, which in overseas language are called "Golden Handshake", to be cut down by the government.
There will only be a reduction in salaries in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps in each case.
The cut essentially means that if the ministry purchases through an auction, the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the outdated chief banker is deported into the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the rotten loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that managers’ salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts are not changed - the restrictions only refer to new agreements so that more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts on manager salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the financial committee, commented on the measure.
The state acquires participation rights in the participating banks, so the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the rescued bank gets better.
The bill stipulates that the president must submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should recover their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan is not protecting the taxpayers’ money at all, according to the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said the actions were driven by the same people who were also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

No more U.S. visa since 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the American-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force by January 12, as the Foreign Minister declared before representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, "everything now depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system overseas will be introduced in time."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be negotiating in Washington today.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand her over to the Republic of Hungary’s “Middle Cross of Merit with Star,” and she also holds talks with Democrat Barack Obama’s foreign policy advisors and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major U.S. parties, pledged their support for the $700 billion rescue package for banks on Sunday, but there are politicians asking for the resignation of the finance minister.
The Congress and government officials announced after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they have reached an agreement on the banking rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better suited than their respective opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his edge thanks to economic issues, while McCains Hoch, which gave him the presentation of Vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was at the same time melting away.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly adopt the $700 billion package law.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
“We have to act now, and that is, responsibly (...) – your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened,” he said before 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain’s economic vision “obsolete.”
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said: "We will all have difficulty in doing this ... but not doing is certainly not an alternative."
The Republican senator said the plan also requires the establishment of a control committee for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of dealings for top managers – something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House spokeswoman Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill already on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (mirror.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution annihilates their fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his offices.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades – now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The epoch break is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is the case for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come, but on Sunday something ended, which, however, already happened quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Because ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU fell at 47.7 percent, falling below the fifty percent mark for the first time since the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. in the much-cited Stoiber era.
The CSU’s consistent modernization in the state has ultimately destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but it was considerably estimated in pace, but without impact, the secularization, the educational successes, the accession of Eastern and Northern Germans to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain loyal to the CSU voters.
Modernization is always accompanied by increased options, and this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-indulgent.
It is noticeable that in the last few weeks the classical groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the free professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school degree.
The support of the CSU dropped to below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna Tageszeitung reports in its article "Who with whom? party leaders with restraint in coalition issues" on the chaotic internal political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPO from interfering in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to decide on a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly let them look into their maps.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very well possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP chief as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters had dismissed the bowl-moller course.
A repeat of this direction would not be possible.
Molterer, however, reacted carefully to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tries to interfere in the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes in opposition or into the coalition is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed within the ÖVP.
BZÖ Chief Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
“To prevent red-black, we are ready to take on government responsibilities,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, which is being organized this year by the EU Presidency country France.
In her speech to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Member of Fidesz of the European People's Party, drew attention, in particular, to educational segregation, since it is one of the most serious violations of Roma children, and it is also the biggest obstacle to their application.
The high-level conference was opened by French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The participants included representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizen organizations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the press office of the EP members of Fidesz, Járóka has drawn attention to the fact that, in addition to discrimination in the search for jobs, Roma would be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
“The vast majority of Roma youth have no middle-school education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a higher education degree.”
Mr Járóka further emphasized that education is a fundamental human rights that plays a key role in enforcing other human rights.
Investing in early training of Roma children could strengthen the economy of EU member states.
In the opinion of MEPs, it is important that these connections become aware of as broad a circle as possible - that is, Roma and non-Romas.
Because the sooner a Roma student begins school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and revenue tax, they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma have to be secured the right to high-quality education - poor and segregated education must be discontinued," said Járóka.
As the Member stated, a common, goal-oriented and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the disintegration process in the education sector and to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination guidelines are properly respected.
“We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens,” said Járóka.
Since last year’s Congress in Berlin, the summit is being held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at the European and national levels, in the sense of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities”.
CSU: Grace on Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein is decided.
Despite the election debacle, no heads are still rolling, at the head of the Bavarian CSU the staff debates were postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is just how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of vote will be decided at the extraordinary party congress on the last weekend of October.
However, the duo has already shown that it doesn’t want to stick to their armchairs.
They want to soothe the angry group and the party base, which a day after the "Bayern tsunami" demanded personal consequences in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career peak - the Christian-Social Union reached 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they were able to secure only 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU has been a “allergist” in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern state that is also important to the Hungarian economy, they will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of internal party restructuring, the potential successor of Huber, Vice President and Federal Agricultural Minister Horst Seehofer is also involved in the exploration team, which conducts with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing "free voters" exploration talks about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list of “free voters” Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance first exploited the Huber-Beckstein Duo to then mercilessly deserve the ambitious politician.
The CSU leadership now focuses all its forces on the stabilization of Beckstein.
In this transitional process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the threads out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called September 28 "the bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks toward the CDU - in his view, the CSU deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to the success at national level in 2005, is not put back on the feet with a joint force act, Merkel will not be able to become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a hell of her disappointment over the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s land loss will not have a negative impact on the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however: the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best ever in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition deputies came to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegalities in the counting of the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
Although the 10-million-inhabitant state has been without opposition for decades, the counterparty gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS) has seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who would accept the opposition in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "re-receive his presidential mandate in 2006."
This is why the ODS has even taken a distance from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming economically increasingly dependent on Russia’s rising prices of natural gas imports. Loans have even been taken to alleviate the price increases, and the country has also taken part in the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the system of gas pipeline led by the country, anti-Lukas to the Russians. So in the background of the expectations of the opposition there was hope that Ukraine wanted to improve its relationship with the EU.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections provided a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis was placed on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings – such as the exclusion of a third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD quick report already criticized the campaign on Monday - oppositionists are therefore not likely to appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
In spite of all this, the opposition can see improvement in the political system: political prisoners were about set free, and Minsk is even prepared for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny recognition of the independence of the abolition Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine on paper considers a federative state a month since.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid of letting even one oppositionist into parliament."
The opposition does not plan to take protest measures in view of the results, but rather attempts to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have to face many problems here - opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, local authorities put stones in our way when distributing, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the elderly," Milinkevich said in an allusion that not even the most supported layer of retirees with the Lukashenko regime is agreed.
“Thanks to the country’s debt and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the ‘social security’, reminding the silence of a cemetery, begins to crumble,” says Milinkevitch.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have described the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: "People believe in deeds, not words." The absence of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be taken before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotating doors for the entrance and exit of officials.
From today, the measure will come into force against those smart people, who first stamp and then go drinking coffee during working hours.
The new “Anti-Falls Act” was introduced today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
"Turnable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through higher attendance rates and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
“Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism,” Brunetta once again emphasizes.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: “The choice of rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides."
All in all, so there is no breakfast during working hours anymore; stop with coffee or croissant.
Brunetta advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock does miracles."
During a meeting of the Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
In Rome, the minister announced that "within three months the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people are present at work each year."
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
"Their wage dynamics - the minister said - have been twice as large in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the rate of inflation."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have gathered together to counteract the Brunetta decree within the framework of Codacon’s supported appeal.
"While the Minister of Public Service profiles itself with figures on lower absences at work - as the Consumer Center writes - the people of 'acting lazy furs' are growing continuously.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable public servants have come together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree.
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is struggling for additional financial compensation for work-related illnesses; the planned extension of the compulsory home arrest of the sick worker, during which check visits can be made, and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention of occupational accidents is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain lifelong disabled.
For 2007, data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes nearly twice as many deaths as murders cause.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th National Day for the Victims of Work Accidents, in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how decisive the issue of prevention at work is," confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
He expresses his “great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing work, protecting injured workers, helping the families of the victims and raising public awareness.”
"An outrageous 'Basta' has risen up to this; understandable in tragedies that, in terms of their magnitude, trigger some whirlwinds in the media and public sympathy, but everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat themselves in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it needs to be decisively invested in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness of school settings on the part of young people feeding themselves on the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to pay attention to this phenomenon and not to distract it from its social seriousness; it is necessary to put in place and improve a legislative norm.
For his part, Chamber President Gianfranco Fini emphasized "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths forms an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on firm rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
“Occupational accident data seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is too high,” said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive tendency' to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"How do you believe that you are doing too little to tackle the phenomenon of accidents? You can fight it through various actions.
In our view, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – Mercandelli said – but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already beginning in school.”
"A further effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers toward a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is in demand.”
Mercandelli also spoke of "the progressive deterioration of protection for work accident victims" and denounced "the abolition of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years."
The aim is therefore to return to the worker a guarantee on insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident does not depend on voluntary or random donations, which are decided by a legislator at the time.
Mp3 player charged: risk of hearing damage
Listening to sound music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the Cssseri (the scientific committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report spread today in Brussels.
“From the report, it is clear that 5-10 percent of those who listen to loud music using portable music devices for at least five years a week risk permanent hearing loss.”
“I’m worried that such a large number of teenagers who normally put portable music devices and phones on a high volume will irreversiblely damage their hearing without knowing it,” said Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific findings – it is said by the EU – there is a clear risk that urges rapid action.
What really matters is to raise consumers awareness and make this information a common property.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the existing control systems again so that they are completely effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists - concludes the EU communication - confirm that one is rightly concerned and that the EU Commission will now, together with the other EU Members and those concerned, investigate the necessary measures to better protect children and adolescents from the noise that comes from portable music equipment and similar equipment."
There is already a European standard, which limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could arise from too much noise.
You can very much limit these damages, in which you engage in solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise screening.
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the European Union pointed out that if users of portable music devices listen to music for only five hours a week (more than 89 decibels), the legal limits on the maximum noise levels at the workplace were already exceeded.
Those who cross this limit risk total hearing loss within five years.
This would therefore affect 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, it's supposed to be over in March, in June we're drawing a balance sheet.
This is the process set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission met this morning at the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will prepare the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is complete, the city and municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - emphasizes Alemanno. "It will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility will remain the city and municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where a large project can be developed for Rome.
Their task will be completed in March and the Commission will be dissolved again, as such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June, as the mayor announced, we will introduce the strategic plan in which we will take advantage of the work done by the Commission."
Those who doubt the Commission's competence because of the lack of its opinion of liability, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics deals with everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in mind, to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective.”
"This Commission is neither an useless institution nor a wreckage: it is absolutely free of charge, it won't cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will make us think, it will employ the best minds of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to take a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to make a joint step into the future."
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, which "not only will limit itself to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further", not only with regard to the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here is a statement
A well-known American politician, who has much to do with being regarded as independent, wrote, “Barack Obama will become the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the US economy and maintained (and still does) relationships with enemy Islam.
The attacks on Obama are becoming increasingly violent, right now that elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very rude: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!
But in fact, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then there are also the polls; everyone says Obama will win with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the electoral cabin will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that has been kept hidden until the last.
“Tell what you want, then we’ll decide for whom we’re going to go, whether for Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now when the success of the black candidate seems so sure.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistake did Bush commit during his tenure? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers have lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, for the majority, Iraq remains Bush’s weakness.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they were not really concerned about the general credibility of those concerned with the information.
You don’t feel as lonely as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the big problems come from the cuts to the newsroom, that is, the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large public understands it, from being significantly shrinked.
A clear but complicated pessimism today meets the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong path.
In the local area, the executives are even at 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in which direction the web is going.
The main publishing groups are paving the way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the print press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has risen by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology, hoping "it brings something good for journalism".
The biggest crack in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for it.
56% of chief editors at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values with them, while at the local level they are only 23%.
Some think it has to do with “security at work.”
Operating managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at national level.
For journalists, that’s 30%.
The topic of "secure work" in the team (our "editors", note d. red.) is always an up-to-date topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it becomes a question of taking it or leaving it.
The editors-in-chief often receive very high wages, while the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros a month, plus pension and insurance funds.
As far as vacation is concerned, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holiday days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, often become "sick" throughout the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA STAYING IN GROOTTAFERRATA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be moved from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It will be investigated against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the counter-accord in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial town to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such relocations (which the prosecutor’s office had pronounced against) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and to get evidence to him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the White House’s $700 billion savings package: A large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in progress divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives, which is opposed to “the electorate in Washington” and the financial world and is hostile to the central and souther states.
This part of the party owes its rise in particular to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example just mentioned is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even already represents: not only in the United States, but also throughout the West and perhaps beyond will be affected by them.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events, which finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
Indeed, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the wealth of private households living in a single state.
This represents an immediate political problem for governments, namely how to behave towards the families affected, which are also a huge crowd of voters.
So the crisis appears economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have gone aside in itself and lost its right to speak: the enlightening evidence of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into different national and international conflicts, cannot find a common path.
Therefore, everyone is now expecting the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, in particular, the distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US in the economic situation has been saved without foreign aid.
And besides the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: two conditions not to be overvalued – under certain circumstances – to which no international organization or market will otherwise be able to resort in a similar manner.
The new emphasis placed on the state-national element is, by the way, in perfect harmony with the ever-growing importance that has recently been linked in the economy to a sector closely related: territoriality.
Paradoxically, just now that we were so convinced that we had entered a networked global empire, a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, the immaterial, it is that we must at once see how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Though they can be transported from one place to another in the world, they are nevertheless connected to the outermost with a tightly outlined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is at the advantage of another who lives in a harvestless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short input.
Who territory, who government, who says politics, says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, that is, the need for someone who knows how to manage things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing guidelines, including those of the economy, which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeply extending and in a sense still disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an impatience, an image of inappropriateness, a sense of distance, all directed towards a whole class of managers in the Western countries.
It seems so to be the conviction among many parts of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose wages are represented by the majority as ever more strange and pervasive.
The demand for leadership is therefore underground nurturing a branched but powerful movement of the empowerment of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This is manifested in the unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the unexpected shift of the collective labour state of the last time: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Bavaria and in Austria.
You get the impression that the old elite, its parties, its programs, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, are having increasing problems of understanding and therefore less representative value with regard to what is happening in the lower social layers of the West today, and is further reinforced and driven by the financial crisis to the overdimensionality.
In view of all this, it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a “mass rebellion.”
But keeping the eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super adhesive that goes up on walls
To defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to be able to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which seems to have nearly reached the target.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 sq cm, the researchers have managed to fix a body weighing 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged in a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and grinding paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the ability to hold the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "remove it from the wall without problems," says Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps so, but researchers are more likely to think of a less fascinating benefit, such as connecting electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall into the area of space.
For the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
The University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, California scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that clean themselves from dust by moving on a surface like hair and thus always maintaining a perfect adhesion.
Medicine: Never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, especially in summer, can cause serious health damage when taken at the same time with certain vital medications, as they can have an extreme effect on the body’s absorption of these medications.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly pointed to the risk of packed as well as fresh fruit juices associated with medication intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he re-alarmed that a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the absorption of certain vital medications.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medications such as antibiotics, anti-asthma, cardiovascular medications, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
The same drug agency warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix two years ago, emphasizing that they should be careful about what they drink in combination with drugs such as diazepan or metadon.
IS NOT ONLY GRAPFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by fruit juices is long.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, Director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are thus free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still any uncertainties, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or a doctor,” stresses the expert from the Ansa agency.
The Nobel Prize for Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize for Economics is given to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001 attacks, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in a New York Times article that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that received not little controversy in response and was held to the economist even years later, but proves to be completely correct today.
"I am surprised and also shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals as part of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public field of view," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank’s Executive Committee, Krugman is an “economist of great value,” but also a banalizer with a “very aggressive style that is aimed especially against the Bush administration’s excessive liberalism.”
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package appears
The day of OpenOffice.org 3.0 release has come; the open source software is gaining an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, among freelancers and in public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the audience with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now more spartan-designed starting menu, we have finally achieved a guaranteed compatibility with Apple’s operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, the latest ISO format.
Eight was also opposed to compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Some new features are also interesting, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email, including the ability to import PDF files in graphics editing modules while preserving the original appearance of the page.
Thus, you can now also generate "hybrid" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited multi-handed by different users, thereby avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the text processing system, each editor is assigned a frame to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the definitive result is expected to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Aside from Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
However, free costs can be an incentive for the dissemination of the program in private households, but it is also the case in the field of business where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration institutions and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means an optimal help for small and medium-sized businesses, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, to create presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase to run databases instead of the more well-known access; and finally Draw, a graphics module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be slightly exceeded with already reached 3 million and 600 thousand.
Also Kohl tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case will open mid-frame of the past Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who was third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver positively tested on Cera, the third-generation epo, previously with Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of cabbage are among those performed in the last few weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-samples now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and notified the Austrian officials, according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEMA INVORATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAGHT: IS ITALIA RACISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are accepted only with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated entirely to the topic of racism in Italy, from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls “the paradox of the north”: the northern regions are those where “the most integration and job opportunities” exist, and yet “the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support of the Lega North has been recorded.”
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants, introduced by the Lega, is also mentioned as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which the Pope and the President also emphasize: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The housing market for students does not experience any crises.
According to the latest investigation by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits: a whole crowd of students are losing their right to study because their families are unable to support them at this level," says Sunia leader Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the high demand on the part of students leads to a market deformation that also harmed other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of breaches: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, unauthorized subleases.
For Sunia there is a need for exceptional measures, which will result in lower rental prices due to a revision of the taxation.
If you look closer at the investigation, you will find that in Milan a sleeping place in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room costs 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros for a sleeping place of need, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Just a little lower the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà.
Only those in outdoor districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar neighborhoods.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room costs at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater importance in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above the average is demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinema halls
The historic cinemas close because of the beneficiary multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This image by director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the great urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, in the long run means the death for the cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the traits of a cultural crime.
“It’s like losing a friend with whom you walk a piece of street full of emotions,” says the director of the film “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso”, who won him the Oscar and the Grand Prix of Cannes 20 years ago. It’s the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a well-lost cinema forever.
The numbers supplied by the Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: in the last five years, the tremendous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have been shut down; these teaks paid for the most part the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This indicates that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational manner," says Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but the first thing is the preservation of the already existing one, because if a hall closes in the city, not all its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here is still the lack of budget for the fund of the trade association: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral standpoint that the government does not abide by existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be in need.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to decide to protect the ancient cinemas by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first of its kind in Italy to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historic center and in the periphery.
Foreseen measures also include tax benefits for cinema operators as well as benefits for the public with regard to local transport: it will be allowed to drive into the traffic-limited areas of the center and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
“It is a pleasant initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
But we certainly also need better audio and video equipment to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of Baghiera's "Supercinema", the place of my childhood and youth, was the key point that led me to start the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to not have to see the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the Anti-Mafia Law Office of Calabria against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
In handcuffs, Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for involvement in criminal associations of the mafia, at the time to a compensation of 10 million euros.
“In disrespect of every moral and legal standard,” the lawyers write, “the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities.”
Thus, it had been made possible for the mafia group – according to the judges – to invade the town halls officially and to co-decide the policy of public administration.
The president of the regional committee of Calabria Agazio Loyero does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter connections of local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who preserve a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, according to the police of the Piromalli clan.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but as early as 1991 – and also then due to alleged links between organized crime and local administration – local politicians had been expelled from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the middle-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot election.
He screamed scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He asked Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political and strategic reasons, but the judges declare in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to ask for an amendment to the A3 project.
From an interrogation action in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, it has been shown the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making the measures of the public administration identical to the interests of this clan.”
When the energy springs out of the waves, the big ones suddenly run up
It’s a non-sittering source of money that covers over 70% of the planet’s surface and only now seems the world’s big energy companies to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone now looks at, and also seeks to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of drawing energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; these studies have not been significantly intensified since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was lost, but now environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy demand could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to now rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was released, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are relying on marine energy generation.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said the spokesman for a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and weighs off the possibility of working with us.”
This is about the procurement of an approval from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a sign not to be underestimated, especially considering that in Alaska, the US continues to produce oil and that President Bush has only recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers speak of an increasing interest.
Still improved technologies.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still underway, not least because the latest doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as that in Portugal and Scotland are rather small and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with much greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected boxes.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the boxes up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn drives a generator.
The current is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this kind, which are only waiting for government authorization, and some of the energy obtained could also be used for military installations.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a warehouse and a parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator through the resulting rotation movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Recovery Research, there is a special interest in the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, sunlight and also waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
It is precisely the tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
