28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall.
The victim's brother stated that he couldn't imagine anyone who would want to hurt him, "At last he went up again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco judiciary said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a cook in Boston, had secured his dream job as a cook six months ago at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A Son & Daughter spokesman said they were "shocked and destroyed over his death."
"We are a small team working like a close family and we will be painfully missing him," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are in this difficult time with Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things for him finally went uphill."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," said Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook something for us, to prepare dinner for us,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother swimming with the stream.
"In everything that's going wrong in the world, he was that unshaped diamond that shined brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the SFPD notice phone at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview.
“I will always be put in drawers or get sticked from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and the reality.”
“I myself don’t want to always be perfect and successful.”
“Honestly, these things are more likely to sneak for me.”
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home in front of the TV with loose Dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
“We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” the Hollywood star said.
In her new movie "Mother's Day - Love Is Not a Play," Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be available with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues sought a little variety with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their vacation, hunting home to the feed pots in a fast gallop.
A mile at this pace, I was afraid.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
Then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses.
He led himself with his family through the ALRV facility, he didn’t even swing on a horse for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.
The sympathetic athlete does not lack awards.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has already admonished him.
Longer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met first winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
“This award means a lot to me,” says Langer, “because it will be awarded not only for sporting successes, but also for social commitment.”
For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.
He also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the double U.S. master winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of the German Sports" on Saturday.
The excellent athletes include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the fechters Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping jumper Alhard Schockhömele
Many of these sports legends arrived in Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept a distance from the great animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement TTP – that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree in tax and energy policy as well as in a policy issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
About the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them rather small in doubt and warns of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, Trump says.
He will massively slow down regulations, and he is strongly pushing for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to fulfill, has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That’s why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say they have to be invested in almost the same way.
The Democratic candidate announced the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans.
Trump could have internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policies are more clear.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and start coal production in the U.S.
Oil production should also be possible in protected areas so far, the Paris climate agreement he wants to terminate.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energy with her investment program and calls for: “A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.”
“It’s going to be either China, Germany or America – I want it to be us.”
But not only in terms of infrastructure – even in terms of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, they do not want to isolate the US from international trade – they simply want to better protect American jobs.
They should be better paid, Clinton says.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says it should not be changed.
But the big debate in the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.
His critics suggest that the budget deficit will only increase.
On the other hand, Clinton stands, who wants to at least demand from the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every woman fleeing has experience of sexual violence"
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.
Each has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them put her little son in her arms.
He looks in the room with big eyes.
His mother looks at the table.
Until she realizes she is being observed.
She smiles and kisses the little one.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the Chief Executive Officer of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and is dealing with, among other things, the topic of women on the escape.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single refugee women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Assistance.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
“It’s not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her flight,” says Bahr.
“Men are fleeing because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as carriers of hope,” she says.
In women, other reasons for escape outweigh: "Many are secretly stealing from it because they see no other way out."
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriage, homicides of honor, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives her away.
On the escape, this goes on.
“That tractors, for example, demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not uncommon,” says Bahr.
And women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who thinks that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany is crazy, says Bahr.
Even here, single women in refugee shelter are often regarded as inferior and worst-case abused.
This causes about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich to be traumatized, she estimates.
“Some of the children were certainly not voluntary.”
Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.
“Or they don’t dare to speak openly about what is experienced because the shame is too big.”
Because they often don’t know how to help themselves, they need more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for hosting refugees.
When asked whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of jurisdiction, some responded no.
In the Upper Pfalz and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government housing.
Even in Swabia, women alone refugees are not housed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government’s press spokesman.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central France, some community accommodations have floors or their own homes only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it said: “It is very important that men and women be housed separately.”
“If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are housed together, violence against women can occur.”
In particular, the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, the study states.
How much women feel this need for protection can be seen from the urge that there is to the house in Munich.
"Since we have been talking about existing, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant physicians strike: demands for new workfight measures
Deputy assistant physicians have called on their unions to approve new labor fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The British Medical Association’s Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on its entire council to approve more workfighting measures from early September.
The JDC said ministers would have failed to respond to concerns regarding the treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the election.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently quiet" about problems, which led to the rejection of the treaty.
"In view of this, the JDC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating workfight actions that begins in early September.
The disputes led to assistant physicians striking six times this year, the first overall failure in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be adopted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be forced to introduce.
Russia and Turkey: An Alliance of Foreigners?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow-lipped and he didn’t emit warmth, even for his restrictive conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "beloved friend" Putin - according to a report entirely five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan behaving as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to me to suggest the opposite.
But a long-lasting cooling, radiated by Putin, showed that Russia’s head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the throwing down of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's response at the time was burning.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling Russia in the back.
The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from President Erdogan the apology he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to win some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey harshly – particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by nearly 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed.
They count on a late-seasonal storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists along there, tomatoes along here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its response to the attempted assumption of power a weak response.
In addition, the ongoing resentment over the screw-up of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
For Moscow, this is a matter of course, which even has a profound fear of regime changes.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, as one analyst once described to me, to portray "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel displaced from the West and poorly treated and are now allied.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be signifying that after nearly three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference testified that they had not even striped the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found about Syria.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better for the two heads of state to at least talk to each other.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
According to the Bank’s CEO, the RBS brand should only be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced since when it almost collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentralized headquarters and stock listing will be switched to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller retail brands that will gain more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland, “The RSB brand will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now more to become a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am saying now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already testified that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to become a bank of brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of change.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000th win at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprinkles champagne after a double at Newmarket, bringing him 3,000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He made a milestone on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the rejoicing as he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner, had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best modern-day jockeys and it’s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been exciting fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already made 6,000 wins if he weren’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already rided winners in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft crash and was banned from drugs.
Three years ago, he initially had difficulty returning from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he’s not yet finished – Dettori once said he wants to continue competing until his at least 50th age.
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement from the Kremlin it states that Putin ordered "the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration" without giving any reasons.
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The Kremlin website says (in Russian) that he was later head of protocol and chief of staff of the government.
On his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it’s the government’s most important task to support your work as head of state regarding draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This move has turned Moscow mysterious.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest acquaintances and works for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man once lauded as a potential president would suddenly want to lead Russian environmental policy - encountered great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation in early 2012 to entrust me with this very complicated post - you could almost say - difficult post for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical fight last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, producing the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly Thursday before announcement of his dismissal.
At the set there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident,” he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character is written out from the series that follows a team of FBI agents are expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played at Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been there since the first season of the series in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heart into it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The scheduled broadcast of the 12th season is scheduled for September 28th.
Mysteries about fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help with the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spied from a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower" approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 inclined ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was one of the first to go from the countryside to the bridge.
He said, “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses to an engineering of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fitting.
Almost 79% of the total bridge decks are in place, and the final section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure is a forward-looking construction project.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the North Tower Deck under construction, we had to close the remaining gap on the northern or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
Heavy, as the tolerances that the team was working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown from their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station struck alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim safely while their boat was moving on their own.
"We saw the boat turning around them and imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, head of Moelfre's rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already pushed the boat out of reach until we left it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a boe without a rescue jacket.
They all arrived on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
While the boat engine had an emergency stop, it was detached from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was centered.
Someone was watching over these men today.
Heavily injured - Man bites his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police said yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal stuff.
Instead, the alcoholic offender cut his ex-girlfriend’s clothes.
When she came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured to the hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
Then she alarmed her sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she couldn’t get him to leave the apartment.
She went out of the house with her companion.
On the street, they met the man’s ex-mate.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds cheap apartments in Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be put into a much stronger duty in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 affordable homes in the coming years?
The SPD is proposing a "action concept of housing" for the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: who is going to build the cheap homes?
There is a lack of regulation so far.
Christoph Bratmann, chairman of the SPD group, says: “We agree with the Greens that anyone who wants to build on urban areas will have to identify 20 percent of all housing as social housing in the future.”
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in stock.
However, the main issue in the town hall is, Bratmann says: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as far as possible 20 percent of the housing as social housing.”
A new urban housing funding program, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann, "there is no agreement between the groups at the moment."
The CDU wants to make as few regulations as possible for investors.
The Left wants harsh rules for investors.
Nevertheless, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is undergoing an aggravation.
If the action concept is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear if we will get the professionals.
However, the program is not yet fully available: the approximately 1,260 new homes, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another 1,300 cheap housing, whose funding will expire in the coming years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, planning spokeswoman Nicole Palm said, bonds that had now run out of the city should be purchased.
Furthermore, it is necessary to think about bringing homes back to price binding.
This is possible in the West City.
In one blow, the problem could be solved.
At the end of the year, the deadlines in the west city expire.
Approximately 1800 apartments could be brought back there to the price liability for cheap apartments.
This is what the owners want, not the housing companies.
Because if the number of social housing in the west city increases again drastically, one moves away from the goal of so-called mixing.
A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few districts should no longer exist.
The Greens expect there will be more movement in the debate.
Holger Herlitschke, chairman of the group group, says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must go on the boat."
It has focused on more building sites for single-family houses.
This does not mean that no further compromise can be reached.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worthwhile
It is fascinating to see the world change.
That teenagers and kids no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens has been complained by many in the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and making them more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and lastly to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest fell slightly before the game was released in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped to search for the sofa.
In the US, the game led to a substantial increase in steps that the "average" person takes back every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to improve performance.
Many public health enlightenment campaigns that want people to "take 30 minutes," "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" came across deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly exercise reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to list them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on hunting.
As always, there are amazing players who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk around a door.
What the hell?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity before, they gave us no reason to exercise as this game does.
The new one will lose its appeal and use will decline over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's tournament
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Easily on the beam.
Stunning on the floor.
Overall brilliant.
And now, finally, Olympic winner.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed for the multi-fighting title on Thursday and increased the gap between her and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles turns on the swing beam during the women’s single multi-player final in art tournaments at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-fighting title and overall fifth as she strengthens her reputation for being the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport over the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton of her said she's "the best turner I've ever seen."
She was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after each won gold and silver in the single women’s multi-competition finals in the art tournaments at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday as she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of retiring team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not really true.
Part of their ground exercises – which include their typical Tumbling Pass – are tailored to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman’s mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became the strength.
She hasn’t lost a multi-fight competition since summer 2013, a series of wins that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led through two rotations easily, the image was deceiving.
Swivel beams and ground tours - in which Biles holds the World Championship title - laid awake.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the swing beam - and put one more on it with a 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman embraced her gently as they waited for her final result - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Bile's shiny red, white and blue eyeliners as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old captain, named by the Americans "Grandmother", had a lead.
After her ground exercise, she threw kissing hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims shot in serial killer case while listening to music in the car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in the first Phoenix serial killer case while chatting in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12, while the car was parked at an entrance, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, is read in the report.
Police announced that the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to take a closer look at whether it was associated with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two injured in four months of attacks in predominantly Hispanic residential areas.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is assumed to be the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as spherical fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the few of his fellows, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't allow myself to do that.
What’s not true at all—of course, you’ve got involved in it,” she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institutionalize him.
“My first answer was ‘I didn’t know people are still doing it,’” Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walking aid.
Edmund was unable to sit or crawl until his third age, and he still cannot speak.
But he's slowly making progress.
He can walk and cycle with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund invented for "Please sing something for me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language, she says. Edmund invented a few signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and predictions may vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I was constantly asking, what is going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t been asking for the forecast for a long time because I don’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives rise to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to proclaim emergency status on Friday, with more rainfall expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help with the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said the Tangipahoa municipality alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be used across large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, an early flood warning system was implemented on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger as these will slowly flow through the trampled rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 09:00 on Friday.
Rescue teams were still flooding in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those who were rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency personnel had saved all three in a large military truck and taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had "spread rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rainfall and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning reported 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said the soil has been substantially filled by the rain since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rainfall and road flooding caused rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary broadcaster WWL reported that a counsellor in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
Municipality official Robby Miller said authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets from flooding.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelter was set up to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags provided to the residents who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last big flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County’s emergency manager Rupert Lacy said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
He said a handful of houses were reported flooded on Thursday, but no one has been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen before,” Townson said, “and it’s still coming.”
Mahaj Brown, Six, "Bounded by Bullets", Survives Shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week for the second time a 6-year-old boy has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents reported that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the leg, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was aware when he was transported to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was holed through with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the broadcaster.
I just can't believe that.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the broadcaster that he is expected to recover.
He should have started first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, the broadcaster reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether they may be among the injured men of the perpetrators.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to have been a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge sleeves for storm rifles traced back to various storm rifles sewed over the scene of the crime.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, there were sleeves.
Thus, there seems to have been several armed fighters here, who were very actively involved," policeman Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and police are currently investigating the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-cut on her arm as she played in front of her home in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine in the women’s Olympic team in the gym, and for more than one reason.
First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who seemed inspiring for many young girls of other skin colours.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman who is Jewish and Madison Kocian who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has strengthened the black and Hispanic female presence at the forefront of this sport.
Over the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but this is not how gym classes all over the country look.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to get into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four women in the team and this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are mainly in private gym clubs, maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishings, travel-clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families). The list can be continued as desired.
The majority of these gym clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive all their training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Simone Biles’ coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez’s coach Maggie Haney have both trained their athletes since they started the gym.
We need to provide the communities with countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie for more affordable and more accessible training.
I founded my 20-year gym foundation.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide youth with high-quality gyms that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as educational and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the gym and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant physicians want to organize more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant physicians who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcefully introduce the contract, saying the NHS would be in a “no-man country” and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant physicians are expected to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at unhospitalized times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Committee on Assistant Doctors, said in a statement last night: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current labor crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress needs to be made and the time runs out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through talks came to a reluctance by the government to participate and sometimes to an ear-dumping silence.
This came from a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt has to act now, lift the imposition and address the worries of the assistant doctors.”
If he does not, the assistant physicians have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further workfighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April envisaged a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialist physicians were involved to provide coverage to physicians on the strike chain.
The ministers had hoped to be able to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant physicians who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, urged the assistant physicians to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Labour-fighting measures do not achieve anything of the already overloaded teams and service providers, and only prepare patients, nurses and their families to worry, need and interruption."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistant physicians and have responded positively to the concerns regarding guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a job break, training skills, mutual recognition of the curriculum, continuing training leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was in February with the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with May B.
The <0xC2><0xA3>2 per day medication that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a <0xC2><0xA3>2-a-day medication after authorities have recommended administering this to more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-coagulant drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year take to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year take to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form linings.
When the lining breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot looses, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the UK company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
NICE’s draft guideline, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke – often with disastrous consequences.”
Fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness Leads to Election Fraud in Muslim Areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored like a devastating government report disclosed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to “hypersensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion.”
The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an Ant-Corruption King, said the intimidation of voters for religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up lock ribbons outside election cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry an identity card to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter just has to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they give their vote to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
“It is not only for electoral fraud, it is also intended to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that is accompanied by it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that current mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litanie of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the consequence of an imitation in which one person votes as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He said he was particularly alarming about the fraudulent mail election – where older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to elect a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to cleanse the electoral system, including carrying out identity cards to prove identity.
“As evidence, pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, particularly communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
“There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behaviour due to ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing mail election documents to stop “wagers.”
The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for harsher registration checks to prevent the election list from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they have given their voice to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic verification of a person’s nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic mail selection.
Forbidden political activists to process complete mail elections and envelopes of mail elections.
The police give authority to set up barriers for electoral stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates a charge for intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photography in electoral stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in electoral stations (except Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the election cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
“The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy inappropriate because of a litanie of corrupt and illegal practices,” he said.
He was acknowledged sufficiently guilty on a number of grounds - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "abhac controls" of the electoral registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's court judgment in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.
As the mother of parliaments, our country has a proud heritage, but the concerning and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy after Kate's cyclist and other famous Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have gone beyond border and band this week about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive doubler of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But this summer, the 24-year-old Olympic is by far not the only athlete fighting for gold that has its own famous double - at least not if you can believe in social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians who have more than just a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. team member in bow shooting Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate’s double on the cycling track, many people on the Internet pointed to how a certain archer could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archery crew member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images he looks horribly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star appeared.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that he was heard from childhood that he looked like Leo.
“I don’t even see much similarity, except for face hair,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a pretty guy, so I guess I take this as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly focus even more this year: the unfolding resemblance between the British wide jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes is expected to be able to go through as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years to Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
This user believes Nathan is the Inception actor’s “athletic version”
Another ongoing comparison has been drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sun-burned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to resemble a "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others have noticed the similarities as well
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user expressed her satisfaction that “the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.”
In fact, U.S. football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner in the gym Gabby Douglas, which has her own beautiful, broad smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologises for his statement that Chinese swimmer "has died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming pool outraged viewers of the CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "has gone like Mief" and during the race like "a pig died."
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle float.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board to the CBS commentator team to give more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, departed like Mief, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swimed the second stage of the 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to fill the gap toward China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"???
The fool didn’t realize that they were still on the show.”
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming stack for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and harshly, in which many spoke of him
Twitter users didn’t hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We're sorry that the comment about a swimming performance was broadcast."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized over 90 times to people who responded to comments via Twitter
Scott Russell apologized on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald’s comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized last night to our spectators on broadcast and our followers on social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron’s comments referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in the show and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming stage on the CBC Olympic show," he said.
“I referred to the swimmer’s performance and not to her as a person.”
Of course, there was no intentional disregard and I am very sorry.”
Buyer in Primark outraged at woman trying underwear shamelessly in the middle of the store
The buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
To make the situation worse, she counted what she looked like in it, removed her and put her back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried four pairs of underpants at a store at the Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she dressed up again and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "People could not believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the exhibit, dressed up her own pantyhose and trousers and tried them.
“She didn’t even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it – she just stood there, freaky like Oskar.”
"Everyone stared when she took off the underpants she obviously didn't like as she put her back on the shelf."
She repeated the same with three more underpants before she finally decided she didn’t like anything, dressed up again and left.
"She didn't seem to bother someone watching her - or thinking about the person who might buy the underpants she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that another person wore and were not washed."
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "As I found out, the staff tried to pull the clothes out of sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate going home with a new pair of underpants and finding out that another woman wore them and moved out again and they weren't washed."
A spokesman for Primark said, “Primark is aware of the incident that took place Tuesday, August 9, in our Folkstone branch.”
All eligible products have been removed from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.
Whether you are approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the shot for your robber.
When approaching you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the line of shot," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.
Then hit him with the knee in the bar and twist the weapon out of his hands while the attacker is curved from pain. Hit him in the face with the run and move backwards while they direct the weapon on him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of shot, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time shift the weight to the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of his handle before they move backwards and target the gun on him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly what Mizrachi is doing.
But remember that in a robbery, it’s safest to hand over your money—unless you’re not Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright picks up his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious examination of his immune system and choking reflex — by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, took his trains on a Euro banknote, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a washing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before bleaching each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he would be allowed to do.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the washing button of a pull-out toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he milked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestines by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railways on railway stations to toilet sink buttons, the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
“Also as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, soil, worms and mud water.”
In the film, he certainly met his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its test spray showed a luminometer number of more than 4,000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after its luminometer number was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, "It's close to the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet."
There is nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything here because it's disgusting here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstorms that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a wider context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added, “Let me say it like that – I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I ordered him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.”
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was pretty difficult.
I’m glad we took some of these dirty treats on film.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of lactic acid bacteria were associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.
Social Family Destroyed Before Delogging Social Home in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left her social home after a dislocation with a damage of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 for terrorizing her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After being forcefully removed from their property, shocked housing co-operative employees found the property in irreparable condition.
The walls had clamping holes, wooden shelves were torn apart, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated onto the walls.
The family was relocated and it is believed that they now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don’t have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will probably be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror that the family had caused included street fights with baseball bats, intimidators of local residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and curses.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, was ordered for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage has been found
In the estate where drugs have been traded in the past, the wooden shelves have been torn apart
Neighbors said they saw her fighting on the street and had to be regularly called to the police.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the property this week after giving them an extended 11-week period to volunteer.
The dislocation was praised by easier neighbors who said their lives were made to hell.
One said, “They didn’t care about anyone.”
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we say to the police here are incredible.
"Tomorrow we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - that's what we're not used to!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said it would have ceased the family to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which police were called regularly for 20 years.
On the overgrowing side of the parish house, rubbish and old toys were thrown down
“It’s a shame that the tenant didn’t take any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as dislodging is always the final step Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging
Home administration workers will now have to clear rubbish hills that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of <0xC2><0xA3>1,700.
Skeldon was fined after she pleaded guilty of possession of a Class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now assumed to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will dislodge tenants who do not comply with house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said that the removal was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
“This goes to those who think they can behave without self-accusation, as well as those who have been harmed by such a behavior,” she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after deep-flying military jet overflight beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force Plane Launched an Incredible Fall Flight
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when frightened tourists start to panic after a deep-flying jet drops down a full beach.
Dramatic video shots showed how the military plane flew nearly tangible above the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle engines without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By on social media, said: "It really flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added, “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling on me.”
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires, but the air force insisted that security was at no time endangered.
Area fires this summer destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, which also killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today stated that due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - the pilot had to fly so deeply, which restricted his sight.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with worries against Seville
Seville - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in a duel for the Spanish Super Cup outside against FC Seville, the back game rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must waive Neymar, who plays the Olympic soccer tournament with Brazil, at the powers of the lower cup finalist and the ruling European League champion, among others.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter is also missing Stegen.
The German suffered a tape dip in the knee during the training, thus resolving the Barca question at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for number one status for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far waived a clear decision in this regard and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen took the lead in most other competitions.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated in a test game by Liverpool on Saturday with 0:4.
Lionel Messi and Co. didn’t really know how to convince them even in the 3:2 in the sampdoria trial on Wednesday.
Seville, in turn, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after extending the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de España".
Barcelona has been the record winner in this competition with 11 successes so far.
Ma Long in her own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and title defender Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
In this way, the World Ranking First won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Touring Finals and Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese managed to enter the final as expected and made the title with each other.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic cliff was former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retired to the tribune and left their protectors alone in the fair competition.
"The matches so far I have played for my country."
“I’m playing for myself in the final,” Zhang said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral.
Ma really had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
Afterwards, he determined the pace on the record and left Zhang only 13 points in total.
Due to Ma’s superiority, the expected captivating match did not evolve.
Nevertheless, there were sufficiently stunning ball changes.
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarterfinals against German European champion Dimitrij Ovcharov, was subsequently under medical treatment, had to "ultimately" satisfy himself with sheet metal.
The Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourths in similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump acknowledges “enormous problems” in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now acknowledged weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican state of Utah.
A rare moment when the normally large-tracked and self-confident multimillionaire expressed concerns, correspondents reported.
Having thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the struggle for the White House are now growing.
“We have enormous problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians, whom he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
The fault was false reports about his candidature, he reappeared his well-known media grims.
Republican strongholds shaking
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton were equal.
Other institutes see Trump at the forefront, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he wants to stop Clinton’s rise again: “As I have done so far.”
“It will either be successful, or I will have a very nice, long vacation.”
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
If it doesn’t end up being rich for him because of political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party allegedly threatened to withdraw funds to support his campaign if he could not present better poll scores.
Instead, the Republican’s candidates for Congress are more likely to be taken under the arms.
Olympics: Trieste fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes are threatening to unravel after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, had delivered a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team leadership by the doping controllers.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to undertake its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
“Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent IOC measures, the IAAF will carry out an evaluation,” an IAAF statement said.
“He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and performed as Ferguson Rotich, taking the sample and signing it,” said Kenya’s Chief of Mission, Stephan Arap Soi.
He owned the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
In 2015, Ferguson Rotich won World Cup four in Beijing over 800 meters.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is reported to have informed his country’s athletes of upcoming doping tests against cash payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested when he returned to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation by the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
The announcement of the IOC’s more than 2,000 doping target checks before the Rio games was unusually previously pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
Subsequently, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose fight against doping complies with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a major runner nation.
The country’s athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports have repeatedly alleged that doping is easily accessible in Kenya and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It has been demonstrated that this sport has been doped comprehensively and systematically.
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classicism and fulfilled a youthful dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he whispered.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this stage, Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She reminds herself of her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically exceptional.
Then there was Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
“She resembles me very much, my Italian character I have as a Roman woman,” Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an immensely generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"
Driving is a necessity for him.
You see it in every one of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly up-to-date: "This piece is about prejudice and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined IS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London to join ISIS last year, died reportedly in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned about her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group’s fortress in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only good is that – as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone – prevent people from ever making that decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane towards Turkey and subsequently boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain candidate for the Supreme Court in case of a Garland election victory
Harry Reid, Senate Democratic leader, is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge in the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Reid said during a teleconference on Thursday that he expects Clinton to choose Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he would speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination as lake and helper to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidential office.
Treats wants nude calendar for "Women and Men"
The Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to release a Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017 in the 1970s.
But instead of famous naked people, they would like to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his naked magazine is different from old-school playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the calendar does so too.
“We have to return to the depiction of timeless and classical nakedness where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass escape
“Whoever doesn’t adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed suitcases,” says Ercan Karakoyun, president of the Gülen-near foundation Dialogue and the World.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany expects tens of thousands of protection seekers fleeing from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be “a few hundred thousand,” believes the union’s chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh action taken by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term, with a few hundred thousand seekers of protection from Turkey in Germany if the Erdogan regime continues to fight against minorities and the democratic opposition," said Ali Toprak, president of the "World" on Friday.
Because the government had already overwhelmed Kurdish strongholds with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds were on the escape within Turkey.
After the crushed coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.
“It cannot be that a state that accepts refugees itself produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitic cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds.
“They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years,” said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association called for the German government to "position itself as sharply as Austria stands against Erdogan and his supporters".
In Germany, too, there is a “witch hunt” against Erdogan critics.
For the first time in the last few months, I haven’t felt safe in Germany.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition officials.
The branding as a Gülen adherent destroys teachers and other academics' professional existence.
"Whoever does not adapt and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, before the coup, the Turks represented the largest group of asylum-seekers recognized for political persecution in Germany.
As of June 30th, they were 11,386 people, almost 29 percent of all asylum-eligible recognisers (39,625).
This survey does not include those fled from war, poverty or lack of prospects.
Asylum entitled under the Fundamental Law are exclusively politically, i.e. on the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals don’t get anything from the summer elections – and holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot vote for the Landtag.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern you understood.
In 2021, the election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Swedish parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it is not stupider than so far: summer holidays, heat and country election campaign - that bites.
The locals who are to be convinced by the voters are on vacation.
The majority of the holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they cannot vote for the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and in the end count voices are only hard to find.
Until 4 September 2016, on the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the election campaign go shortly past the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It becomes exciting how strongly newbie AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalition-suitable.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is doing an almost unobtrusive election campaign.
He travels around the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary wordless predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the blooming of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, their “we do this” has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him now the beautiful office.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is to do at the wrong time in the right place.
She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large rallyes twice; Merkel’s Bundestag election circle is in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxony than Mecklenburgers and Vorpommern.
"There was probably a majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, complained recently in the NDR.
But it’s no harm to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely waives the usual campaign stands on market places and outside shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
That, Kokert says, only plays a “subordinate role.”
The Union, too, has noticed that it is removing the base in the countryside, that it has to strive very hard to find a wire again to the people.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vast areas of the country there is hardly any.
However, the advice of CDU electoral fighter Kokert to his fellow fighters is also self-disclosing: "You must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because there is much at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats lately laid 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in polls, are likely to make a leap into the Landtag.
They make the holiday not a modern virtue and put their election campaign largely on the Internet.
“On-line elections,” state president Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green electoral campaigners go on trace search for native voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just turning on a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lakes and still finds it beautiful.
Her impression: "Election vacation in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 rehabilitation: restaurants suffer from blocking
The speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to worry about.
For those responsible for the construction works, which begin at 5:30 in the morning and end only at 8:00 in the morning, there is praise everywhere.
"They have done everything quite zackfully," Elvira Tetzlaff says from the jet tank station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south by the beginning of the week at the mid-term scheduled, until the end of October everything is to be finished.
We are also praised for the accommodation of those responsible for the construction works, for example when it comes to the establishment of aid entrances.
Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and the connection to Rottenburg thus also exists again, the traffic situation within the town has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel the B 27 again on both sides from oftendingen.
Evacuation traffic through the town seems to be back.
"There were some substantial complaints," said Florian King, the deputy chief officer responsible for the traffic management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherain had to struggle with more traffic noise because many sleigh paths were looking for themselves and trusted their navigation rather than the signage.
This caused some trucks to get lost in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not met, the municipality further requested the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant overflows," King says, who once made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have already been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was 77 km/h in the Tempo 30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen at B 27 it is only a little comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen don’t like to look at the cards.
But that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales decline in them, lets everyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Anyone who has less to do with the "end-client", that is to say, for other companies, doesn't have any consequences for the renovation.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highly slight decline" at the Maier car company, but also admits that of course "the running clientship is missing".
The locals are most busy along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
This is already existence-threatening.
Not only he, but all the cafes have “struck hard.”
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro sales.
Revenue losses are “more than 50 percent.”
The road rehabilitation has dropped its operation "two years back".
Half of his employees had to be dismissed.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt replied to a question from Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, stating that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation at B 27.
Göhner knows of other counties where something like this was handled more generously.
In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently passing by due to the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular client will return after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of B-27 construction work on his clientele the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.
In the name of the fight against terrorism, the laws are constantly screwed.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a toleration status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the Reconciliator.
All his proposals are “politically reasonable” for the coalition partner, the Federal Interior Minister says in the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overwhelm anyone.
Other, further issues would initially be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he was attached to results and to an "achievable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière lasted a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, encouraged: that a new security agency should take care of the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU rules on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security agencies is also not surprising.
Partly, de Maizière is launching a second run for proposals that were not yet to be made with the SPD: he wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and knock off jihadists with double citizenship on the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He nevertheless considers this reasonable and also does not demand anything that has no chance with the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas presented de Maizière as well.
They have it partly in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more opportunities for imprisonment of people before deportation.
Refugees who are targeted to the country should first have their smartphones checked and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerations for refused asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than so far – for example those who commit crimes or consciously throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things also do not work out and leave questions open.
And on some points – for example, in the case of inequal treatment of patients – the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it is not possible to dispute that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
Many people were also concerned about security given the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply occupied with could not be ignored even during election campaign times.
Internal security has been enormously focused.
Only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
Uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, the two sides have been high.
First a dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy ideas collection of some of the Union’s interior ministers, in which the heads also demand a burka ban and a departure from double citizenship.
De Maizière is also struggling for conciliatory tones here.
He doesn’t stop a double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening it doesn’t make sense.
In the case of a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has to be shown.
There's a lot in it that could cause a dispute.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the topic of internal security.
The party chief Sigmar Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that will help to further increase security.”
Volkswagen is still going through.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery numbers are increasing worldwide.
But not in all markets it goes round.
In the recall action, there is a whirlwind around a term.
Volkswagen will start in the second half of the year when it comes to delivery.
Europe’s largest car manufacturer can, despite the diesel deal, continue to show a plus in the past year thanks to its many brands and some well running markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thereby again loaded the total sales, as the company listed in the Dax reported.
The VW brand sold 1.8% less vehicles worldwide in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second largest market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than last year.
In Germany’s home market, the deliveries cut off by almost a sixth.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann drew the weakest figures from July, mainly to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets there has been a buying restraint due to "changed economic framework conditions".
In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also burdened, a spokeswoman said.
In the U.S., where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also a minus.
Big support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, Lower Saxony’s mainly affected home brand continues to be glimpsed by the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a decrease in delivery of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales increase from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during that time, 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with software.
In Germany alone, VW calls for approximately 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the upgrade, VW reaffirmed that the upgrade of the cars has no negative effects.
After the vehicles have been upgraded, there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The car manufacturer issues to the customer a "guarantee-like" certificate after the upgrade, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
The reason is legal subtleties.
The Focus reported that Volkswagen is now giving its German customers a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport on Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
“VW has to fully fulfil the requirements of my investigative commission and the KBA.”
"Deviations from this are not accepted," Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said.
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power will not deteriorate after the upgrade and all relevant vehicle type-approval values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term “warranty” but does not, as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "warranty", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers may come to a workshop with an engine damage half a year after the conversion - and this could be due to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer interest to avoid any other damages that have nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, resulting in uncertainty regarding possible warranty arrangements, as it was said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "warranty".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee demands from rich savers penalty interest in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Chief Bank Officer Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on tour or day money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers should not be afraid to pay for their savings interest.
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay their 0.4% penalty interest.
This fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September to private and corporate customers for deposits over €100,000 on Giro or Day Money accounts.
“The first 100,000 euros are free.”
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
He has been holding 40 million euros for some time, which could be raised from one day to the next and which he cannot use.
"They are on the central bank account with me and cause 0.4 percent costs," the chief banking officer said.
“I can’t lay $4,000 for every million.”
The costs are now transferred according to the polluter payer principle.
Simply putting the cash in the vaults of the Raiffeisenbank would be too dangerous: “I’ve already seen four attacks, I don’t want the fifth one yet!”
Most customers have understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Few have moved to other banks.
The Co-operative Association of Bavaria stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course incurs considerable costs for all banks."
To carry them alone is "business-relatedly not permanently possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
With penalty interest for deposits from three million euros, the Thüringen Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its 2014 Skatbank store.
Michael Kemmer, chief executive officer of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay overall fees for deposits, so competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is too strong."
A banker said at Lake Tegern there was “a client whose wealth was a little more exuberant.”
“This can be a problem for a small bank” if she keeps money for free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The co-operative association of Bavaria "is currently not known to any other banks that calculate an expenditure reimbursement for deposits of private customers," spokesman Ernst said.
The president of the Federal Association of German Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go negative to the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is tough, and it is threatening the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany won’t let this in width.
Destination plates: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment part to overseed it under the pseudonym Not AllLonelyMenMiddle Age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-debated resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical items, but rather due to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It’s also not a horde of hobby collectors – it has an emotional significance: older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results right?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I run amid a busy street in Soho, wear a modest gray suit and wildly stumbl before I stand, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Although Soho’s heart slowly loses its charm – hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were based – there are still a handful of fantastic record specialties.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part where I stand close to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20) is for a day for a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn’t follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items that he sold when he was young and broken.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things that I was probably a bit too young to buy for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
This is my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are true to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy back their old records.
Of the conversations I had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
"Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom of followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took a bump on the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling an emptiness or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
That’s what I’m doing as a collector, and I think that’s what’s happening to a lot of people.
It is an easy way to get involved mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" a staff member flutters from a stack of records.
An ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I scroll through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "tropheenaspect" of the revival.
“Someone just recently came in here and said, ‘I don’t own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf.’”
This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-loading, less music-loading.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who are coming in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience as I go in.
There are couples around the 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the shops mentioned above - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz sounds from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but nagging mental trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes looking at the variety of records available for sale.
She’s more like a window walk than a big shopping.
It doesn’t earn much, so collecting plates isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or otherwise, but the beauty of records is...” it’s driving off with a lovered sigh.
I don’t know how to explain it – it’s truly unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be mocking the jeans-hotpants, I’m watching a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just purely decorative, some up so far that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art."
But given that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, they disregard, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning walking through Berwick Street record shops and leaving through records while avoiding the staring gaze of a strange, 30-year-old fake moderator who scrutinizes over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland Shark is the longest alive vertebrate - Video report
Scientists say that the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrate animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, the investigator of the shark, says the record was for a female, which is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French Court Rejects Offer on Removal of Businesses in the Jungle Refugee Camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to destroy dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to break down 72 provisional stores where people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be destroyed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which poses a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also argued that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional businesses, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "absolutely comprehensible."
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who live "in extreme precarious conditions."
He said the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the destruction was the Jungle Book Kids’ Café of the camp, which operates for non-profit purposes and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids’ Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure “would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old.”
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant on Friday estimated that the number of people living in the jungle has increased to over 9,000 – the highest number so far – after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic period, cycling professional Tony Martin does not want to be overcome.
“I keep an eye on the World Cup, stay confident and fight,” the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the sugar hat.
“It’s hard for me to comment on yesterday’s driving time,” Martin said.
He had to quietly analyze what reasons had led to the debacle.
At the time racing World Cup in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
“I’m going to look at everything we’ve changed recently.”
"This is also my position," wrote the three-time time racing world champion, who lost more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday on the 54.5 km.
Olympia: Tennis professional Siegemund missed semi-finals
Laura Siegemund's winning tour ended in the quarterfinals of Rio: The World Rankings 32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
34) clearly the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Victory moon, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to achieve her stroke once and worked powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) had a chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met British winner Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarterfinals of summer games had last been held in 1992.
Never had a German duo in a single Olympic semi-final.
Group to start up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people playing video games is a huge trend – Microsoft wants to benefit from it too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is flowing for the acquisition, Microsoft did not announce on Thursday.
Beam launched its offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and confront enemies as well as provide equipment.
Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is aimed at helping.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the startup, which has so far been headquartered in Seattle, Washington, moved to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, according to Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
For customers, therefore, the acquisition does not change anything.
Microsoft says Beam is integrated into the video game division around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by the online dealer Amazon - for nearly a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here's the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s razer has to adapt to the next generation of speed meters: In various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are intended to transfer pace singers particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailers from Vitronic in Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at serious accidents, where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on highway construction stations or bridges to be renovated with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complicated.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days in continuous measuring operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can be captured simultaneously across several tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as driving bans by time, strip and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the elevated state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer clutch.
To prevent it from simply being stolen, it is lowered in measuring operation, so that the wheels in the armored and by the way also fireproof outer shell disappear.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the flasher from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now in use.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently reordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK takes silver in 7-Rugby after Fiji Masterclass takes gold
Britain’s impressive performance in 7-rugby came to a sharp stop in the final Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji, when they were beaten with a score of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, back, line running and raw force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation award of the silver medal - Britain's fourth that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks' clear defeat, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But no matter what, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in the best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB — but it probably won’t — that at least a British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s chief coach Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This slack will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and made the attacks of GBs burst out of fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., it felt like riding on buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 as Osea Kolinisau crossed the corner.
With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he turned.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
An outstanding tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua played a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reappointment whistle and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou preached through further weak tackling of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's what it is.
GB made fundamental changes in the mid-time and filled the Fijian gap...for an entire four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long gone in favor of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, swing flags and danced on the tribune.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame set the i-topple with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced each other and GB kicked devastatingly beaten in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a short semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired by fighting the coach’s cancer to rowing victory
There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first rowing stroke to the last, 220 hard hive that entered the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
The echo of coach Robin Williams was present as they rowed to the second consecutive Olympic gold in the two without a taxwoman, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39th unbeaten effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes sliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the type of triumph.
Behind every gold rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn’t know if he would survive that day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.
If you don't, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky enough to start treatment in early 2014, off-season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances that is the right term at all.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediateness of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment on a mission in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It only repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a big thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wanted a better trainer or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a tough rhythm that their opponents couldn’t keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen called "stay in trial, stay in trial."
It is really important not to be caught up.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to do something great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before they make decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic winner.
It was so new for me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
It feels so much better,” she said.
Exemplary for clarity for 31 years
The managing director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water purpose association as an example for the large water producers.
This was said in the original tone some time ago in a post by the Bayerische Rundfunk.
A little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken honored the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group was considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the purpose association, including 28 years as managing director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Purpose Association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, produces approximately 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water supply contracts.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn’s mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterkeeper in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the purpose association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," the chairman said.
Outstanding events were the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation to farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the new purchase of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewals of water pipes.
There has been no stopping and innovations have been made again and again because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heartblood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Unterfranken.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller praised waterkeeper Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best waterman and he was a loyal boy.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult operation, however, was the pipe break at the high container near Kirchlauter on a January 3rd.
Here at minus 17 degrees will have to work all night so that the towns could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once because the high tank of Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who will succeed Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old said to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the illness was recognized by her son, she believed that she had to die.
Now eight-year-old Tiago has moved forward and now learns privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: when I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship state in Bargteheide - man shoots life mate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at 10:45 a.m. on Friday in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Kreis Stormarn) and injured her deadly.
"The man himself called us and said he shot his companion," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the flight, after him is publicly searched.
In the meantime, nationwide, because Sven S. could be on the way by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, browned and has a baldness.
Police have published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a baldness.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
Police are talking about a “relationship state”.
The victim was in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The police in Lübeck did not initially want to provide information on the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder offence."
"We are not saying more at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operation Command (SEK) was at the scene of the crime.
Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared millions of additional costs.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity funding are off the table.
It remains in the exemption from the renewable energy surcharge in the existing plants for so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I’m really happy that we finally succeeded in this after two years of tough negotiations.”
The European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel manufacturers to pay for the use of gases from the high furnace for their own electricity consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced will an EEG surcharge of 20 percent fall.
But this is not raised in the steel industry either.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the European Commission on self-power production.
Thus, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely defined.
Gabriel’s successful effort is of particular importance to the steel industry.
“In terms of our ‘Steel is the Future’ campaign, this is a first step.”
“Others have to follow.”
"In the reform of emissions trade, climate and employment goals must also be weighed," said Jörg Hofmann, CEO of IG Metall in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen as China, the world’s largest producer country, massively threw steel into the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of dumping prices.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed a bit.
On the one hand, import duties on import steel have shown an effect, and on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have increased.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prime Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Lastly, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced more than six percent less raw steel with 3.4 million tonnes than the previous month, the Steel Business Association announced on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the quantity produced now decreased for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been 2% below the previous year’s value.
The association expects an increase in emissions in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing Does Seniors Good
Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in teaching school she studied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Singing moves me—emotionally and physically,” she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful, and overall more alive, she says.
In addition, she does something good to her health and mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
Through regular meetings, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also been made by Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To talk and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."
Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler says.
Seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the pulp so quickly even in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, common singing had a much higher place, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia remember long-standing events.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz.
Focusing on your own voice and a predetermined rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers is a huge cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that one gets through singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
Showing yourself: If I practice for something for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
Good reasons to start singing are enough.
Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don’t sing alone – with 50 people singing, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the acquaintance circle sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with searching the Internet.
Anyone who wants to sing should absolutely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that applies to any age.
Cats are more sensitive than cats to young animal screams
Biologists in Hannover have studied the effect of crying cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miauen did not leave the males cold, but they always acted the same way as the females.
Female cats can recognize the degree of excitement of cat babies on the miue of the little ones.
They respond 10 percent faster to sounds from kittens who think they are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and Medical University Hannover (MHH) have found.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the miauing of less and strongly excited young animals are either not noticeable or not relevant to the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology" on Friday.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and tone of the kitten screams differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from MHH livestock were observed.
On the one hand, they were played up calls from little ones who were taken out of the box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams from more excited kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their findings meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who did not have their own offspring, reacted differentiatedly to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the loudspeaker faster when the calls of the very excited kittens were played.
This ability may be congenital or develop with gender maturity.
“One surprise was that the males reacted at all,” the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noise several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski hits Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a warrant has been issued against former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul for the Super Cup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is popular.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempted collapse in July, the government warned that the daily lives of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
It is not stopped before football, either.
The prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant against former Starkicker Hakan Sükür.
According to the report, Sukkur, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be supporter of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, in fact it has almost no impact on the lives of most Turks.
On Wednesday, Erdogan declared the nightly “democracy watch” in public places across the country ended.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Labour Club Besiktas traditionally are not among the friends of the president.
But what the majority of Turks unites in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree, whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At the cup winner "Gala" it will come back especially to Lukas Podolski.
The Cologneman demonstrated his sporting value in the last season: with 17 goals and nine presentations in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season found a conciliatory conclusion for the record champion.
After winning the Champions League, the "Lions" also retired early in the Europa League.
In the Süper League, it only reached sixth place.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win.
“We did that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Besiktas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the base for the 14th title with 26 seasonal goals as Super League Goalkeeper King.
That’s also why the fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old’s return.
Gomez, contracted by AC Florence and only borrowed to Besiktas after the coup attempt, had announced that he would not return after his EM vacation because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the magazine "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman quoted.
But the attacker would have to be willing to give up about a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite doping, these athletes still have medal chances at the Olympics in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping remains the headlines of the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimova, who sued her right to start shortly before the games after a doping blockade, was mercilessly picked up and busted at her start (100 meters breast).
A strange scenery was offered: with a laid-up smile she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When she realized she was not going to get gold, the audience broke out into a jubilant storm.
However, there are many other athletes who are starting at the Rio Olympics despite their doping past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has already been suspended twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion runs even faster than before, he is number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit a six-month block in 2010 after she was proven to take the painkiller oxycodon.
She had severe tooth pain after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic winner of 2012, the World Champion of 2013 and the European Champion of 2010 to 2016 was positively tested for the prohibited stimulant medium methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the deliberate intake and was suspended for six months.
The four largest shot this year will go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 m/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, was positively tested in 2010 and 21 months suspended.
One means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt said.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammer Throw, Belarus): Unfortunately, hardly any athlete has won so many medals afterwards.
Thus, Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after testosterone doping was detected.
The now 40-year-old also had to give Olympic silver 2004 for steroid doping and the 2006 EM title for testosterone abuse.
He also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment of the International Sports Court CAS.
At 80.04 m he ranks second in the world ranking.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world recorder and gold favorite was tested positively in May but still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of taking a forbidden dietary supplement, and the World Anti-Doping Agency’s barrier WADA fell out mildly and expired as early as July 13.
Terrorism in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday early.
She suffered cut wounds and was treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave it.
She planned to return home at the beginning of September.
Whether Austrian citizens are also affected by the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon is still unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities in this regard, Schnöll said.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, initially exploded two bombs Thursday evening in an outdoor area.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people injured, including the Austrian woman, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosives were raised again, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach of Patong, which is popular among tourists.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a city employee.
According to the authorities, the explosive was airborne in a flowerbed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast caused several injuries.
It is a link to the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
“We assume this is a coordinated attack.”
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably about the acts of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern that is typical of the bombings by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not linked to the Islamist uprising movement or international terrorism.
“This is only local sabotage, limited to limited territories and provinces,” a spokesman in Bangkok said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received intelligence reports of upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but they have not been informed about the exact time and locations.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officials across the country to increase security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace that has been used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of Thai security agencies.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
Following conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations, it is advised to avoid unnecessary travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This also gives the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos as the country moves towards stability, economic improvement and tourism.
The military unta, which seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody riots, holds itself to the benefit of having brought the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to control the uprising of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people were killed in the conflict.
Moreover, nearly a year ago in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu sanctuary, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several state offices, the constitutional prosecutors in the Confederation have also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' evidence of aspirations against the free democratic basic order," said Chief of Constitutional Protection Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamated in an extremist way.
That is why we are now watching the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a grouping with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against “multiculti-fiancing”, “uncontrolled mass immigration” and “the loss of one’s own identity through alienation.”
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already watching the "identitaries".
Maaßen said his authority had closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target group where they are," the head of Constitution said.
In general, extremists are trying to address them with a youthful language, often with poppy music.
This is what Islamists and right-wing extremists do.
This is not an advertising for your own business.
Propaganda is to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the “Identitarians” with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge about it.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at some point.
It depends on whether the respective party – in this case the AfD – changes its target direction by certain extremists and becomes so extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the sharp increase in legally motivated crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelter, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there may be right-wing structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler group.
There may be other right-wing terrorist groups or micro groups that are planning attacks against asylum-seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a German-wide or European-wide governance of legal terrorism is not visible.
The previous groups have emerged at the regional level or on social networks.
Concerned, Maaßen expressed concern over the fact that many assaults were carried out on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects of attacks on asylum shelter were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or right-wing supporters.
“Many people have committed crimes that had nothing to mind with right-wing extremists before, perhaps politically indifferent or, for example, have voted for CDU, SPD or the left, but then radicalized by extreme right-wing mood.”
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
Not always the Olympics or world records determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This is evidenced by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia was swimming so slowly that he was sometimes no longer seen in TV pictures.
It simply disappeared – no matter how far the neckline was selected.
On social networks, Habete became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a 48-second lag and took 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not just sporty character that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special starting law from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more known.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte gets ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media referred to him as the “whale roller”.
Based on a "Wellness Stomach", the English bulletin "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, only with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100-meter freestyle, didn’t matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani's race attracted media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete alone in a 100-meter freestyle run.
At that time, Moussambani was frenically encouraged.
The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never done such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop at Neuer Platz has been stolen.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsried had left her shop at around 5.30 p.m. on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning around 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
Video surveillance is also not available.
Trump doesn’t see the threat of election defeat so tight
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election event in Florida.
If it becomes nothing with the election of the U.S. president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
Then he goes on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the U.S. presidential elections in November, he wouldn't care about it: "Ultimately it will either work out, or I'm having a very, very nice, long vacation," the Republican's candidate said in a telephone interview with U.S. TV station CNBC.
If it doesn’t end up being rich for him because of political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
He described President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters trade in electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently great.
The Post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
The company will soon start trading with the transporter.
The Post aims to offer its electric transporters also on the free car market from next year.
“We want to get into sales to third parties,” a post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether it is intended to sell its own-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages, to other companies.
Post-Board Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were repeated demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group will soon enter mass production of the vehicles.
In its own manufacturing, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year per shift.
Gerdes had announced that the group wants to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and peile a complete transition to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
“We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.

GfK Leadership Disappears After Disappointing Business Numbers
Consumer research company GfK exchanges its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes the more uncertain the longer the successes he promised.
Turbulence at the forefront of Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world’s number five industry faces a new staffing start.
GfK CEO plans to leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, will withdraw from the Supervisory Board from 12 September.
The management of the board of directors took over as of 1 September the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company announced.
He is officially supposed to take on the role of a "board spokesman" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company cited "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesperson did not want to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
Investor circles said on Friday that the shareholders were finally disappointed with the still lacking successes of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years," it said.
Given the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will become restless at some point.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do that," he said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss drive even in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarter.
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the previous quarter.
Regarding the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent at EUR 721.2 million.
Earnings in the second quarter have affected the company’s declining value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The depreciation of 139 million euros in the Consumer Experience business unit resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had yet to generate a Group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhorn in Graben: Eight injured
In an accident of a coach with 43 senior passengers, eight people were injured in Krummhorn (Aurich district) on Thursday.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
According to her reports, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid meeting a coming truck, which was partly driving on the counter-track.
The bus dropped right from the road and slipped into a trench, a police spokeswoman reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, people were unable to leave the bus on their own," she said.
Firefighters released the inmates.
Six ambulances and an emergency medical vehicle arrived at the accident site on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travelers were taken back by a line bus to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meter of wastewater from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wastewater system Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl are 3.44 Euros instead of 2.10 Euros to date; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euros (hitherto 2.26 Euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euros (hitherto 2.18 Euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an overwhelming calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the household by the Land Council Office Kulmbach found that undercovery exists for these wastewater systems.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants on the basis of legal grounds.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens, as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to grab deeper into their wallets.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As the management manager Herbert Schmidt showed to the panel, a recalculation of the fees for the municipality’s wastewater systems was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovery from the previous calculation period should also be offset.
The serious fee increases caused Schmidt to consider that all three wastewater systems are relatively small facilities with a very low wastewater accident, which ranges from 6,800 to 12,000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, wastewater inflows in all three plants are slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, all three plants had substantial costs of renovation and repair, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the wastewater system Azendorf due to damage.
At the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from scratch and at the Lopp pond cleaning plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be excavated, the sewage sludge disposed and an additional ventilation facility was installed in order to continue to comply with the water law requirements.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses came the continuing care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculations in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of the low sewage accident in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "pervade fully".
In addition, Schmidt added, the market community has been spared large entertainment costs in the wastewater systems over the past 20 years.
In the opinion of stone houses, the situation for the abovementioned facilities will remain precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the wastewater association Friesenbachtal cannot be expanded by these facilities because they are deficit facilities.
Bulgaria accounts for inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%, as measured by the CPI.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
In July 2016, there was a price increase compared to the previous month in the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transportation (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as an Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already bounds to absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be made from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are unbluffed, characteristic twisting tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All mistakes come to the public.
Snapchat filters have raised criticism in the past accusing them of promoting blackface or propagating white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed to some users a filter that gave them slot eyes, false teeth and vaporized cheeks this week, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies indicated a bigger problem that the company has diversity.
The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon by Asians.
But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful stereotypes.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and mildly said unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling wire.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people – who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts – might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters generates an image that is offensive to a user, “so it’s much more difficult for such things to stay unnoticed than it was before,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account asking others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished his essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat mostly unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a HR manager focusing on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said that she would have her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that it’s not OK.”
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, Congress committee notes
Military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigative committee said in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how supervisors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Information, typically nicked off by Centcom high-level commanders, regularly drawed a more positive picture of American anti-terrorism efforts than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and was consistently more positive than the analysis of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when poor analysis is presented to our political leaders,” said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors at Centcom reach the top of the organization.
The ten-page report depicts in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training the Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their preliminary laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIS.
“During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than it is,” the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recovery of Mosul could begin already in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the heads of the Central Command changed intelligence reports to mitigate the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans started the Task Force after they were told that analysts were worried about manipulating reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed findings as the investigations continue.
Further investigations of the Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense are underway.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday, consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
“In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services,” said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democrat in the committee, a member of the House of Representatives.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the release of intelligence reports," damaged morality among analysts and "given excessively little room for diverging opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of the White House’s intervention with Centcom analysts regarding a “specific political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon’s Inspector General, which were initiated after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on Congressional reports while the Inspector General’s investigation was still underway.
But he also stated that “experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense.”
The investigations have retrospective impacts beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of defense ministry members).
However, last year’s allegations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of conflicts more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only foresaw a small occupying force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current Islamic State reporting.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker notes, according to government agencies, that contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the Islamic State-owned refineries would have no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these provisional refineries would have set up to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The US wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with the UK is coming
One day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever doing that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I am not one of the people who remember their gates.
But she knows that: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are on the same level in their group with the British who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win the first and second places.
The first-placed will avoid the strong Dutch women a little longer, leading the other group.
Whatever the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after landing at the last of 12 places at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey club in hands for the first time at the age of three (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the team.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to the better.
“A cultural change, a mental change, and a physical change,” Bam said.
We didn’t have the amount of work in London that we have now.
We have been able to pull the rod completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the towers in the first half of the game with a reversal from the near area.
India had gone into the game without winning in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and pulled the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had to score a goal in each of the previous games so far.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday.
Amidst the rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it’s the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a racing season between competition and pursuit.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is turned from the breast shooter to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s queue talking at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and is a women's swarm with graves, could have been among those well-known names that are sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even fencher.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shadow, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.
But if I can modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it debuted in Sydney, it has been perceived so scarcely for the past 16 years that many of the people I had interviewed did not know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 that managed to reach the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially combine it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means just as much as "spring board."
Aspiring winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to almost 30 feet in the air, and have to have a series of falling movements (turning, throwing, and jumping) before landing on their feet.
They will be rated according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight.
Medal hopefuls have to go on in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They are chasing not only the finish line or the starting wall, but in television broadcasting also another ridiculous goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a spectator to tears.
But it’s also what I feel a bit tired of watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breath pause.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A move forward is not the goal.
He or she crashes off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
Amidst the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.
If consciousness can only be achieved through the advocacy and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turners suggested recently, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is waiting for his airy, new fan group.
"One Generation Protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia encountered violent government resistance.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during shooting changes.
Is Ethiopia going to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and expanded to more and more territories.
Last week, thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political change.
The government’s response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.
Videos circulating about the protests, which are likely from last or early this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now calls for an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, are receiving so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy expanded at a significant pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led government oppression - opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vast areas of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
All the youth protested.
One generation protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to the grip on the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this sharp, controversial line took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogad National Liberation Front, which have been more or less overcome in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of cooking under the surface.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter doing on a regular basis, especially during protests, many people can still communicate about internet proxies hiding where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For ages, the Amharas, mostly from Ethiopia’s Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and business, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in flatlands.
But this is also changing right now.
"We're about to coordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which make up about 6 percent of the population and dominates in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was especially skilled in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special representatives to deal with opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this fundamental skill," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many worry that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, seemed to have been plundered by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though they were fewer than in recent months and this period of riots passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new trail, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government’s internal dissatisfaction.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked businesses run by Tigray in Gondar, an Amharian town, and hate for the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin hike."
Donald Trump declares his claim that Obama founded ISIS as "Sarkasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, claiming that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group was not meant seriously.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his fellow fighters, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he might not have meant at all.
After making the indication at an election event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump backed on Thursday’s claim and insisted in interviews that he really didn’t intend to hint that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump weaken the statement a bit by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The latest storm of criticism shook down on Mr. Trump as he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals for higher taxes would lead and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already put forward sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but later declared, “Of course I meant that sarcastic.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rowing back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clear" according to what the reaction is going on," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of damaging the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even worse tone as his poll values have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist published Friday showed a leading leadership in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.
But while he is increasingly focused on the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have brought his loyal fellows into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made a great deal of effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Giuliani said, "so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."
It is true in that sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbanker, completely wrong and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the administration under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by refrain from aggressively controlling the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of the Pennsylvania campaign events on Friday, Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" television experts trying to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.
Once displaced from the market above price, cafe in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a rude cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay for cash, which did not have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prizes were removed from his Bedford Avenue shop front.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a town that is being honored.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, “I know New York is change, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and the verb is now a soap business.”
But if New York is change, then it’s also reinventing.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, who owns and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working with Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment, too.
He introduced new ingredients.
There are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are garnishings such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, once lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the coffee and culture that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a Blended Chai Tea that day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably always ordered the same thing.
"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my everything-bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything-bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no resentment for the soap business taking over the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
“I think we will still respond to their offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the cafe.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee in bottles.
There is a chance that the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular client and said he was destroyed on the ground when the cafe closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The Depressing Eating of the Economic Crisis in “an Abundant Meal”
In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt had a weakness for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert a plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book "Chop Suey" dealt with Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Brickman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Their latest collaboration, “A Decent Meal,” which will appear at Harper Publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when meeting with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, seamless snack in Flatiron District that has been in business since the 1929 stock market crash.
Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, the couple found this suitable for a discussion about eating in the Great Depression era.
"Wealthy foods were very popular," Brickman said.
There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinners.
Coe smile.
"It must have laid in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastries were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" outlines the ways that the country was dealing with not being the slaraffland anymore.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans,” Coe said, “Why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and cash rolls became basic foods, the cash roll as "a wonderful way to recycle food residues," noted Brickman, as chefs could hide unappeased ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures have been tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen understanding.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunch," Coe says.
Brickman continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or ever since, household economists – including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 – pushed the country’s eating habits so much.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become “housekeepers” and meet the challenge of turning pamphlet like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicious food.
In particular, the reports of the government's response to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-cake-essen-standing, are tasty.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed like the million-weight man of the world he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a smoking.
He was a wonderful stranger to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, Ms. Roosevelt’s hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most uncomfortable prepared.
Many of the species from the Great Depression era dealing with food were discarded as soon as the country came back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, Brickman said, as well as how science was applied to food.
The couple explained when writing the book that they had better understood the eating habits of Brickman’s mother-in-law—for example, how she couldn’t throw away food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Brickman remembered, "She really made people sick."
There was the windpocket incident.
After the plates were cleaned at Eisenberg's, they and Coe made a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Brickman said, adding that it was a common trick to miss out on modest recipes with a chic name.
There was no beaten cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone dipped somewhat reluctantly a spoon in the tough, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe picked up a repeat three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A couple of chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bombing: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
The 30-year-old also died in a barrel bombing attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that has so far saved nearly 60,000 lives, according to Bild newspaper.
2,900 volunteers are putting their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the group’s face: a video of the civilian defender showing him in an 11-hour rescue of a infant from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a bright symbolic figure in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, according to the picture, "For me, this is the true jihad."
“When I die to save lives, I think God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopter dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one of which was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from breathing shortages.
“We are now eliminating the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don’t play with it,” the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime’s deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland Shark: The Oldest Vertebrate is Almost 400 Years Old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims through the North Atlantic with a speed of 1 km/h - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at the age of 150.
Slowly the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal at this maximum speed.
However, this slow-moving lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.
"Madness," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrate animals.
Evolutionary biologists have long suspected that Greenland sharks are being stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live primarily in the sea of the ice off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of about six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow pace as they equiped six animals with a broadcaster in front of Spitzbergen.
Nevertheless, these sharks do prey: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol the bottom of the ice sea and look for corpses that twist down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen took from the depths of the North Atlantic from Greenland between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest measured 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens cores of the sharks using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created before sharks are born, and the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts threw large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the 3rd smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th anniversary during its investigation in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-breaking 502-centimeter shark is likely to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females would only have offspring when they were more than four meters longer.
Now, the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of gender maturity and his age was determined at the age of 156, Greenland sharks can obviously be reproduced for at least one and a half centuries.
This is likely to be a world record for vertebrate animals.
The fact that such methusalems live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon was a 120-year-old harpoon tip on the neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a sparing flame.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is much greater than of an elephant.
Another advantage is that you have fewer enemies.
“A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible,” explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building ground in double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on topics related to building.
With relief, the panel adopted Mayor Robert Putz’s notice that “the marketing of recently designated residential areas can finally begin.”
After the land, parcellation and development issues have been resolved and the applications for measurement have been submitted, the sale of the land in the residential building areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - expansion section 1) is no longer in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schönau appeal to young families and armed seniors alike.
Construction volunteers are said to be able to contact the town hall from now on, the municipal council is expected to be advised on the award of the plots at its September meeting.
In order to be able to satisfy requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises, associated with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the new land use plan in sub-areas only prepared in the spring of this year.
Thus, the commercial area already identified there is expanded by two plots towards state road 2112 in the sub-period area of Larn.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city has the best chances to attract jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote,” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW’s financial and real estate markets field of competence.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate financial transactions across the EU from London.
For the so-called EU pass, it is sufficient for them to be admitted in the UK.
This is what big U.S. banks are using.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which unites responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Board EIOPA and the ESRB.
Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important to the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervisors,” says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large sector of funds, but, like Dublin, it is worse in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Also points the city with easily available commercial properties.
“In Paris, it’s not that easy to find free high-quality offices,” says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than its competitors thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking by Mercer, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg ranks 19th, Dublin ranks 33rd and Paris ranks 37th.
Even though quality of life is a matter of preferences: “With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors,” the IW concludes.
But London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Brexit voting, the economic researchers say.
In London, according to data from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people in the banking industry worked at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt there were 62,500 people.
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. official judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimburse the legal costs incurred by the Hepatitis C litigation with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempt from a $200 million damages payment for Merck’s violation of two patents related to Gilead’s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on Merck’s part, including false oath and other unethical acts.
U.S. Judge Beth Labson Freeman said on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to dismiss the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to equal Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property for laboratory work underlying Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have recovered full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters left the town, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
The Democratic Forces of Syria (DKS) are currently combing through the city after the exit of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city.
They have released over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
“The city is now under full control, but we are currently doing cleanup work,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her tax return for 2015 on Friday, giving the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband an income of $10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in redemption; the former Foreign Minister income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her term in the Department of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton’s Vice-Presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, is publishing his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a sharp opposition to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdrawals in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"They're on the train," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, in relation to the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before tax audits are completed.
Trump’s critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it apparent that his refusal raises questions regarding wealth, his donations to charities, his business conduct and various other ties, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already stumbled on the topic and posted a video on the Internet on Friday calling on high-ranking Republicans to publish Trump’s tax return.
On Thursday she also spoke about the issue during a speech on economics in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the past few decades and to publish his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico reported that during the 1990s Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years, and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors on Friday, stating that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is headquartered here, called for Trump to meet at a meeting to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump had “fear” in front of voters and not in front of tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has issued tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax return showed that they only earned $100 of their income as pay, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton’s dividends and income were taxed at $109,000.

Condoms with Chili Powder, Fireworks Promote Tanzania's Elephant Protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to human-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, together with U.S. natural protection, has intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their homes and harvest without injuring animals.
Before that, many spears used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
“Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to see a change in their attitudes within these communities, with they being much more confident that they can keep elephants off their fields without harming the elephants,” Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If it is not discouraged, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with soil is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, whose end is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is ignited, the condom bursts with a bump and sprays fine dust with chili powder into the air.
A fair touch usually already out to chase the elephant.
Another possibility is a thrower to fire a gold rain firework in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on the St. Goar Rhine bank
Usually, the St. Goar investment projects are accepted by traders with kisshand - especially the retail in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the city council now unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the bank of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this site in an exposed location on the bank of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU group.
Jewish director breaks down Berlin hotel because Israeli code code has been removed after "Arabic" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli phone number as Arab guests “requested” according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah" released his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country code list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to select Israel through its own call center.
After seeking an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was "a deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the code be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a “great shame,” the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were shocked and dismayed by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a greater shame.
There is no explanation for this.
We expect the hotel "to draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked a fairly large resonance on the internet, in which people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some assumed the Kempinski Hotel that it had "responded" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame you," it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations, calling the incident an "accident" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, reports The Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order to not include Israel on the quick election list," a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel quoted the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police deploy tear gas and rubber guns against protesting Brazilian students
Students gathered with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday to demonstrate against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber guns against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to break the students apart, which led to the police using rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay over the plans.
According to the proposals of Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin, slightly fewer than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw Graffitits spray on walls against provisional President Michel Temer.
The recent protests occurred a few days after mass protesters went out to the streets to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who was removed from office by a Senate vote for her withdrawal.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade sales between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent annually.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in businesses in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are starting existing connections with Iran, while new companies are willing to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran rose by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
Trade recovery was achieved through deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year are being broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have kept monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched: beverage market raided in Waldbröl
A robbery was carried out on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Three dark-dressed persons who had mummified their faces demanded cash from the beverage market employees and then fled on foot first and then presumably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money was stolen, the police did not tell.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the park deck of the Rewe market and is poorly visible.
After the raid, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and have fled from the gravel parking lot located opposite the parking entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly towards B 256 (Schladerring).
Those who have made observations in connection with the robbery at the time of the crime (about 7:45 p.m.) should urgently contact the police.
Nagold: Play and fun at summer break
Eight beautiful and happy days the children and youth of the social educational group/social group work of the children’s protection federation Nagold spent with their caregivers on their summer break in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located recreational home Hardtwäldle, the life-joying group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day excursions were on the agenda.
On the one hand, it went to Bretten with the visit of the joking zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children’s guided tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed at Lake Tiefen in Maulbronn, inviting them to jump, swim and plank.
In culinary terms, children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared body foods such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful pieces of jewelry were created from pearls and stones, or a Roman mill game was made from wood.
Other highlights of leisure included fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bunte Evening".
On the day of return, the sun laughed and the children and youths returned satisfied home.
Haigerhole: Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Rome pilgrimage of all ministers in expected two years, the Round of Ministers St. Anna has decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally chosen for the Bishops’ City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered with the opened gate of Mercy at Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerhole and Holy Rooms set off.
The evening before, priest Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims’ crosses and gave the pilgrims’ blessings.
From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where a Münster of Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage route was started from Münster.
The individual day tours were framed by a short impulse each morning and evening with different prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the minis repeatedly rested at crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially compiled pilgrim booklet.
For the overnight stays there were parish houses of the local parishes.
At the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day we started the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, as they had to drop around 500 meters of altitude in the hole heat and then be climbed again.
The deserved reward was a common grilling at the bathroom.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visually relieved and happy, the minis arrived at Freiburg Münster in the late afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked.
At the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotte Callum Skinner storms home when British wins gold for cycling
Scotland’s Callum Skinner raced to fame last night in the men’s team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio when the British team defended the 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had taken himself. The boy's pund made the legend proud as he stormed home to win the New Zealand favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth out of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after winning only a modest sixth place at the World Rail Championships in London in March, despite Hoy's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hind.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scottish that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes lay short after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A strategy change made up a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked up from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here just to do my best and make myself a name.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph alongside Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell onto the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the tribune."
We have been together as a team in the last three months.
We got so bad off with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that awaits us successful five days in Velodrom.
With Kenny's shape, it is possible that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny then takes part in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten as a knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-mile race.
They arrived at the target at 3:51,942.
The world record won gold in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will surely be focused.
He had argued with officers yesterday before the qualification when officials called him to measure his body height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team rely on their strong track team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympic Games and win a bunch of medals.
After a truly exceptional depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been lowered.
Dramas were played in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid accusations of sexism and bullying as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, looking at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it seems quite like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
Future of the Portland Melting Plant Due to Revocation of the Energy Agreement
The future of Portland’s aluminum melt in Victoria – as well as hundreds of workers’ jobs – are at stake as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the facility.
A 20-year grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
No less than 2,000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting mill consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Melt Factory, which resulted in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa melthouse in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This step follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally as a result of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum melt plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is expected that three more owners will terminate their contracts.
The facility is majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the facility to continue operating in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity from the melt plant," the company said.
AGL also stated that the contracts are so-called “security transactions” that should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so they will end in 2017.
“AGL therefore expects that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17,” said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL starting at GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already deducted the value of the contracts in its annual financial statement of $187 million in "expected termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts, "Alcoa's ability to operate the melting mill or to ensure power supply to the melting mill" did not affect.
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November of this year, even though there is still a obligation to explain why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the potential closure of the Portland Melt Plant in Victoria and the Tomago Plant near Newcastle due to the industry’s poor economic conditions.
Referring to analysts’ statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago consumes around 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And for us as electricity producers, that would not be good,” he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the sought after September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?) scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn's problem cases, as well as the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forgot the cover of their sister.
This represents the cliché-filled plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "Did you thought we forgot you?", with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcasting venue at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this advertisement.
With regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall’s big sister, Kim, likes to have beaten her regarding the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on seeing in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
For Vogue, the September edition is the best-selling edition of the year.
With a scope that is more similar to an image tape than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, from the 832 pages of the roller, 615 pages were advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is expected so eagerly that in the last two years, the magazine’s pictures have sniffed through before its official announcement.
Women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more “models that are famous” than “models that are famous” on the cover.
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored.
But even with the low chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to shoot a good snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner’s success doesn’t like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been a bit tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.
But riding around the disgust seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
In the true sense of the word, she is a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises your foundation by Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell pictures of yourself to you on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Community Law Centres Dismiss 160,000 People Every Year
More than 160,000 of the country’s needy are rejected annually by community law centres, while the industry is preparing for the impact of further funding cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly, immigrants, poor workers, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unfair relocations and the like – are already being rejected when they request free legal advice and legal counsel.
Legal services from the municipality, which are already excessively burdened, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
Queesland’s director of community law centers, James Farrell, said the latest survey by the National Association of community law centers revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected each year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without repealing the federal government’s decision.
"Queensland community law centers are chronicly underfunded, which means that thousands of people will be rejected from important services you need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through separations, workers who have been unjustly dismissed – all of these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funds by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Minister of Justice and Queensland Senators George Brandis to quickly lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need for legal issues.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centers and their customer communities, as well as that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump Election Campaign Accused After Employees Allegedly Withdraw Weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her North Carolina campaign leader targeted a gun at an employee while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in the Charlotte State Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he had waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realized that "that would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "pulled a gun, put his right-handed finger on the pull-out, and struck the run in Vincent's knee throat," Bordini stated in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini noted that at least four others had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
“Weapons don’t have to be fired to do damage,” Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and gun friends - should take action in case his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and appointed judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had pulled his words out of the context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for personal injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump’s press spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, was not reached for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip were equally unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news station in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not answered.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far conducted a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg, Charlotte.
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This was found by representative surveys by the INSA for the "Bild"-Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could rule slightly further in the north, this is not possible according to the polls in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances of continuing to be the leader.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to a survey, the party was just ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would reach 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.
Despite slight losses, the Greens are returning to the Landtag of Schwerin with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3% each.
In the Berlin House of Representatives election, according to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives with 14 percent for the first time.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, while the pirates would miss the move, unlike in 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet slowly: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn’t in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was pretty clod.
The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which today would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into store exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come back somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish cell phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hannover as a “western pocket office”.
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for the standards of the time: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax the communicator was to be reached.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, although tormentingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be unfolded like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-mark, that is, about 1400 euros.
The average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The Finnish cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.
The market now dominates vendors, who all came much later than Nokia.
Being online everywhere is everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold, with Samsung and Apple alone accounting for 555 million units.
Global sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, the businesses of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies are well running.
In the meantime, a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough in the mass market came only in early 2007, at the time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, all easily operated by touch screen.
Apple’s victory started, the iPhone is still the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola, and BlackBerry, who dominated the market, did not look at it.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian providers like Samsung are now leading.
The smartphone is a natural thing 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for staffing in the Siemens board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just like in London in 2012, when we made a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new teaching positions, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think the challenge of Heathrow’s enlargement is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he has asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion in witness growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented an expensive infrastructure investment program of <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion in time and budget, from the T5 - which was voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to the T2, which was built amidst the two most frequented runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, supported by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion in private investment.
The London Games of 2012 were a huge success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies earning money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game."
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus released a blog post telling users that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements to make ad blocks more difficult to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of hin-and-her battle between the ad blocking open source community and the surroundings is already underway since the invention of ad blockers,” and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has become involved in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s social network and Instagram mobile app, a spokesman said.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes up a large enough share of revenue, so Facebook’s investment in such a step seems worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over targeted advertising on them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
“For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem,” a Facebook spokesman said in an email message.
Ad blockers are a stubborn medium, which is why we have focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences instead to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman struck in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police call witnesses after a woman was struck in the early hours of Thursday morning in a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the road in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, police in Vaud said.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was overtaken by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She still died on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, asking them and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen if one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision preventable?
That’s something the prosecutor has to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian would run on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper named.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligent killing after she struck and killed a man who lay one night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified way and that a man's presence on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere, could have once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still slowly continued to rotate.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
“In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the sun for almost two months,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which looks like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus that resembles the evolution previously suspected by planet researchers.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as Colorado Avalanche’s coach and vice president of hockey operations, leading to too little participation in the team’s decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorado’s Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
“Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Colorado’s Avalanche Hockey Operations with energy, passion and certainty,” Roy said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking over the course of the summer for a long time and a lot about how to improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization.
He must also have the right to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
During his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches, Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach in the league.
He led the club to 112 points and first in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Minnesota Playoffs and missed the offseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches scored a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start talks again, stop strike
Labour struggles regarding pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all parties are sitting on the table for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted sporadicly on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT trade unions, can confirm that we have agreed to re-start the process of settlement of the current dispute,” the company said in a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day sessions in the coming weeks, which will begin early next year to tackle the problems again.
The unions said their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut rates on its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts give the company the space needed to get through the market decline.
Shell has fired thousands of people for its part and announced plans to quit its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had aggravated by the decision of the British to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish parliamentarians Dave Anderson met with labour leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in expenditure on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Pleiads
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotational rates under the stars of the Pleiadian cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotation periods are related to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our findings with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between a star’s mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The star cluster of the Pleiads is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which emerged about 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
You're turning fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these ripening stars emit large amounts of star winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot — such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning slowly than smaller ones.
“In the ballet of the Plejadians, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars,” Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of the Pleiads is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star cluster of the Pleiads provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about, how how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes" so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiads, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star leaves
The tears of Alex Rodriguez ran faster than the US baseball star in the best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement on August 12, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees against the Tampa Bay Rays for the last time.
“I love this game and this team.”
"I'm saying goodbye to both," said the 14-time Major League Baseball (MLB) all-star player.
Rodriguez was elected the league's most valuable player three times, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signing under a ten-year contract has provided him with $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid back with performance for a long time.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994–2000), the Texas Rangers (2001–2004) and the Yankees since 2005, he achieved some milestones.
With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is not expected to be admitted to the baseball’s fame hall.
Because so successfully Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the field.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN" having taken steroids banned between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 parties due to a involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal until the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect of having received performance-promoting funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the blockade was reduced to 162 encounters.
“The league could have even done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without a break,” Rodriguez said.
Even his goodbye days do not go silent.
While many baseball legends once again got the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
“My job involves trying to win every game,” Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and the relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson is claimed to have received sympathy from fans of Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang in the 4:9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3,000-meter runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski have been tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the critically watched athletics competitions, these news come to the moment.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, was already demonstrated last Sunday.
The International Sports Court CAS on Friday afternoon confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the final over 100 meters butterfly, with only 0.09 seconds missing the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the preliminaries over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to open the B sample and have a hearing.
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive trial at Danekova passed through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive herself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive,” she told BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete said.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova has been temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample is said to have already been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately spoke with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said: "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone, like his brother Tomasz three days earlier.
Both deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, especially the Danekova case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF had banned the launch of the entire Russian crew, except for a systematic doping exception, and Kenya’s runner-up produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the former offences in China also caused heavy disputes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic winner Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pissed purple."
"When I see the 200m freestyle podium, I want to surrender," Lacourt told the French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a confrontation with Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping fraudsters,” he said.
Sun had been tested positively for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to sit a three-month lock.
How perfide hackers blackmail their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted at companies – and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of an attack with extortion software over the past twelve months at least once, in some cases multiple times.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already targets of ransomware extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom money demanded by the perpetrators to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The perpetrators specialize their extortion software according to the observations of Malwarebytes increasingly on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the ransom to be potentially blackmailed is much higher than it is for private users.
"We are currently observing a terrifyingly rapid evolution of malware," said Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes, in a conversation with the "Welt".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send ads.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
Initially, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks has been terrifyingly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where private users have a personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is stopped.
Consequently, the damage is higher when a ransomware hits.
22 percent of German companies reported losses in revenue due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely discontinue business, in one case people were at risk of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
“We always say to the victims: don’t pay, they only promote the problem,” explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators’ demand in the face of a downturn in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the extortionists and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to make more money.
They explain to their victims by chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies will partly have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware extortion, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware about within a week.”
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software builder to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
“A customization tool is included so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed,” says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then search for more hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims.
We live in a service industry.
So you log in to one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"The criminals will usually entrust spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that are better securing their data.
More than 50 percent of the company’s IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust in being able to defend ransomware through file backups and scanner software.
Consequently, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“When data encryption alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful erection, the perpetrators are instead threatened with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” said Marcin Kleczynski, CEO of Malwarebytes.
Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is thus many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new targets in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how to get a internet-connected thermostat under their control.
In the middle of winter, the unlocking of such a blocked heater could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block an entire manufacturing line in a factory, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, built on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the back, it doesn’t work tightly anywhere.
The materials in the interior are well processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit upper falls a little.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space.
Not only is a trunk of 453 l available for elevated and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus provide storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height is slightly higher with 650 mm than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
However, he should do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption is 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another engine: a 1.5 l gasoline engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes open in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City emergency brake assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the track holding assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because it rates many obstacles as "coming objects" when ranking.
The far-light assistant works very reliably.
And the smart timing controller responds to traffic sign detection and reduces the speed if necessary.
Full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are underneath the armrest and are therefore somewhat difficult to reach.
The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and day-to-day car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on Passenger Bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For liability is conceivable only in the event of hazards typical of air transport, argued the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a knee disk when he dropped.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere – it is a general life risk, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Disease case: when the organizer pays
Sick holidaymakers only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to have the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, one family was severely ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkish vacation.
She spent almost all the vacation in the room.
Their illness led the holidaymakers to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family believed that the trip was deficient and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in court.
The wastewater treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organiser only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs depart.
He had to assume until then that the seawater was okay.
He did not breach his information obligations, according to the judgment.
Especially since no impurities were found in the water samples.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly due to infection with one another - is a general life risk.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state must react wisely and resolutely to terror threats at the same time.
Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country faster, however, it would increase security and strengthen the public’s approval of refugee policy.
De Maizière aims to achieve implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced another personnel reinforcement of the security forces, "in a medium four-digit order over several years."
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is aimed at improving the weapons law in such a way that it is especially difficult to buy weapons on the internet.
The recently much-debated silence duty for doctors should be observed, according to de Maizière’s words.
However, he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical agency to reduce the danger of citizens, he said, for example, with a view to psychological inconveniences.
In order to counter the radicalization of refugees, the Minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD chief Gabriel said, “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that will help to further increase security.”
It is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly opposed actionism.
"That was a whip for the sharp makers in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
He considers that a general prohibition of full cover-up is problematic under constitutional law.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Chief Simone Peter accused the Minister of wanting to simulate action and ability with ever-new anti-terrorism packages.
Left-wing leader Bernd Riexinger said: “The fleet of sayings and a tightening of the right of residence will no longer bring security to the people of this country.”
Improved traffic flow on the highway
It is regularly stuck on the bypass road - here is a picture of November.
But this should change: the right-wing path should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic traffic on the surrounding road every evening when driving on the highway (A 43).
Landesbetrieb Straßebau extends the right-wing track by 700 meters on next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße departure.
Drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Straße to the right.
The big advantage: traffic is divided earlier, thus improving the overall process on the busy section of Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group represented in the district Münster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder annoys the drivers especially between 5 and 7 p.m.
On workdays, the backstop extends to the bridge across the Albersloher Path and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle hole on the B 51 just before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only directed one-lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt three-quarters of years ago.
The reason: static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb heavy duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this congestion and the associated day-to-day congestion will last cannot be said by the country’s responsible company.
Years are to be expected, however, because the bridge has an official remaining period of use until 2034.
For the extension of the right-wing track, the state company has consciously chosen the weaker traffic time in school holidays, because disabilities are expected.
Traffic will be passed past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The Nima's Association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an award-winning play "The Invisible House" of the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 attended the stage in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers the opportunity to attend schools with welcoming classes cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, including from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, scenic images and video animations, they were nevertheless able to follow the storyline, according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people between 14 and 20 years of age with or without a migratory background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally conducted courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language communication are in planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
Given the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain rather than starfall: Hope of weather improvement
The weather has made the star-shubbing guckers in southwestern Germany a point through the bill in the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited to watching the sky due to clouds and rain, Welzheim Observatory Chairman Hans-Ulrich Keller said Friday morning.
Our hope lies in the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we will surely see a lot of stars sliding in the sky.
The starfish are perseids, which are one of the fastest starfish at 216,000 kilometres per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, in the night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is already long before wake-up calling to no longer think of sleep.
That's all but relaxing.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as unrelaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weess, member of the board of directors of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this is insomnia, which is an insomnia and through-sleep disorder.
It is precisely sleeping that many people feel as unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of directors of the German Hausärzteverband with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also medications.
Not rarely, sleep disorder is the expression of another disease.
“Very early waking up is most common in depression,” says Weess.
And it may be that various factors depend on each other.
For example, a person who has an intervertebral disorder may lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and may begin to talk about everyday problems and concerns, Weess gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to a doctor with sleep disorders?
Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are impaired during the day should go to the doctor, Weess advises.
The impairment can look quite different: you are tired, tired, unsleeping, have difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, have mood fluctuations or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out the causes.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any sleep doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, if you have problems with sleep, you should first contact the family doctor, Weess advises.
They can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens there?
For examination in the sleep lab, doctors advise, for example, snoring with breath failure, sick daytime fatigue, sleep walkers, or when the cause of through-sleep disorder is not found, Fietze explains.
In fact, you don’t have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Please don’t sleep at lunch,” says Fietze.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
Besides the electrodes on the body you wear a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected manage the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjustment screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and waking hours, not lying too long in bed, not sleeping during the day, not watching television to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you start to count immediately, and this is not quite beneficial at all.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken on Facebook about the disappointing outcome of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the first time at the Short-Track World Championships in Doha, while setting his first world record.
Former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has now faced his critical former teammates protectively via Facebook.
“In a country where an Olympic winner gets a €20,000 prize and a jungle king gets €150,000, no one should wonder about missing medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page.
The conveying system in swimming sports is poor, the doping controls, on the other hand, very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look closely at doping, or even do it.
“I’m not saying that checks should be stopped here,” he said.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
The same should be done with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before the World Cup/OS by independent WADA/FINA inspectors must not participate," the electoral Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream dial, demands.
Airport: Band of luggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport
Dusseldorf police civilians succeeded in arresting two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several baggage and baggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9.30 a.m., civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognised a gang known to police officers from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year and had acted jointly, partly at work and especially professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission Office 34 can prove four crimes to the thiefs who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
In total, they robbed more than 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, in the meantime still a rest of stone pavements: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn’t look like that at first glance, but the police rank it as one of the “dangerous places” of the city.
Walking the road from east to west, you can pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and an organic shop.
Someone sprayed to the facade of a gray house "ugly!"
Opposite a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built here.
However, articles about this "trendly neighborhood", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, have been illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
In particular, the Berlin interior senator Henkel had repeatedly since the beginning of the year expressed himself in favour of a harsh action by the police against the project, referring to the area as a "no-go-zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On June 22, after the ground floor rooms, the Kadtersmide, had been cleared with 300 police officers, police patroled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, locked parts of the road and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved out under the rejoicing of sympathizers and local residents.
This summer afternoon, the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk late.
In the immediate vicinity of the home projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana, who raises three children here, are mostly annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the home projects, they share concerns about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a kiez that mostly wanted police protection from the vandalistic left.
The pit opened by the Berlin interior senator and the police between house occupiers and their neighbors apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city today.
House occupations and the residential projects born thereof have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990 numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Riga River.
While the Mainzers had been cleared under a large police order in a real street battle, many of the projects in Riga have been legalized and are still inhabited today by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electoral officials from all over the world: with them now residents of GDR times and former homeowners share their kies.
This is also noticeable in rents, which have increased by nearly 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognised on thrown discs or freshly painted façades that have been thrown with color bags.
No other road was mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence".
One reason that not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as injury are based on statistics aimed almost exclusively at police officers.
Most of the crimes account for property damage, which tends to hit new buildings and newly renovated homes.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there is no talk of uncertainty.
When it comes to acts of violence, it is calming: the people in the 94's are their neighbors, they certainly weren't.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed directly in Riga for a long time.
For the studying architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neubauer deliberately moved into Riga Street - and remained.
That’s why it was so important for her to get her streets back: from the police, the politics and the media, who all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the neighborhood in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building gaps that displace the old inhabitants.
"These are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting to many here - there are more people who don't live so well," she says.
"I can't absolutely endorse violence and destruction."
But what do you do if nobody ever listens?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for attracted people who are annoyed about colour bombs: the home projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who moves here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain about noise there.
All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their real name
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.
The social educator supports the administration team of Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact for all stakeholders: refugees, refugee aid work group, administration, authorities and others.
Regine Kunde from the Working Group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-legging wool milk that has a problem above all.
For example, some - less mockery than targeting the many desired tasks - had meant when the administration wanted to sign up for the job.
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought precisely an egg-legging wool milch.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
It is primarily about organization, working with the people on the ground and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.
“It’s high time,” says Regine Kunde, “that Annika Deuschle supports honourable and permanent actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
New containers are coming soon in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been for some time finding homes for refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must house the refugees in their own or rented homes.
The costs of the construction, rental or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the Land Council Office to the Municipality and Job Center.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer their apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find any private homes.
It does not work so far, relying on private apartments, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, communal housing needs to be maintained, as it is called so beautiful.
Soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But it is not done with apartments alone.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed residence, internship places, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
“More places would be good,” says Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help housekeepers, do non-profit work - and that motivated and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will have a positive external effect.
This is “no employment therapy.”
Activity does not mean only work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So administration and volunteers also jump here.
It is central that refugees feel like they are welcome and desirable in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language classes.
Whoever at some point develops the feeling that he can’t help anyone in Urbach, shouldn’t work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also cases of problems, the customer honestly says, "people with nothing at all". Therefore, the work of Deuschle and the customer is always to motivate others.
All of this is a “mamma task.”
A difficult question: Are they both afraid of radicalization after the recent incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde, "what some may call naive," but a residual risk can and does not want to exclude it.
The helpers are aware.
These incidents are also an issue for refugees.
They would be afraid that the killers would completely disdain them.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, major and volunteers must look for activities on site and in the region.
They always have in the background that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics are afraid.
Actually, it is unfair to put them on the ground.
“In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we wanted to go,” says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine’s customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers have already been burdened by reasonably integrating the previous people.
There are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they need to be helped, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated that there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Thieves with helicopters searched
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men forcedly invaded an apartment in a multi-family house on the Lindenweg on Friday morning around 8:50 a.m.
The inhabitant surprised the two and escaped the unhold.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wore blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled to downtown.
For the search, the police deployed several strip crews and a police helicopter.
The search went unsuccessfully.
Perhaps the unknowns fell to the nearby home or when they fled.
