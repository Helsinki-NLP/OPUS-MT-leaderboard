Republican strategy to counter Obama’s re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
The Brennan Centre considers the latter a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Republican lawyers have reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the U.S. democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the U.S.
It was in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws from 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon grew wide after the November 2010 elections, which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce pre-voting periods, invalidate the right to register as voters on the day of the poll and withdraw citizens with a judicial file their right to vote.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to place such a demand.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have been sponsoring bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such an identity card.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID card.
Much more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
Two out of three Hispanic voters are in favour of the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on the day of the poll in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to recording about 10 million citizens.
However, measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the rate of enrollment of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states to reduce the pre-voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same was the case with Hispanic people.
These represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the Democratic governors’ vetos.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed legislation requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules in place will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the supportiveness of the laws that have been voted and see it as an obvious goal to influence results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will in part undermine the U.S. democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: passing the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes show erroneous results, with false negative or even false positive results, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant.
Passing the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination among the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have strong recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that you are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if you are not screened.
So I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once we have detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
The patient must really understand the degree of risk of his or her cancer, by offering him or her possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not impair long-term life, and instead opting, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who detect cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest that they do active monitoring and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria are being precisely determined to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend passing the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite research progress, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone eat well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of all cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
It hurts people’s health a lot.
“Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CCS.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
“Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” it added.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much amount, it increases the risk of having colorectal cancer.
Carbohydrates, too, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it is explained.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them saw a decreased risk of prostate cancer, another rather saw an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Pasing a screening test doesn't give cancer."
Higgs's Boson Shedding
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole emotion last summer, and for reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely sure that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it resembles much the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data unveiled this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but there is still lack of data to be absolutely certain.
Anyway, let's assume it's the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem small, and let's see what it's about.
There is, in this lower world, a fatally indispensable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting largely of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens named Fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, we must emphasize here, are not all as exotic beasts as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
When, indeed, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at this specific location, a bit like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" arises an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, somewhat as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes an immense particle accelerator like that of CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27-kilometre ring! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is not all particles or materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, yours) do not have a mass.
Now, what can "bring" all this research, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and this also allows physicists to examine any gap between the observations and predictions of the MS.
Moreover, there are many who want to be found, because any difference could open a door to a "new physics" and close some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oups!).
But we haven’t found such differences at CERN until now.
Impacts
The repercussions of these researches in the daily life of Mr. and Madame Tout-le-Monde are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of laser in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - initially the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his optical work.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original intention, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this doesn’t mean that LHC’s activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, really, you never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... <0x7C> The Duty
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a bill is being prepared.
In this critical area, much remains to be done.
The Duty tried to take a closer look at it.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that swallowed him had left him a two-year rest.
"They gave me five years to live, I was seven years old," he said, lying in his bed at the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease does its work: an enormous weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Attacked in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself eat help, resigned.
Courageous, he even gets to smile, talks to strangers who take care of him, bring his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I should be healed from diarrhea, it's humiliating," he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
“During our lives, we learn that a man pisses standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Regressing to the child's stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he notes.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and suffocated."
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I no longer have any wishes in life,” she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the coming days, she is waiting for a last visit from her son who came from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provide body care and food assistance.
These are palliative care, given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that you all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the house’s doctors.
Whether it’s physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying, we will accept to provide mouth care to the brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died overnight.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but don’t look the same.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family assembly in the courtyard, well stuck in his pillows while he is drinking in his honour, a 36-year-old young man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
“For six months, there have always been three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their homes, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77 per cent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Grand Montréal Palliative Home Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that causes several palliative care doctors to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care committees including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is agreed.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days at the emergency, in great pain, without doing the necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid that patients are only asking to die because they don't get adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are stuck with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Helen Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she gave up harsh chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting.
Yet she told me I was over!
Not Almighty Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not acceding to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society of Palliative Home Care of Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which means to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend to not hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Those who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanasia me,” that means “I want to be relieved.”
This reporting was made possible through a journalism scholarship from the Institutes of Health Research of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers from political parties and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know of a formidable "system", mixing building industry, officials, politicians, unionists and mafioso.
A "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has collapsed since we took the great means," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into malversations related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which then Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only consented to go back.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and official corruption.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Transportation Ministry alone would have saved $1 billion on contracts,” he said, “some have stopped their instincts to get a quota.”
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will "demonstrate the schemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also involved with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
More the police of the Hammer squad, who, since 2009, allegedly led the Montreal "sewage cartel" to put the soft pedal on contract swellings...
In recent weeks, she has conducted serial searches and charges for fraud and corruption against local elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally charged with Montreal road engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years he himself paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who returned the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed at all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, mainly the Liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts which he inflated the costs of
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working roundly.
Gilles Surprising, a former public works engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received gift construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials admitted that they greased their legs by bulking bills by 30% to 40%, with fake extras.
Then an organizer of the Mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cashiers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected women in Montreal to ring the alarm.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she insued as early as 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought for $5 million and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in full real estate boom.
70% Dirty Money in Election Campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "draws on a thread to understand how the system works, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the wrongdoers."
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We are cleaning up the wound, but it would take a Montreal-owned investigation unit and a standby, so as not to see the doubtful practices return.
Like we do cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elects aware of the scheme", when they were not soaking in the mud!
Estimating 70% of the share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not change, he said: "Until election spending is strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a comprehensive revision of the system of public contracts and party funding: "We cannot go down; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story dims the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own courtyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona!
This season, you have taken a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day I move forward with them.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very quickly in football.
But I'm not on fire.
From my debut at the pre-formation centre of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by steps.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are used to playing high-level matches.
They also know that every training is crucial.
This makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Yeah, of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a great experience and has earned a lot of titles with huge clubs.
He has been with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting conversation with him.
I was coming out of a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
What are you looking at the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the leading place.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8ths of the final with the way.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our word to say in front of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, so that we can receive in the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means for this project to come true.
Would not win the title in Ligue 1, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this championship title.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champions.
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's the right one.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expects too much of the PSG?
“It’s normal that we expect a lot from us in view of what has been invested and the players we have.
We accept it completely.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame for, it’s certainly a little frustrating.
I wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set up a game project.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have proven that we could answer those who were present.
Look at Manchester City who hasn’t been able to qualify for the 8ths in two seasons, they’ve also made huge expenses!
In view of the amounts invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was to neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s exploits.
It's better to say that there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and sets a lot of goals.
He came for that and he proves that he is the star of League One.
He showed everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect both the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This drives others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from clumping up game time.
I saw things out there and I came out stronger.
I can do some good matches in the selection today.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we must have exemplary behaviour.
What do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the winning.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil.
Does the draw (1-1) in Spain on October 16 constitute a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current central bank-based currency exchanges, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing very impressive compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “in competition with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you earn by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes trade in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this type of system.
But each time, a central authority monitors and processes trade.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes on the network are both account book depositaries, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the way of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of accounts, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, sort of a provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a phase of file hashing, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeroes at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other knots easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided in two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred millionth, leaving margin.
The difficulty of the challenge is also seen with each increase in computational power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen.
“The fault used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-world payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this default.
Prominent actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, “giant sales” were launched.
“Threety thousand dollars have been traded,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a teaching book on this currency, believes greatly in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which come back cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to push forward, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former Pakistani refugee leaders, but often peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, such as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
The truck and armored convoys joined Kabul without being attacked, overflighted by helicopters.
There will be no defeat of the Taliban on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country of fire and blood due to the struggle between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had then been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overtaken by al-Qaeda's organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into affairsmen, seizing government land to sell it to building land to the refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from enormous U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They disappointed themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American widespreads: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young are tired of war and its ideologies.
They walked alongside the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they enjoyed the benefits of it.
Approximately 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, both girls and boys.
Work will need to be provided to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, love mobile phones; television, and its Turkish films that present a modern world, are tracked everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the position of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been restored, no dam is in condition, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise has been spread that Afghanistan possesses immense mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were there only to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or means of transportation to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, letting international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
It will also take some day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which imports and exports are largely dependent, will restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, French department at university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to accomplish the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, led to, and made successful by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and actions of rehabilitation in the agricultural dozens.
These works, gourmet in local labour, were able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A much lower budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often located at more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency of foreign groups, which farmers have told me to wish for, little civilian aid should be maintained in their favor, well controlled and directly affecting them.
A constitution with forceps in Egypt
This is another poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it full powers, it has decided to play his va-all.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted two more months to this House to finish its work.
It has been nearly two years since Egypt relied on a provisional text, repeatedly amended which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion," continuing to "traiting his word" and "pieds down law".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way of ending the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that requires the Brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as protests are raging across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the U.S. weekly Time.
The ultimatum to the Egyptian people is: "Either you vote for my text, or I retain full powers", which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent Assembly, a vast Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing the appeal.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked the door, saying they could not have made their views stand.
The same had been done by representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, replacing members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
Commentators also enjoyed the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee felt that the constituent's pendulum was poorly settled.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Object of all attention, article 2 remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed for a stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a proof of their goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," replied the Liberals, who see it only a blow of communication.
In their view, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include section 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the first fruits of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are further aroused by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system," said Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And in the future, the question might arise to what extent civil judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the military's wish, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more will civilian trials be prohibited in military courts, as required by human rights associations.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticide.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
Furthermore, no article echoes the protection of women anymore, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak last night on television, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the World Centre and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has selected five great reasons to visit Israel.
Go worship the holy places
Return to the shores of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these “baptism backgrounds” will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
This is where Jesus appeared before His disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers travel the street of suffering or the path of the Cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the Antonia Fortress (the pretory), where the trial took place, then led through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of Crucifixion, then to that of the Anointed Stone and tomb.
This is where the Christian center of the world is located, a symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the Cross Monastery is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew up.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the remainder of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then heard.
Traveling in height
Visit the ruins of Massada Fortress, an ancient refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this full of history summit.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m altitude, is the Mont Hermont ski resort, which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to live on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country houses nearly 300 museums.
It is not possible to visit all of them during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the tour.
First: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also see: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are mainly exhibited.
In Acre, Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of the moldings of the visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children’s memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars shine.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Dead Sea.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the temperature of the water does not fall below 21° while the temperature of the air can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim in it all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
Azure water contains brine and very easily retains swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
It comes to carry out a treatment based on salt water, lemon, healing sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of ancient times
They are kept by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists particularly like to walk through the narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the street walls corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile to you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet newlyweds who came to take photo sessions from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, King Herod's city, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "conquer" the crusaders' fortress.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you are going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
For urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the country's only metro line, composed of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The ride in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to Sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transportation cease their activity.
And the working week begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scale-free fish and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish dough, different sauces, ground chicken peas balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk around as proud air.
You can see them sleeping at night on the roofs of parked cars.
These cats love passing places and don't refuse to be eaten.
The rental of a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs on average 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, prior to the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who has language, go to Moscow": migrants save money to learn the language
As MEPs and human rights activists argue about what the mandatory language testing law will give, fraudsters selling “fake” certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families stay at home.
Since December 1, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
At present, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Immigration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law will need to be validated.
You will need to validate your language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Exempted are only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status.
Persons who have obtained certificates or educational diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this Act.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of exam centers will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of the Friendship of Peoples, the State University of Moscow, St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass exams in all cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what is it going to do?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, replies the representatives of the immigration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many are talking about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will 90% solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for unprofessional, untrained migrants, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is meant to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellow men will be tormented for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We are receiving many complaints from our migrants.
"In them, one thing is promised, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken their passports, and they do not get the planned salary," confirms the head of the Tajikistan Migration Service Works Branch, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, Mr. Policeman!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to come to Russia to make money confide not only in not knowing the language of the country they wish to visit, but also in writing with difficulty in their own language.
Of course it is not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to take even a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families don’t even have what to feed their children, let alone dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they come to adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity comes.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they trust.
"You feel decreased and decreased."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no examination or official work thereafter.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or Defense to Enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and still these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles of rubles.
And then, you can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police know that we have fake documents, that we have no records, hence cases of extortion.
"They are asking us for 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," Tajikistan's national Oumed Khushkadamov told reporters.
“Get quick, don’t let go and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was found that migrant registration papers were not the only ones that were false.
Several false language examination certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Counterfeit papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners didn’t take them for nothing: every migrant who so hoped to facilitate the task of exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is twice and a half more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power representatives and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “paper boxes”.
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first-stroke examination time to take language classes.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian weapons holders.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents, whether it be the shootings at marriages or the killings organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
Police want to prohibit wearing rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining the gun license from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the arms law would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "screwing the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net, in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demanded to abandon “this insane hardening.”
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a gun registered in police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that strengthening civilian weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supplying themselves to the black market.
According to them, today we can find any weapon in Moscow for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied via several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years at the Ministry of Education and the Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking arms commands
The first is the "military trace", i.e. weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
The illegal guns go on sale from the military warehouses.
Many of them have often experienced explosions.
"Verified versions indicate that some fires were triggered purposely to conceal the deficit," the former military said.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are for something.
“We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,” says an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
A significant share of guns and machine guns comes from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“We find a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the procurement,” the former military added.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat reports, criminal records and public data on weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there “because of employees whose work is related to weapons,” the report explains.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture, and 5% come from “clandestine searches.”
A vendor and consultant of an armory that asked to keep anonymity assures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these clandestine search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, he says, sellers will search for new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT gun.
It is handed over to him by passing the goods through a wire grid.
"He transports it to the city and resells it for €900 per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be clarified, they make a check purchase from illegal weapons dealers," he added.
"As in a luxury shop"
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I visited websites, blogs, until a guy manifested and offered me to come to the Begovaya station where someone became taking me into a "coin" to trade.
The price of the gun was given to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there we must also come and say, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to pass on that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I’m even buying a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only hands them over to me because he knows I won't give it.
The young people are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s as he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which he had "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," the military recalls.
There is no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we go with the seller in the forest and we set up a target.
"I'm being allowed to shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," the expert describes.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where weapons can be purchased "for different uses".
For this, we don’t need any documents and no one to meet.
“It’s enough to have a precise amount of money,” it was written in an advertisement on the website “Buy a gun or a fighting mitrail.”
Users leave their requests and ask their questions.
Are we selling to miners?
"Unpermitted, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (preserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of fake sites and picks up people wishing to purchase fighting weapons.
People crawl on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard of these types of schemes: generally, the site is saved outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take command.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, we can find ourselves without weapons and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has disseminated a huge network of fake sites and picks up people wishing to purchase fighting weapons.
“People crawl on food like hungry wolves and then find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a gun", one can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
It will take about a month and a half to wait.
It came out of the long-term warehouses by the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes decreased by overall 7% in Russia and amounted to 22.9 miles, while proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
U.S.: Fast-food and supermarket employees are on strike
About a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow larger or fade quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of leftist associations.
Alongside the modest increases in wages received by basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", as a floating rain of balances seizing millions of inhabitants fell on America and sometimes triggered splash.
On that day, some employees at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their positions to organize strike pickets with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart markets everything from diapers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuums, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid employees at Walmart are shopping only at their workplace.
The price and selection of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products inexpensively because of the low salaries of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded a salary increase, complaining that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who gets $9.5 per hour, it’s a sum he can’t afford.
Scientists at Berkley University in California show that if Walmart increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1 percent more than it is currently spending.
If Walmart transferred all the increased wages to consumers’ shoulders, each race in the store would be 46 cents more.
In just one year, they will spend $12.39 more than now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and caused no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8am in the evening to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items per second.
His cash registers totalled 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
Spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was just a "com-operation among many others" on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and also concerned Walmart stores (in this progressive city they are not much appreciated, which is why they are not yet installed there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s announces selling billions of servings and then they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage provided for by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase them over time, but on average, its core employees reach $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this town.
It is unimaginable for me to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their primary source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with that salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know what you’re going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the move on Thursday at 6:30 p.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks of fast food be paid at least $15 an hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing union protesters by harassment or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, seizing fast food remains a difficult task, and that for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They disagree
Other tumultuous protests were held near several other fast food chains.
The flagship moment of the protest was the midday gathering near Times Square McDonald's with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including that of Jumaane Williams, a city council member, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and after that they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you honestly did!"
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in sight, including Mayor's candidate Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support fast food employees so that they get a fair salary and the economic well-being that each New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, not all of whom were fast food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is for the moment difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"For the moment, we can only mediumly deceive the brain."
Recently, fans of new technologies have become used to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, shows that for the company’s scientists, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and we are trying at the same time to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has for the moment remained at the pixels on a flat screen and sometimes at the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in ordering by gesture.
- What does the future also hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has rendered physical interaction, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, is not really.
We’re trying to change that and we’re working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to bring the computer world out into ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds them.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It is appreciated, but is it not overestimated?
It cannot be said that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of their actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought we had gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, narrow gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the apparatus, but by a hand-worn bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass that can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or does not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual reconciliation.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If you are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you dislike in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely on our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this latter point, all current technologies are fairly good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
It is important to keep in mind the resolution of X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s really aren’t enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche of our Redmond laboratory gave the touch of the sensors a regular processing delay between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device like this in my work, but it doesn't need to touch, to have more frames in the second.
Shouldn’t the number of cameras be increased?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflected signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem.
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a soft product similar to the Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how it could help set locations.
"As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone with hands raised is not convenient but here is what I think: the best option would be a "transitory" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that’s what makes their strength (personal items are the ones you’re the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from the glasses won’t allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is only accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents of this idea point their finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
What are your group’s responses to this challenge?
In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually meant to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of your fingers.
There are also the bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve ends of the fingers, they are also a working axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him believe that he feels what he normally should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There’s still one task underneath that will take a long time to try: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we’re working on the concepts of running carpets (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only mediumly deceive the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "L'avant-garde pétersbourgeoise" dedicated to urban citizens who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg artistic scene whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the parties and trendy varnishes.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always bring crowds together, regardless of their place of exhibition.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersburg narrators, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petrograd avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the locals smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a tailor specialized in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray provokes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize that you were supposed to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, of my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to be friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina which gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took my place in Pushkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Bohemian Petrograd.
Many were born there: The NAMEs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
Chnour and his friends were singing easy playback songs in blue jerseys, including Igor Vdovin, a modern composer.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhenberg lived a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was with us that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboïedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the last century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the "Personalities of our city" award.
I was named “Painter of the Year,” and that’s when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong actuality and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through the Clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it's scary to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything goes away, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the clothing that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give her a hand, but rather we have to spit her in the trunk.
And the lies will be erased by the disguise.
Recently, we saw you as the organ player of Barbary, a cultural town must have this kind of hero.
Who else but me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art needs to be cared for, delicate, liquorous.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, the bohemians loved one thing, the deniers loved another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people we threw out who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and in the end it's less management, money, everything is ruined.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually painted at the end of my life.
Nowadays, ideas are often confused.
It is said that there is spiritual culture, consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that the good experts should be kept.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are ruled out because it takes higher experts who will correctly assess these experts and open a path for them.
Currently, it is the “taste kingdom” that flowers.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for that.
And on our stones, art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In our home, this layer is very thin.
We need to make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Scholarship
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a murderous asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with Earthmen on board are heading out in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to live our species in weight or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's a lot of choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, even if only by hypothesis.
"These are Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
We can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, there were experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from Earth varieties.
Then we put insects, small reproductive drosophilic flies, into orbit.
In 1979, cod eggs were sent into space to see how a weighty embryo was developing.
At the exit we get a quite normal chicken.
Then the problems start.
"The problem is that the chick has to find support, it has to get on its legs and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
With no support, the chicks agitated in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chickens did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We stabbed their eyes twice, then gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of experimenting with chicks in space.
The latest biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " will only ship species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"They were still biosatellites, and then this is the only experiment, and we need to do this kind of research," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of space gave birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
It's not a thin affair.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable of doing so in principle.
The Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is what humanity has most valuable.
Our moss flew and no one on Earth could tell if it would stand after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
"No one was answering this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retiree from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology laboratory of the Centre for Cosmonaut Preparation: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero floatability, cosmonauts train for extra-vehicular exits.
Water mimics the weight.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibian men seem to confirm that life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby moves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to water.
This is in principle logical, since from birth to first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born the weight is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weight, the muscles of the stomach, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's pushing ability is lost.
All right, let's ignore this by relying on the birth simulators.
Of course you can prepare a childbirth in a special room, the woman will manage to get it out.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the attraction of the earth, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You cannot dress a infant like an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
“And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, wholly disabled,” said Igor Pestov, Director of the Bioethics Committee at the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems at the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a theory.
However, with time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution for the Control of Public Finance) said: "The control of self-employed work (in Czech " Švarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but is lagging behind with regard to its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Superior Institution for the Control of Public Finance, said in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is missing from us," Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint check conducted by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar findings.
As an example of abusive practice, he cited Petr Nečas' approach to the "Švarc system".
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG is not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls; is it allowed or prohibited?
“The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority in charge of going to inspect demanding compliance with the law,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the House of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German draft in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was it about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
Simply put, EU legislation provides for managing public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as a practice itself, which follows it.
We have gathered all of this together and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, there are very interesting differences that appear to us: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps "stronger and better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not sufficient to develop more and more detailed rules on an ongoing basis, but that it is necessary to focus on the very implementation of the law.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it result for you?
Common control of this kind should contribute precisely to the fact that we stop striving to clarify laws, to lower and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those looking for the faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal issues regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a different mode of organization?
As for the institutions, similarly to the ISC, there operates the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it also has a council constituted a little differently, but these two institutions do basically similarly.
The competences are also, to some extent, similar, but with a nuance in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such accounts at the level of the various Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to our state resources.
The public funds managed by our regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder's accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it can certainly not be said to do better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, surely not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we see as a model, also faces a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As for national legislation, what has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment to the Public Procurement Act, are its effects already felt?
Since this amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has yet to have an impact on our control operations.
As we do checks a posteriori, we have to count with a certain delay.
Our observations are currently only about the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new "risk detection of mismanagement" instrument with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public procurement - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions for certain types of tender procedures and so on.
So do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or an extra burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules are becoming more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the regime of previous regulations, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the market law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more stringent in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put greater pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the SDG was not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does it mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting in charge of inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He may declare, "We will change the law and allow it," but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was.
The Contracts Act has relatively strict rules on the formalities to be fulfilled, precisely to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair, and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are frozen, but most remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowed.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practicable this morning, but in frozen and snowed places.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5° and -10°C but they are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfalls have ceased in the area and there is only a thin layer of snow left in the plains.
However, the ridges of the Metallic Mountains (Krušné hory) are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service show that due to the fog, visibility was reduced in places.
The R6 highway and national roads in the region are now practicable without difficulty.
However, vigilance remains to be placed, for example on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-class tracks, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There are still remaining remains of frozen snow on some of their sections and in places crowded by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Road and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice cream and that traffic-hungred snow layers can be found on roads in mountainous and altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is found mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a traffic-compressed snow layer is present on roads in areas located at altitude.
In East Bohemia, the weather will be dry, mostly clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally range between -3° and +1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practicable, although in some places it is necessary to be more vigilant and to adapt its conduct to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures range from -3° to -9° C.
After the latest snowfalls and the cooling that followed, some communication channels may be in frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is evident from the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
Highway D5 is practicable almost without difficulty, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometers 80 and 131.
The coating of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the district of Pilsen-South and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental and third-class roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers need to be vigilant, especially on less busy roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers traveling to areas of the Olomouc region at altitude now have to count on a thick, soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical processing operations.
The snowfalls forced road maintenance personnel to travel to the ground this night; according to the road services responsible, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most roads are practicable without difficulty.
" On the heights of the district of Šumperk there are remains of snow.
Drivers driving towards Jeseník must expect to meet at the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass a thick and soft layer of snow ", the head of road maintenance services of the district of Šumperk told ČTK today.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also traveled overnight; according to the latter, after chemical treatment, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district roads are practicable without difficulty, however in the Šternberk district drivers should be careful in sections in forest areas with remaining wet roads.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, North Bohemian road maintenance services reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some snow- and ice-covered places, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústeku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitude, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially southeast of the central Bohemian Plateau, there are, on the contrary, no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice cream, particularly in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melting during the day, clear sky and frost during the night.
It is also reported, from the main traffic axes, difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees which have curved under the weight of snow until reaching the roadway.
Šimon Ornest said: “In concert, we want to collect positive energy.”
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are laughing and saying that we are the only group capable of collecting a residue of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you’re embarking on a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce this project to our readers in more detail?
This is a charity that we have been preparing for two years now.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end practically at the time the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati, which lies in the Pacific Ocean, ends at a 12-hour time zone ahead of us.
Who got this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Aside from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by purchasing them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled " End of the Cancelled World " (in Czech " Konec světa zrušeno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it at these charitable concerts too?
Of course, all at the end, at last, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn’t happen...
It will be sung simultaneously by all performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also be joined at some point in a very unique live broadcast from Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also has the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities from the Czech biz show, because of the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We strive to make them participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it entertains them.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo Training Centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on as part of the Jedlička Institute, with the association Tap, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest them and entertain them.
Students themselves don’t have the means to get to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers go on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria have you chosen them?
We have tried to develop a programme for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will be on stage.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other “mega events” of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; there, too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech House in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as terrible as it looks at first.
We have five members in an electric chair whose machines must travel in a bunk, of course we also trimble a lot of luggage and instrument boxes....
So far everything has gone more or less always well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we came home recently, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, public attitude toward people with disabilities, and so on.
What have your experiences been so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that the East is all only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet regard it as an obvious priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, an association is also being created there to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot we're still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and improvements are always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone into public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the cutting edge of progress!
Public respect and accessibility are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we have somewhat lost control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only come in recent years, if I am not wrong?
It is true, linking with well-known singers and working actively to promote the band has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to the European Union grants, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Was your goal to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts for a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare affirm that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, whom we must take in pity.
They are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities succeed in achieving something, it’s not just a step forward for them but for the whole society.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be uncompromising in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think that's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they need to come to the rehearsals twice a week, attend preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Only one, Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come in and go, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to anyone who wants or wants to join us.
This will be the case on the day before the planned day of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012, starting at 9 p.m.
The event will take place in Prague at Incheba Arena, Brno at Fléda and Ostrava at Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
In the late evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when jointly singing The Tap Tap group's song "End of the World Cancelled".
The aim of the concert is to raise financial resources (to the amount of CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional training centre Studeo located in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The ticket price for this concert is CZK 400, entry is free for children up to 12 years old, pre-sale tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency and is the second member state of the former Eastern Bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed participated in a number of ESA projects.
The road from Poland to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always encounter understanding.
I would like to refer, for example, to A. Šternfeld's conference at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw, on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde work entitled " Introduction to Astronautical Science " .
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his book "Introduction to the Astronautics".
The said Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of world-renowned astronauts, his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925 a drain was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the drain.
The only known information about this drain is that of the press at the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzyckiego.
The documents preserved show that this research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photoelectric fighter rocket, drawn by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were led by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its operations.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronautical society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a company in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problem, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to the astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) deployed efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the International Astronaut Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters was 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently an improved version, RM-1A was built and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the RM-2 two-stage rocket were started in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and served to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM-type rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they distinguished themselves by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B it was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C was 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of machinery was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is still worth mentioning Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision has raised a vivid debate in the public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to consider this issue from a broader point of view.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This concretely means that the different economic entities as well as national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and the free (without limits) movement of private capital combined with limited financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour price (wage) generate tension on prices.
The following meaning should be put under this term: a producer strives by importing low-cost goods to withstand economic competition by "making the competitor's price more expensive" in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying at low prices or disappearing, resulting in high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it creates, the social burdens of the State necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect evil will of gentlemen and entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so publicly known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital generate in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is mainly evident in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically force its own population to accept the dictate of private capital prices, especially in the area of wages.
This occurs, on the one hand, through a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, through the restriction of employee rights in the field of labour law.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the RFA, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years that cannot support their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a supplement to achieve the vital minimum.
Such a scandal has been updated, for example, in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all southern EU Member States generate, without a doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that their country will emigrate.
We have to ask ourselves the question: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media claim, tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the led economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to wonder whether private capital does not influence, and even does not, today, govern, according to its own selfish interests, politics and, by the same means, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is a virtually almighty lobby that is present in all states.
This results in a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in the legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In the AFR, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national departments delegate the drafting of laws to industry-related law firms.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The whole of power does not come from the people, as the Western constitution declares, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberal democracies are now rapidly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompeius": "The state has long been in full depletion and functions were attributed by violence.
Bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-table and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with votes already sold" ... "Honest people didn't seek at all to obtain offices, it resulted once the state had absolutely changed mind eight months without consuls." ... "We really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose a man."
In conclusion, as in ancient times, today's society is based on preference for personal profit, regardless of the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer capable of understanding and enforcing the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as in the past, a decline without preceding elites, without any effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the present state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that today's elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human life losses, the humanitarian and social crises that we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and internally, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase citizens' influence on government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and will never be able," Sting said in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild’s wife on his death bed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have arisen.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurring murders; in short, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, have been born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a view placed "behind the curtain", on the one that benefits mainly from the tensions that have already persisted for more than 95 years (since the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small bit of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely of the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals act independently or whether they owe their acts on the throne to someone who directed their acts according to previously defined goals.
We must admit that we are living in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been possible in a single generation.
Among the families possessing astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered as the head of the poop (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude him).
Little is written about them.
Yes, of course.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world's first news agency (Reuters) to put an end to the linkage between their names and serious criminal acts with which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth, or both.
They have major interests in almost most central banks in the world and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such interests (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries was 7, after the Russian invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi of only 4, while the Russian government was under control.
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew central bank status at the Bank of America of the Rothschilds and began to issue his own money during the civil war (governmental, I hear well) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 as he wanted to bring a lawsuit against the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the global level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a 33rd-degree initiated Freemason, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population by between 1 and 0.5 billion people (so many slaves are sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (absolute ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution and power).
The method used by the clan of the wealthiest families with the Rothschilds at their heads is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to avoid repeating crises like the ones they caused in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering the First World War by the assassination of Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War suddenly ended with a German surrender without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: they, on the one hand, imposed on Germany a great deal of minor war repairs, thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it was enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic nationality, showing the finger of the guilty, and proposing a simple solution).
In the late nineteenth century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of the branches of which aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration laid the foundation for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorism was committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had held him initially; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps laid the foundation for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war repairs imposed on Germany were the cause of World War II, the founding of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could cause a Third World War.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during World War II, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of disagreement and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just see how people sharply divide between Israel’s supporters and defenders).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong bears another wrong in a circle of endless violence, and where the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world is the source of everything?
Here we have to distinguish between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as with us, the international bankers offer people in elections only their own candidates.
The current naval prime minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to the membership of this country to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) strait extend to become a global conflict and, given the Gold control, a world economy of 2 miles.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said: “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth by an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
“Let them compel all individuals, small and big, rich and poor, free and slave, to carry on their hand or forehead a mark with red iron, so that they may not buy or sell anyone who does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that whoever has common sense counts the numbers of this fierce beast.
This number denotes man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six.”
The film Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators composed of Islamist students assaulted the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a tough blow for the US prestige, further exacerbated later by the fiasco of the attempt to liberate hostages by force.
The abducted diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked in the United States a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian feeling.
The Iranian debacle contributed heavily to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated circumstances, they met at the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran with a rocambolesque coverage: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a shooting team coming to make spots for shooting a big science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is a part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful blow, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres follow one another: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the era of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were retranscrit in the film, there are no great differences),
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in remarkably starting his career.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his play as an actor stopped arousing ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
This is also Affleck's first film not taking place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo, where the role of Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, when reconstructing real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy fall is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a story page is written.
Affleck and his collaborators obtain a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the false shooting team in Tehran’s bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to content himself with a subject offering in fact few exciting scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It is doing well, sometimes it adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the landing track is quite pulled by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in some way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated nature of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the business.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnikovpoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public survey of the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to launch the contest of the settlement or the most absurd ideas coming from the "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering adopting a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of major European companies in recent times has been the source of our decision," said Patrik Nacher, organizer of the survey.
Among the absurds mentioned are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have been advantaged in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop" until the end of the year.
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the price increase directive on the size of the chicken cages, which has led to this.
In the past, criticism has also been made against the factual ban on the use of the term "toast butter" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
The quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (the Czech Republic thus currently imposes the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the heart of the fact that in the Union, bananas should not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonizing non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
Fruit and vegetable standards have been softened despite the opposition of some States, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year’s EU regulation that should include a warning on inflatable balloons that children under 8 should not swell without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to a U.S. survey that balloons are among toys the leading cause of children’s death from choking.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
We also have some weird ideas at home.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this theme for Greece, anyone who has an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez-Faire" of Liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this investigation, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurds, the EU regulations on the volume of food stocks on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and, as a result, risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants interested.
These ideas, however, were not from Brussels but from Prague.
“The fact that we don’t have a sea disabled us.
In the autumn of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), spoke in a statement.
He argued that due to our production of wheat, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had ended up with full stocks that it had subsequently to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were specifically intended to serve to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU declares: "Bizarre regulations are rare."
Although regulations often arouse criticism in Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of its overall development are rather worthy of praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of using EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, must fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it does not always win) raises strong emotions among the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", for the name "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar alcohol products, not beet sugar, may bear the name of rum.
In the official list of EU registered products, today we find in the company of world-renowned cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the Lübeck bread or the Parma ham, the Karlovy Vary biscuits and the Pohořelické suchary, the Pohořelice and Třeboboň carps.
Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Hořice Cornets " ("hořické trubíčky") can also be proud of their community brand.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur,” says Senator Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how did we get the idea of running for the presidential election?
It’s not being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not under lock and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I'm trying to find a solution to make it change.
And since I’m over forty years old and I’m an independent member of no party, I have no other way to influence the situation than to run for presidential or senate elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set off to the Château (N.D.T.: headquarters of the Presidency).
Do you not turn your back to those who have chosen you?
I have always said that I will fight for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I said that if I were elected a senator, I would run for the presidential election.
My goal is not function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the widest mandate.
The problem isn't just that as a nation we're laughing at the bar or in front of our television station, but it's also that we're footing those who try to make change.
In addition, the press breaks people’s reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I am bribing journalists or that I was the adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Castle with the themes of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
For this purpose, you have to change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, put pressure on tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained judgment.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma supporters, to take from each side what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you think of yourself as a right-wing or left-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people put me rather to the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we go ahead.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you are a populist?
But doesn’t what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of the parliament, you have only slogans left.
You won’t survive for long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have another option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast on television my request to parliamentary party presidents to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they don’t want it.
When there is a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, it was obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, without ambiguity, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just started politics and I am trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying alone to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It is a bit like Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, so I went to a number of personalities to ask them to run for Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote, and what they did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose change.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election by direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to establish your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is flawless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have money for my presidential campaign either, I have only twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate at about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth eight million, a collection of artwork worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million in my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid’s dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving in the car, was galant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a wealth worth 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
Do you want to change the Republic but don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I have already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program doesn't raise much interest.
I have no obligation to pay this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign fees are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, pay my son's English school that costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I wouldn’t run for any election.
Are you going to continue your business in order to live?
Didn't you say that you'd put your activities into deafness?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live from something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I continued to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that true adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince yourself, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
“I think this building is funny, it’s very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,” Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the lower side of the street, told us.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a large neighboring company, tells us, "Yes, this building is really beautiful."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the internet, an iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, no one willingly goes to one of these crazy libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore a few neurons to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty small miniatures of painted armed concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
Thus the city authorities realized that there was only one way to take over the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV Architects Office, bold master of stick diagrams and creator of mindful and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a laughing on the face.
And while the jury members still looked at each other, confused and shaking their shoulders, Maas, the madman, stacked his books of choice by order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by an activist argument: "Common dear!"
Here is my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain burst from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 houses.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus this dull little town, which to this day had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall of amazing uglyness, whose white façades suggest that they house a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under a cheese bell.
Sure, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you step down the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant street lights unequivocally speak the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play the ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally, the library shelves are located along the facade and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We completely upset the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been well designed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental center and the building’s technical center.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes paintings, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened building architects and engineers do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in an agricultural company.
In the Netherlands, synthetic membrane of one millimeter thickness has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers a stunning view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is adjusted by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books lies beneath a glass bell, the sun illuminates little time inside, even in the days of good weather.
The thick wooden beams cross-mounted relative to the glass facade serve as a sunscreen, intercepting much of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned Septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even described the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "finally found soul."
Indeed, a few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has helped fill the gaps of the library that was not yet fully filled (today it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half empty library."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV achieved the master discipline called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany decided to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the request of Palestinians to obtain observer status with the United Nations.
But then she decided to abstain.
- Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the US position either.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 Libyan insurrection, Germany also voted to abstain in the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
At the end of the day, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is revising its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to introduce a German foreign policy.
Furthermore, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are confronted on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still tapping to find this role, but they are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy, as in France or Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national dossiers.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hit the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is at least a decisive element in German strategic reflections.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I think the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States announced its veto with a clear voice.
Does the opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But given the country’s political configuration, the government can’t, of course, defend its position publicly.
I think the real differences in opinions are not as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don’t think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
They cannot therefore fit into a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a locomotive role in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany play a major role on the international stage, does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it still difficult to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable for it and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulty playing a more important role.
If you look at, for example, the euro crisis, you notice that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with neighbors and opinions very varied, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this gap, so who remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant for them and if they're only less appreciated of it, it's life!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Washington Transatlantic Academy, an institute where academics and policy experts from Europe and North America jointly analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, U.S. foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known brands worldwide.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark that is officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing its name cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, it's not sure she'd get a win of cause.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my desk.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a workbook containing records made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma brand, a name that the firm artificially created by taking over part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and intellectual property violation.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping centers that sell virtually only counterfeits.
However, the cases of Pattloch are different: his mandates charge him with addressing the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry wealthy men are designated.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” demands Pattloch.
“The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous.”
Financial losses and legal expenses are in millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of €15 billion, the world’s third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to delete dubious records from the trademark registry and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports on the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long time, the criticized denomination had become a "reality of the market."
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist because he would have harmed his trademark in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the Putzmeister concrete pump manufacturer.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo acquirer, used a blue-and-white logo that reminded us of that of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to modify it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiarists in Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the famous crocodile’s gaze in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits, however, to have experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, last year the office reportedly moved from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a normal recovery".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, which represents a 75% increase compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the office.
Acting is expensive
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, OCMW received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is at the top for the tenth consecutive time in the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, each recorded an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as is illustrated in the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Certainly, the Germans were able to obtain that illegal manufacturing of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault because surnames cannot be protected in Germany,” said Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The Trademark Office therefore rejected the Munich people's objection.
Freudenberg certainly won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, difficult and costs us a lot of time and money."
Internal costs are also difficult to assess, and the archival department has even had to review the records of the past 100 years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large six-digit euro sum" to resolve the dispute.
“That’s what it means for us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region were to ensure the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file the name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Watchfulness is required."
Pattloch and him advise German companies to be very cautious in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they believe, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather “register everything that is likely to be protected in China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay licensing fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking foot, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and Swaziland’s AIDS orphans look forward to their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that goes far beyond a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, ladies sneakers and men sneakers are looking for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they overwhelm, enchant and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
It’s Monday evening, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singer-songwriters aged 23 to 69 came, from geneticist in human medicine to the man of the household.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choirist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Being helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storytelling" or "singer of praise".
No one can fluently speak the Bantu language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has repeated songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to now return to its native region: South Africa.
For at 8,733 kilometres bird flying from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the voice power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some living in modest huts of straw or soil and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, the smaller scale of ailments affecting Swaziland is the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population virtually never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is carrying the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis saw mostly many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a school degree, there is absolutely no prospect.
At first, they were only a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year in order to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir was founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since taken care of Esitjeni's AIDS orphans almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
The lice of the pubis and the scale belong to the parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhagia often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men causes at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhea and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany, however, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
The rate of chlamydia-related infections is significantly higher in young people than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Furthermore, in Germany, human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years: from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has declined.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, lower abdomen pain, as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they regularly cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms may decrease the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or through close body contacts.
Therefore, experts recommend that anyone who frequently changes sexual partners take regular examinations.
Most rapidly screened STIs can be cured and late sequels can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorships, donations, but above all the funds that the choirists collect through their voices throughout Germany, the funds accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, so called the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken farms. With the help of the U.S. Health Organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not of course, because even if the disease is visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his fourteen wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it is a subject that affects sexuality.”
This is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Nevertheless, there are condoms at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to encourage cultural exchange, the choirs of Imbongi travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know about apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is such a sign of recognition that it not only yields good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears away a few fearsome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the choirists visit their children.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
“Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there,” people say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres by bird, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choir players who tap foot in the rehearsal room of Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal Science.
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the area of the planet constantly in the shadow.
This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one links the discovery of water to the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, says Messenger probe chief scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other vital elements of life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which one observes the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, orbiting the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the new definition of the term of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of the countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "new-born" in the birth room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered the region where stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopea, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope has photographed the flaming shine of a star dying.
The donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifide nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birthroom.
The Pleiads, star clusters also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope highlights the colors more.
In this infrared photo, the Helix nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the spectator.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of the Aquarius.
His resemblances to a land-based continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture a picture of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs the Hubble telescope has ever taken is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifide nebula in the Sagittarius constellation, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trails divide the shining heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the firsts of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Serpent: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two melting galaxies rush toward each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "southern fire wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is composed of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than usual domestic dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic photographs taken by different telescopes.
The circle of black holes is 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosetta nebula, also continuously create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the big bang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its peculiarity is due to its high capacity for collecting light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the radiotelescope of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the “Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI) by contributing the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope (“Very Large Telescope”), an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take shots before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire him.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mostly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the launch of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists believe that Mercury’s South Pole also contains ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data have indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are still sure of this.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country in which we are still relatively young at age 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country in which we are still relatively young at age 97.
The journey to the Talysh Mountains is of an arduous romanticism.
Around the many turning points of the road, the small bus cahotes along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, almost like in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh lives, about whom little is known, except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town is flamboyant with its too aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not match the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
“Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the world’s oldest people,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only such museum in the world.
There you can discover the lives of about eight dozen Talysh of the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Have a child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would have still conceived a daughter.
Has Şirali Müslümov been wrong for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of the old man of Central Asia.
“Surprisingly elderly people also live in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “in Sardinia, too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the absence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil record.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, it is true that people in the Lerik region often reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tour guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem plausible that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground next to a bar, whose content she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, among them one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little kids are also wandering in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armed glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf hide long braids of a dark blonde that her son proudly reveals to us.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I have never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst times were after World War II.
But everything improved when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda amazes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who ruled his country as a dictator, almost knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, after which his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan are not aware of the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, an amount that guarantees a good living in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long graying son is right: "The elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution was reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the country’s profound fracture.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy with words filled with emotion.
We need to succeed in the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God,” he told state television.
His speech was aimed at the entire people, but also especially the Christian Coptics, the Liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the laity.
For all members of the confused and desperately disunity opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi declared, almost by apologizing, that he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers "in order to save the revolution."
However, Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer wants to save, holding a doctorate from the American University of Southern California.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles prepared in a rush by the mostly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night force tour are indeed to some extent of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was, and still remains, a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the legal maneuverability thereof to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia.
In any case, it is suggested that a newly introduced article stipulating that, with respect to all subjects concerning Sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brightness radiates over the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would de facto lead to the supervision of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely retention of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts worked to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The state must also, it can be read in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the contents of art cinematography and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees gender equality.
Instead, another article prohibited from offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offense people."
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawmaker?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The revolution was renewed"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual agreement on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down Sharia before it comes into force.
“The revolution is reborn and we will win,” says Hamdin Sabbahi, who arrived third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is “to be thrown into the trash of history.”
On Twitter, the instant messaging service accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to encourage a “putsch against democracy.”
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned,” Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member, told Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges said they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim brotherhood called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in it in large numbers, shouted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an was their Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would have quickly generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that’s what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as its supporters, had spoken loudly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the polls on the direction of the country.
The Islamists’ project will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have prolonged until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he said during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are cries against the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers,” Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, watching the battle between different political ideologies on the Nile bank with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid for.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: "You're giving birth to a monster that you won't be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: Is it the most odorous fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to the appetite of the locals for an extremely smelling fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes in Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air.
Rakfisk consists of salt-spottered trout and fermented in water for a period - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can last up to a year.
When darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for the festival's management.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and indulge in a large amount of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavity to rakfisk," adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid putting it under your nose, it's not bad - it reminds you of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in water barrels sealed in the air, and then salted in the autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - undoubtedly with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating primarily to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted to full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, crossed the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, though odorant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway doesn't often talk about it in international news, which he doesn't like.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about “the July 22 incident.”
The Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their peaceful country one of them may have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason for our success,” says Anna, our waitress, with the blonde hair and the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk plate in hand.
We are - as you say - prudent people.
His English, like most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we don't like to be spotted.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money out of the windows, over the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its stock exchange tight.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Without forgetting rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laughter.
I stand under the snow and line up to buy me something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger composed of momentum, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay in is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most odorous of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly knot, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Jürgen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is experiencing a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the challenges awaiting him and the many expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor right now.
In a city where traffic jams are a normal legion, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to their work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits you.
Mexico’s economy is doing well, with the results we owe to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is facing a drug war that has already killed about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Bureau earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populous and tentacular state that encloses the capital. On its favorite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M. Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of cracks.
Plates bearing his name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We count on him to bring about lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so much needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was evicted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the highway bridges, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called for rescue to combat drug gangs in neighborhoods, and the violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disastered area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years were found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's critics say, at best, he failed to address the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this decaying neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to retain her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the cadaver rigidity had already started.
As his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word appears: Justice.
This is exactly what the family has been refused.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old comer, a troubled one, a crying one.
They want us to accept what they say and shut up.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as president as he was when he was governor," Olvera told Congressman Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning was allegedly the victim of during the detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's abduction took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate Friday that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the cause of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military -- has missed numerous occasions to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have undergone during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that recordings of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The counter-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a petition demanding that the Manning case be seized on the grounds that the kidnapping was under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were subsequently published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms the officers had filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards gave him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in the prison was overall "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his treatment in prison, Fein said.
Manning replied that he orally expressed concerns about certain issues and that the officers visited had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the issues mentioned.
“They wrote ‘no problem’ (after addressing concerns), and yet that didn’t mean that I hadn’t raised any problems,” Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a “risk of injury.”
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was well, and I wanted to be withdrawn from this status ... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to military prison from the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he thought of committing suicide when he was in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept aware of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very anxious.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or staying lying during the day was contrary to regulation.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn’t see his face when he turned at night, they would wake him so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning's treatments in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked for an entire night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover up with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard's order that he should release his blanket that could have hid his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release her.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his pant or tongs to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, tongs, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he experienced during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty in a martial court, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning is considering pleading guilty of the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the rules governing the conditions of detention of all inmates in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of national defence information.
If all charges are detained, he shall be sentenced to life in criminal detention.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the hall, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two paths: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicos"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stayed still for several seconds, not knowing to which line to go.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the "Mexico" all my life.
This is an ethnic qualification, just like the one my Boston friends use when they say “Irish,” or my New York friends when they say “Italy.”
Then I became “Mexico-American.”
But here it was Mexico.
And on the earth where my grandfather was born, there is no need for any special qualification or trait of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed to the "Foreigners" line.
I thought of that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk in the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans undermine their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the one that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexico-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom the country does not offer.
The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And most of the time, that person matched a typical profile -- a dark skin, uninstructed, coming from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we should never lose sight that it is the American dream we are living in, not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they rough us as if we were individuals of lower strain and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, because Mexicans are more strongly claiming their identity and Mexico-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is a U.S. citizen, she feels like she is a member of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexico-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are regarded as Americans.
And in the United States, we are regarded as Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that we absolutely need to visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to do it on your own, amigos.
Oh, that's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-Americans always want them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicoans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While the same futile arguments persist for who began, dozens of buildings have been dusted; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full change.
The Arab Spring has broken everything up, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up by this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that this could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Even though the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast of having forced Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has scratched.
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals from Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might think that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is becoming increasingly strong, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a thriving regional power, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has taken over done and cause for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the wealthiest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members rejoice and say that the growing Islamist curves around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where Hezbollah’s militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and even Jordan, where Hamas’ allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are easier to rely on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in a box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have reproached Hamas for being the source of the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has thrived, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza rocket fires have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared from suicide attacks, notably thanks to the separation barrier that hits the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their international illegal law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more militant party, that of Leader Avigdor Lieberman as the January 22 election approaches, has the beautiful side.
Why do these fucking Palestinians suffer by giving them a state?
If they were to run the West Bank, wouldn’t they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of the head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win; but it may be the Arab Spring that changes the way.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate Israel little, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments arrange their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire, which is good-looking -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a dusthouse that is doomed to explode one day in Israeli-occupied territories – a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population grows.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, both small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which now has to strive to stop the circulation of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with ground exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming proposal of a pseudo-state at the UN.
Obama is also interested in Israel’s acceptance of negotiating.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
This is a very narrow view.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for neutral cigarette packets have entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
The law, which entered into force in Australia, is a world premiere, with logos and colors being replaced by a dark olive green and horrible pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small letters on all the packages.
This is the world's strictest tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
“Even when they’re very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco makers through their brand image,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children were associating the crown of a logo with a princess.
Even though Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pushed against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would revive the black market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
“Negative consequences will arise from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask horrible packaging, has grown sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to the High Court of Australia.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.
For us, the business is good.
The only annoyance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you’re working in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the must-see place by excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed an increase in contributions from some lambda citizens to brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask ourselves if this is a mere citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the time to make a video, or is it a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations in force rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be made in 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I ignore them.
“You take a cigarette and you put the pack in place,” Victor El Hage said at the time of buying a pack with a picture of the mouth tumor.
To be honest, the only reason I'm arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, managing director of the “King of the Pack tobacanist” in downtown Sydney, said packaging uniformity made it difficult to store packages on shops.
"Before I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
“The government had only to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it’s okay, we stop and we put the key under the door,” he added, raising our arms to heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport to wait for a flight is boring enough, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract yourself (not to mention duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths and even feed creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boring.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I don't.
But I'll come back.
First, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The boredom goes back very far,” he said.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in various ways, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After reviewing numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experiment that consists of "willing to do something but failing to get into a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though he would like it.
With apathy, he said, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is “the interruption of the attention process, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly.”
Boring can look like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while both can be linked, boring people tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we get bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the newspaper "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some bands heard, coming from the next room, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no reports, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard low-noise TV said they were more bored than the other two groups - they struggled to concentrate, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a challenging or engaging task, an attention disruption can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like watching objects on a editing line, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you twist or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to snorkel learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay without moving," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a single-corded voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a “Body Predisposition Scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Among the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotone," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blased.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know whether today’s boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” especially because children and adolescents don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is boring good for you?
Sometimes no, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, bet or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Borry is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he will not get bored anymore, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or self-regulation, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation moves from one situation to another," he says.
Not only does your child learn to entertain, they get more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don’t think we should criticize it either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant bubbling that activities and technology generate is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boring arouses an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
“In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and soccer player in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quote to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor offences, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on place than on law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been classified without follow-up.
Police have ceased to charge adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado districts have called for accelerating existing marijuana affairs and continue to charge people who own marijuana.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the West Mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales shops in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so fast that I don’t know what the future holds for us,” said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora Police Chief, east of Denver.
The regulators of the State of Washington are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a license system, authorizing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether or not we like it, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first in terms of therapeutic use and now in terms of personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, acknowledges Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent we could rely on," he said.
The Washington Act, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain outstanding: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis sales shops within a radius of 30 km around a school, park, playground or nursery.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up an authorized cannabis sales shop, especially in Seattle’s metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the cannabis legalization center, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates in Aurora sent an email to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should cease to charge people for such an "immediate effect" crime.
Chief Oates said the police would enforce the new court rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district attorney" Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession affairs, primarily to put pressure on users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of further charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those persons who committed a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence," Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative to restrict marijuana consumption.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer make adults appear for possession of limited quantities.
The county public prosecutor’s representative, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to classify all cases of marijuana detention without follow-up.
“I don’t feel like I waste my time continuing to apply the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and governmental framework for personal marijuana consumption is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with public prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of marijuana use and speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they’re struggling to accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are on the verge of becoming a case case for legalizing drugs.
While advocates and state representatives are planning a new boundary of legalized sales, they are worried about the federal government's guidelines, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates for legalization of marijuana hope the Ministry of Justice will cease.
Despite some media arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mainly allowed marijuana sales businesses for therapeutic purposes to practice in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are likely not going to squeeze the doors to seize small bags of drugs, there is a lot to bet they are opposed to authorized marijuana sales shops authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities have not waited for the federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales shops, even if this is just a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose that ban next week.
“We don’t want to end up in a situation where a license is granted to someone and then we’re facing a federal problem,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the community's vote rather than the state's vote.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It’s not just today’s students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in what was for me a prominent place of knowledge, a kind of modern Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Writer A. N. Wilson declared with fantasy that I was gone after being forced to drink in scratched cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been the victim of bullying and the subject of constant harassment.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my regrettable father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about this today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of center-right students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as did those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Student Room (JCR) at Corpus Christi College said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted” because of their political views.
They want to have a representative in the University Committee on Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", devoted to student politics, and portraying the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Student Joe Cooke, former chairman of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), travels in Rolls-Royce, carries a full silver and moves with a chrome-headed rod.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as goats emissary of setting up increased tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right.
"This is a barrier to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think that way in my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and of paralyzing shyness.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
Last year, the university voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students met with the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I found out that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasms towards the Tory students, but also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy regarding striking miners, privatization and government opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa were engraved in the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victimized was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, was easily overwhelming.
“Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes during your free time - if you're not too busy making friends," he said.
I went back to my room, unconsoled.
During dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a slight blow on my shoulder.
He was a second year student of English, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's how it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me already, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory young people claim to be Labourists.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that Mrs. Thatcher said.
This scheme failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students resumed the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They beat each other, aren’t they?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I only have been able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and renounce my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who was teaching at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Thatcher's foreign policy advisor and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You will not be happy here,” he said.
I started shuttleing from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded family and city friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was unbeliever.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But this is the best place in the world,” he said patheticly.
They wouldn't do that, not in the dreaming town.
Even my communist friends had impeccable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to taste you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During a workshop conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Redening inwardly of shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old crazy".
The rest was short-lived.
It was my father who squeezed the last nail in my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed stuck in my room, and after five minutes, my prosecutors gave up.
When they left, I paid my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a wet, mournishard chicken.
However, no 18-year-old should be subjected to such bullying in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but also enjoys an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian tailor.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worth hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturier recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-end models created for his sewing house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the heart of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories like the trophies of his social rise: from the modest tailor of the town of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette slices on your beautiful carpet like some pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to her Gstaad cottage," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of past-time beauty like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the tailor.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Square in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concluded.
Parade of nobility lineage
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves well-raised people with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamour podium sixty meters wide that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must scroll on the podium to admire a "public" of dream wearing Valentino's main creations, such as the tailor Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that was in Vita.
Among this audience of models are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Tailor in 2006
Many of her clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It’s a gift he gave me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the tailor’s muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty," said Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashionable Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses.
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying skirt, a draped bustier and a necklace to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodriguez d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timelessness,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg retains the couturier's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, she is also the set of memories she carries."
The "King" of Fashion
The big final of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn at her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier calls it his seams) to make this ivory silk dress with pearl inlays, twelve different kinds of laces and a four and a half meter sleeve.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of clients of the high society."
Obscured for years by the "know-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of her clients.
"His refinement, calmness, neat and perfect appearance have always jumped into my eyes," Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
“He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him.”
If it's a princess who says it...
The toughest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gas emanating from the earth's entrails solidifies at contact with air.
After harvesting large sulfur rocks, which weigh almost 70 kilos in total, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 meters, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle-look, keeping the balance and measuring their footsteps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a wrong step could cost their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for every kilo of sulfur extracted.
Once upstairs, there is a path between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and bearing the heavy baskets painfully, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company has installed a little lower at 1,850 meters above sea level.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it at 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As we carry about 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what it would earn in the fields.
“The income of miners is very high here, where the harvest of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the bearer who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned close to her family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have married them to l'Islam.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah Ljen, but sulfur has already started to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work for another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Damaged by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wooden mass with other wearers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulfur does not stop sprouting at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs and does not supply any equipment to carriers who work on their behalf and are paid to weight.
Furthermore, they also do not touch one of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) of extra charge per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for beasts, not humans,” said Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 pounds, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his three sons, aged 10 to 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious illnesses... to which obviously their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weights.
Balancing the basket on his back, 53-year-old Unainik can only load 50 pounds.
Every day, he and his companions extracted 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transported to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unainik said, opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but perpetual misery from generation to generation is one of the most difficult jobs in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore searches for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans throw responsibility for this absence of children on career, stress and the cost of access to property.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these lyrics come from an advertisement for mint pills, but despite that, or perhaps thanks to that, the video spread like a dust trail on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polichinella in the drawer" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency that originated the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing pheromones perfumes or organizing speed dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we said to ourselves: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song of it?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it found itself above 2, considered the renewal rate was in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policies at the National Population Division, says this is due to “better education” and “a broader choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the constitution of a family,” she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, websites abound with barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of getting wages down and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore saw its worst electoral outcomes last year since independence.
Since the elections, they have been trying to fix the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax income, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate company EL Developers, says that its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger housing.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If so long these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the center's financial district, it would seem that they won't have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people put it back to later,” says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
“But for me, it’s important to have my money and my time,” another 20-year-old declares.
Men and women mention their careers, stress, and the cost of access to property and education as reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for those under the age of 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico surveyed five young boys, aged 10 to 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they combined the term "something very personal" with "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
“I’m not going to reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” Jorge, 10, says, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been holding an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not everyone,” he said.
On FB, I post some nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who would be foolish," he said.
The boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are of the family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I'm simply posting them," he added.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to remote relatives or friends quickly,” he says.
He claims he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust someone who would recommend him a stranger.
The case of José, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter he admits he does not know 20 of the people registered on his friends list.
“It doesn’t worry me because we have something in common, music for example,” he said.
According to the boy, no one made any advances or asked for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account," he said.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyber harassment are not strange to the young boy.
One of my friends was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just passed it on a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I was angry or angry.
"Even if I know it's cyber harassment," he said.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a Licensee in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,” she said.
Porras reports that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master’s degree in pedagogy from the University of Yale and author of the book “Digital Natives and Immigrants”, uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who must teach them there, while we are ourselves learning,” she says.
He added that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or tell at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective, whereas what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents privacy is to use questions that make them think.
“Their saying not to do so doesn’t help,” she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you like if they post a picture of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, do everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Without the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks,” she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and education counselor, states that it is essential for parents to read the conditions of use of social networks consciously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that they should not talk to foreigners.
UNASUR Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven present presidents.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the closure of the summit, and then claimed that it would be published from time to time on the website of the Peruvian government.
When questioned on the text, they reported that the content of the text had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private, restricted audio session" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulated among the journalists was given by press officials from some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
In October, Peru hosted the 3rd South America Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested by the press, it did not broadcast the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it is possible to verify that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the obtaining of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment by the Court of The Hague ruling a different border between the two countries.
Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ’s decision to hear both sides’ pleas in the Lima trial against Santiago that begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are holding today before this international court,” President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of international controversies, treaties and courts,” Piñera said in a statement.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it agreed to submit to the decisions of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered seriously erroneous.
The summit took place without the presence of Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the appointment.
Host President Ollanta Humala was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The mandatary read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines of 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the Unasur would make "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be put in place to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to drugs, low-cost internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and envision a better future for our people,” concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were concerned with Peru and were on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will enable its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In that sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We are going to revise all these pathways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with this country,” he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the takeover of power of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru assumes the pro temporary presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” said Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "were killed each other during World War II" and during other conflicts, "but they were now almost a homeland."
In that sense, he advocated the plan to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
"Free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador was in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise themselves, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa says he does not regret his decision because he himself did not betray his principles, but on the contrary he respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were grounded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticized Swedish justice who demanded that he undergo interrogation on his territory regarding a alleged sexual offence while "Swedish legislation allows this to be done by videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk of Assange's mental and physical health deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“It affects anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa notes that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe-conduit that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and he stresses that he has had discussions in London to find a solution to the lockdown.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we are not using this word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings with different European bodies,” he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain gave the safe-conduct from tomorrow, it would be over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation permits, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa reaffirmed himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he did not tolerate was “the mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists at the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he welcomed the fact that it was not such journalists “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador” and, rather than putting forward his re-election, “he would deepen the revolution to continue the way and trace the right path.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur until at least next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "this destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Moreover, the President of Ecuador considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague as "perfectly relevant", which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to move forward together.
We need to solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the correct settlement of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said it is "benefitful for Latin America to seize international proceedings if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it is."
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to striking for a third consecutive term, he noted that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
“My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will.
“It’s my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a recurrence of President Chávez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which concluded with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed the result of the test: HIV-positive.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid him from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to find out about him and his harshness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he ended up in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were a lot of doubts, little treatment choices, and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was voiceless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes as reference that this scientific information was validated in this year in April.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of survival years and quality of life rates depended on the level of immune system affected patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who did not consume up to 30 years of drugs:
Simply speaking, it means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnosis at age 25, “as long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age,” the scientist said.
In order to put this progress back in its context, it should be noted that Mexicans' life expectancy is now an average of 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS-deceased people has increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the nationally-reported patients have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I think the problem is not with access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
For the last 12 years at least, we have never missed any medications, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make early diagnosis and, for this, to offer screening tests massively, to all people who request it.”
Specialists and members of the Jalisco State Council for AIDS Prevention (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite her young age, he was already a carryer of AIDS and suffered from a carryer of AIDS.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better that I go out three times a week,” they say, “It’s not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To date, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active, but co-responsible sex life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with Milenio JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Let them do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better they will, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of a hundred, it's very good, but it results, that even today, some do not have access to the condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear, the journalist assures.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold at the counter, but that they be found in the distributors of public toilets and in the places that young people frequent.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them for the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied when he was asked if there would be a condom distribution within his administration.
“It’s not how sexuality works, the best thing is to provide condoms to people already sexually active,” he said.
The numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th state in the country in number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of contamination occurs by sexual means, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal means.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for each recorded case there are 4 or 5 people who don’t know about it.
A judgment ratified in appeal by a U.S. court ignores the debt restructuring of the Vitro Group through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a detrimental precedent for all national companies with ramifications in the neighboring country and with solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the survival procedures of companies authorized by Mexican law are not valid in the country with the star flag, in contrast to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment delivered on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the North Texas District Bankruptcy Court leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to refer to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case reports that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, headquartered in New Orleans, claims that the main proceedings are formalized trade bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first item would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring would not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws acknowledge this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Failures had guaranteed debt.
Moreover, what is certain is that since there were still the votes of the subsidiaries, in all ways the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is, the "back-to-back" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote was 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has encountered since 2008 without stopping the serious economic crisis facing the United States, replacing costs to the country.
For now, the company of the González Sada family will appeal to the same appeal court that the vote take place in its entirety, that is to say with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance appeal will claim non-prosperity and require the review of the trial by a higher instance, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of amicus curiae (“friend of the Court”) detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this would free him from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as clause 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Furthermore, it notes that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules established for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two parts of the carambling: they assault Vitro and they assault the country.
General balance sheet
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society's trade unions against the company's former boss, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Aviation Pilots' Union Association has already encountered problems.
The proceeding, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal claim against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has systematically denied that it has provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the F/589 trust of the bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds were allegedly used for the purchase of shares of the Hotel Professional Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
They Siege the Dragon Mart
Gathered this weekend at an amphitheatre at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad opposition front at the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a dwelling area for the employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the Southeast area in order to oppose the monumental project, which is partly located on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
The ACTA is dead
The government has highlighted a requirement from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already from ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was seen as an infringement of freedom of expression on social media.
Homex Long-term

Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball globe-trotter "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have such a great knowledge of the history of local basketball as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him in the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether it was as a lower league player, basketball national team player, manager and head of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the faith.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was chairman of the BSN, managing director of the national team and chairman of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball is my whole life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs that recall his out-of-the-art itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those that remind him of his time as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s until 1982, after spending 15 years as a co-manager or manager of the team.
“These were my best years, the ones I’ve enjoyed the most because I’ve had the chance to take part in eight Vaqueros championships starting in 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
It has been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, told me, "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters long.
Do you want him?"
That’s how Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico, started.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember he was saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He rejoiced in the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's charges in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and we should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn’t made us play the last game again, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and put a scratch on the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend the world of 90 because of a problem.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Mar del Plata Pan American Games, we won the gold against all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His international tournament statistics are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín did.
And that without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
What is your greatest success in the Federation?
Having been part of the national team's most glorious time between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What have you left to do?
There are things I would have wished to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and only compete with teams from other corners of the island in national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field personnel and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by the leading role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a scrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of Dallas, died Friday night of cancer complications, according to a family statement sent to The Associate Press for Warner Bros., production house of Dallas.
“Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on that Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original and subsequent series, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, his press attorney, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
“He was an exceptional person and he lived life fully,” Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis with Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had acknowledged having drunk a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman made himself known on television as an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also played in two comedies that stayed shortly on the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are well-received roles by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their loved ones was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who tried to interne his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Ci-Git the Honest Citizen J.R. Ewing."
Here's the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a “immense man, both on the small screen and in life.”
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have been lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is underway, the channel informed.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT have announced how Hagman's death will be included in the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who became famous with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the stages of New York theatres in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he entitled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
“I advise them, I give them back confidence, I go with them when they come for surgery and then,” he says in 1996.
I’m trying to offer them some comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a while, but it’s going to be okay.”
He was also an anti-tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course about the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
This semester, when Religion Professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a lesson on the end of the world, he knew he was throwing an irresistible hook there: the end of the Mayan calendar "big count" on December 21, which many refer to as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal gap that some have nicknamed “the Armageddon of Debt,” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where late-time Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would be triggered.
“I didn’t realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to give lessons on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker gives the class "Media, Culture and End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We are analyzing this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the class again, in case the world doesn’t disappear,” Professor Restall said.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed the day before the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The classes proved quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his high-level student course, composed of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or absence of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of Psychology and Nursing, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a class teaching this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students surveyed, let alone a teacher, told us to believe in the end date of the world on December 21.
"Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we have discredited it," says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple, from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I acknowledge that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a rise in these speculations.
“In other parts of the globe, people don’t think about that,” he said.
This is mostly from the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew we were teaching here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21st, “people will immediately start thinking about the next date” or philosophy that December 21st marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many have told us that they plan to go to "the end of the world" holidays.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh about them together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
