The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "conditorey".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the SDG in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once “knocked off” members of the new council from the ČSSD, as it masters the notorious slang that has naturalized in recent years, in which today’s coalition partners in Prague were on the chest.
The codified vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era by Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils in terms of which these new terms tap somewhat in the dark.
At least they say that.
“Who is Voldemort?”
"I don't know."
"I am more likely to be a novice in Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, responded to the test of the "Paten-Wordschatz".
But Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "gold hole".
"That's the only expression of those you're introducing to me here, I'm using from time to time."
“Otherwise I don’t think much of slang.”
From the vocabulary published by the journal Aktuálně.cz in June before the ODS electoral congress this year, the editorial team picked out six terms, especially those notably related to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest Prague golf hole", "going to the pastry shop", "bulk snacks", "betrayal of the capital" and "bleach".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague's school system - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
“I don’t care about these things and how the Democrats talk to each other, I don’t judge them.”
“It’s important to me how we understand each other in our programs,” he said.
As already suggested, Lukáš Kaucký in the above-mentioned headline allegedly did not realize that the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, was spoken.
The term "Voldemort" means Kaucky nothing at all and the only term he found correctly during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to safety: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm probably going to have to take a language course."
The "golhole" is then correctly deciphered as tunnel Blanka not only by Matador Karel Březina but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where this figure can be found and thus also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that's going to some Prague catering company," Plachý is quite close to the solution of the puzzle, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he asserted that he had rather acquired this knowledge from the newspaper than that this vocabulary would be his own.
To judge the test participants, there seems to be no similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
“I asked my colleagues too, but obviously there’s really not something like that with us.”
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague CSSD Petr Hulínský - called by his party fellow salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and look there - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party's fellow "grandfather" or less friendly to the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention before the elections through machinations in party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only one that the Social Democrats allow in the intra-party language use.
Hulínský wouldn't like to be called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of Prague's chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubber Knob Rights" is allegedly related to the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped as witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they don't find work - for example, for health reasons, they're single and have no children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot be dangerous to the rest of the village.
“Men are rarely affected by this fate.”
“Even young and healthy women keep this spared as they help work and give birth to children,” a sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, he issued a brochure that is meant to stop "witch persecution".
But the thing has a hook.
“More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read,” the newspaper pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But the accusation of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured over her with oil and simply lit her on.
The incident was reported, among other things, by the BBC server.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter had only been a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil is flaming, which is used for ritual anointments.
And that after the group tried to "draw out" a "evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" supports people here regardless of their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "Friends of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to disarm the witch hunt, last year the Gambian president himself mixed well.
“President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt’s death, as they allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now attempt to kill the president himself by black magic.”
“He called for help shamans from near-Guinea who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the President’s bodyguard, violently kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the President’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, imprisoned people were forced to drink an absud of plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay at the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant from Bakala: He is heating in the oven - still paying higher rent
An elderly subordinate man has just left the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a box with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is just serving a prison sentence.
All three were raised in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" just the rent.
Instead of 3500 crown monthly rental, the son is expected to raffle next year for a 2 bedroom apartment with second category kitchen 4100 crowns.
"And there's not even flowing warm water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal furnace," he angryly taps on the son's new rental contract, to whose signing he has an authority.
"But what - I signed," he explains half confused and half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental terms as “incorrect and immoral,” advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when they intend to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just waves.
“One says this, the other says this,” he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region becomes a major "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay a market-appropriate rent.
Actuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "laboratory" in person.
The RPG waiting space in Havířov is one out of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o’clock in the morning this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and with it a calling device.
"Lease 2011", a special touch screen lights up on the touch screen.
Shortly tapped and the device already spits out a number ticket.
We have barely deciphered the number "157" and already pips it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
Starting in mid-November in the Ostrava region, the cuverts with the new rental contracts will float into the mailboxes for most tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letters.
The special switch for the new rentals in the customer center is open since November 18th.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch reply hesitant after a moment as the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala’s former mine workers’ apartments are a brisant issue.
Prior to the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, had taken this topic quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
“Twenty years I want a new floor from them.”
"Not even besch. They could replace toilet glasses," the man mentioned at the beginning gets air.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly standing at the counter to see if they really receive the promised rental discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new rental agreement by December 15 will also be able to enjoy a half-reduced February rental.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded by demands.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent were here in 2011 because of the rental," the officers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall panels where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
“This is not to be a threat, but to be understood as information on the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure,” RPG said on its websites.
"Here no one is going to court," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the customer center gives her at least partially right.
“I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I get the money for a court dispute,” he says.
Then the employee becomes uncertain.
"Let's see."
“Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media not to sign and so the people are still waiting,” she says.
Regulated rent ends mostly in the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is, in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in housing in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rents earned, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red bright information appears again and again.
"The rental increases of 15% and less in 2011 affect 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter per month," reads on the LCD monitor.
Only for 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, rent increases by 38 percent.
“In these cases, it is about increasing extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square meter,” RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not jump up the rents, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another commitment: All revenues from the rent increase (see chart) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the thermal insulation.
But - priority is to benefit those who sign the rental increase agreements.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with all that includes: colorful walls, creative furniture, lots of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose workshops comes a whole series of well-known Brno buildings, counted from the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the premises for its company mini garden.
In wise prospects, because most of his 90 employees are in the baby boom age and the company is committed to ensuring that the projectors return to their workplace as quickly as possible.
Along with the ability to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of its social program.
Civil engineers and architects have easier to put their demanding profession and child care under a hat.
The mini kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini kindergarten is financed through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidy of CZK 2.8 million) the necessary facilities and equipment were obtained and for the duration of 2 years are provided for qualified personnel and operations.
After the funding has been exhausted (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini kindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company providing active assistance in the processing of the application.
The children care full-day qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can attend children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but several children alternate each other's day.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is about individual education and care, the program content in the mini kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
The children are not only playing here, they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus eliminate the stress of late picking up the children from a remote kindergarten.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also developing here.
Arch.Design thus ranked among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and encourage their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric ax, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are ripped fish piles.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic shapes was nicknamed "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splitters and mosaics, the façades reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dream lines, tender colours and textures that remind nature and living beings.
Only with a closer look can you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the shine of the colours.
The same swinging lines and swallowed shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, ornamental elements of doors, even eye holes and bars.
The Batlló house in the Eixample neighborhood on the bustling shopping street Passeig de Gràcia No. 43 was built by the renovation of a house from 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of an entirely new building, but ultimately he agreed with Gaudí’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
The rental house Casa Batlló, however, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the reality owner’s representative apartment and the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other artists and artists also collaborated on the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus, Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí’s house Casa Milá in the Park Güell, which also includes other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given the nickname "Knochenhaus" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "swinging house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But also other sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system unique to the time with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
Somewhat bizarre is her 45-degree inclination.
During his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be stuck by them.
Before the construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, the city fathers were so terrified by the result that they demanded remedy.
The Councillors also encountered, among other things, that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no more changes, quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the request of the district in this regard, Josep Batlló submitted an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was granted to him promptly.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a corporate lounge, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The entire six-story building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion removed all right angles and straight lines and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of interconnecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and thus a larger society could conveniently chat without having to give up some intimacy during more confidential conversations.
The house received a fairly unusual roof and two more floors by Gaudí’s renovation in addition to a new facade.
Impressive is also Gaudí’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courts.
The game of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply used the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors that, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
The House Casa Batlló, which was listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can now be visited by anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is made open to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this is a rather profitable business, the visits were retained, and they were also extended to further common and attic rooms, including the rooftop terrace.
The price for visiting the monument, however, is not a cardboard piece, it is 16.50 euros, students, retirees, groups and tourist card holders receive 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance rates for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, try to make friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rod? Women have other wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying area - so mattress and rust make the good bed.
These must, however, harmoniously complement each other in order to meet the desires of the specific user.
Many things play a role in choosing - the weight, the size, the health condition and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend home where it is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited as they take a lot longer to "be warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned around regularly.
In fact, if they do not have enough ventilation ducts in the core and they lie on a solid plate, moisture is stabbed: it is therefore not excluded that mold forms underneath it.
In the election, of course, it also plays a role in what you are accustomed to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
“Well, all the ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL have complained to me that they can’t sleep right here.”
"For their shoulders, heels and hips they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, to sugar sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and skin poorly," explains Sylva Hadamczikova, who specializes in upholstery furniture.
That’s why I already purchased many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers, these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, as such mattresses offer, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily need to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of Visco foam.
This “miracle” actually works very simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it sticks to the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, at night you don’t roll around like after a heavy battle.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound burn).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still calculate the length of the foot soles to the body height, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are 180 cm tall, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm lying width, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
For the sake of comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following thumb rule applies for the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the master of the upholstery and space equipment, who has been devoted to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for years.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are equal.
Otherwise there is nothing left but to assemble the rust at different heights and this is long ago not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm tall, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be removed from the molding layer and the fine cushion.
"With your hand or while sitting you can't feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and base like combined Siam twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already going on today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) screen after five to seven years.
This is also why professionals reject advertising slogans, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years for mattresses, even lifetime warranty.
Everything has her if and yet.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: for mattresses of 120 or 140 cm wide, you should not be afraid of the hygiene of washable, detachable covers, yet it is advisable to use a mattress saver, which can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually made with a full-zip zip, so that after opening you get two halves (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often mutes like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do you have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are no already in it) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring cores and fine cushions.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable latch bars with 14 to 18 spring bars (lamellae), with a larger number of latch bars, i.e. 28 or more spring bars, with lordose support in the lumbar vertebral area and the possibility to regulate the latch hardness.
Adjustable blade rods do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special attachment of the spring bars, which allows the spring bars to be pressed or even angled in such a way that they enable the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in point.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area on "men's mattresses".
Ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, dot-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or rust with dot-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion suspension are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, thereby reducing the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and filling) pillow to the right mattress and proper rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here is also a thumb rule: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow seems to be liked by Scandinavians, for example.
In the side position, the pillow (along with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have in common with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
Also for mattresses, the new magical word is called "bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used in the production of polyurethane foams – for example, castor and soybean oils.
Soybeans are probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio means for mattresses that their core is made of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vasíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance while sleeping.
There is also a difference between man and woman.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb heat and cool the body, the covers have a "warming" effect for women.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes comfortably warm when sleeping.
What about today’s favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to pack 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered as medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was given this advantage.
You can see, saving on the mattress and rust is not that easy.
Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
Thus, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with the Visco Foam Memory for CZK 11,990.
The second one is available for free.
It was the Tempur material that introduced the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at nearly cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were designed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at launches.
Tempur becomes soft at heat, in a cool environment it in turn solidifies.
Thus, it perfectly adapts to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burns, but also generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to keep the kids under control
The fear of their own children is growing, so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search for cars, is as well able to locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases as recently in the traceless disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about as large as a cigarette box, but it is not likely to be larger than a wristwatch soon.
Many people have turned the case of the disappeared Anička into fear and fright, thus looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairment of their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying at all, but rather an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices in the Czech market.
“I admit that there can be misuse of such equipment in individual cases, for example if you put it in someone’s pocket without them knowing it, but we haven’t had to record such a case so far.”
“Most customers really buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn’t like to wear such a thing, it simply gets rid of it.
“Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
"Initially, the cell phones raised great expectations from parents, but they can be turned off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Bočková.
In their view, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with him to locate it."
"Today it's the cell phone."
“If such surveillance devices were to find wider use, they would also look for it, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising.”
“In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, locating services for both automobiles and individuals can help the existence of such a device even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted to report the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available."
"In more expensive devices, even an inclination meter is integrated, that is, if you fall and remain unmoving, the device immediately sends a warning, stating the position," says Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide smart mobile phones with navigation, you only need to play a special software.
The problem with current tracking devices is that it is either about devices in a box size that resemble trailers or smaller cell phones.
There is always a risk of losing it.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are being tested today.
"This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or tracking device.
"Or he will notice this until after a certain time, which gives the police a time lead," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in vehicle location.
In other words, the combination of locating function using the GPS system (just as with the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many cords of ignition that you could wrap up all the Czech Republic but only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords, which are being ignited with explosives.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have disposed of for 225 years.
The problem is only the shelf life of the ignition cords - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the stock company STV Group, a.s. for 40 million lappian crowns.
In his reasoning for the purchase of this enormous quantity of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES addressed it, this statement shows that the entire army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be justified halfway.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies, that for the training of each new professional soldier, two meters of ignition cord is completely sufficient, then the army has created a soothing stock for the 225 years mentioned above by these new purchases - even from the point of view of the increased need of the pioneering and special units.
Soldiers of the Quick Response Brigade recently complained to Minister of Defense Vondra that they almost no longer had cartridges for handguns, so shooting exercises are severely restricted due to the lack of resources.
Not to mention the shortage of underpants.
“I don’t understand why they’re buying such lots of cords from us.”
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
“For us, the army is a good customer that we as a merchant want to meet as far as possible,” says sales manager of STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition cord by saying that the army would have covered itself with this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians only two years.
“With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible,” one of them admits, but wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the lifetime of use, all ammunition must be thoroughly tested to see if it is still reliable and does not jeopardize the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument by the Ministry of Defense is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pejšek told us of the position of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defense.
For a comparison, the annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnicians liquidating ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet brotherly army has barely exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only the amounts of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of the use life.
Already due to the safety of the pyrotechnicians, in addition, the possibility of flexible purchases is kept open to more modern and thus also reliable ignition cords.
The Ministry of Defence has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovakian People’s Army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES addressed, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers old ignition cords that they bought so "cheaply" today.
To this day I have the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition.
The winning placement in the "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Winner of the last year's "Little Entrepreneur of the Year" competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success looks like a film scene.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he realized that Liberec lacks good accommodation at reasonable prices.
From the savings of his vacation work abroad and with the aid of a bank loan, he acquired a faulty house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a college student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
“The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it,” says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profit in the house, which he then step by step converted to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another top-class hotel was added.
“We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotel franchise have already registered,” says the entrepreneur number one last year.
“Great share of this license sale to operate hotels was just the victory in the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ competition,” says Pytloun.
The victory has given him greater renown and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
“People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did quite well,” he recalls.
I really recommend to everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don’t have to win right away, every vision is good.
He says that to this day he benefits from contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have come at all.
“With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I have regular business relationships to this day.”
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success also reflects a little on each of his employees.
And there he is at the seventy.
“I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition.”
I really see this not just as a personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name is only a little in the forefront," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his aspiration, Farmet has the worst behind him.
Last year, Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet, received the award for the first rank of the Vodafone Companies competition of the year.
At the time, the jury recognized the efforts he used to stamp out of the small toolmaking company in Česká Skalice, a company that made hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this appreciation not only encourages me, but also all my employees and has strengthened our self-confidence in the struggle with the competition,” says the previous year’s winner.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history, the effort was to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop to lease as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, left his career in the company in which he was employed until then, and founded his own company for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs with a few comrades of his father.
Shortly afterwards, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success of the competition mentioned and its medialization that it became aware of the non-specialist public.
“Not only have our customers perceived the Farmet brand more intensely, but our foreign partners have also begun to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country,” says Karel Žďárský.
However, last year at Farmet was not only in the sign of victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of toolmaking products.
The crisis, which at the time was even less shaking citizens, but above all companies, was at its peak – many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we couldn’t escape this situation either.”
"Revenues decreased by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even seek dismissals," explains Karel Žďárský
A viable company must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to manage the situation and keep the company in black figures, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to make any reductions in investments in research and development.
"We built a research and training center from the grant, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won top prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything is evidence that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner much joy in the victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
An opinion survey that clears up with nonsense regulations
The opinion poll about the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsense regulations have already managed to get out of the world.
As the doubtful winner of the next year's "Absurdity of the Year" opinion poll, the duty to create documents on authorities that are available online advanced.
For example, more than one-third of not entirely four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official could have accessed it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion survey, this is changing.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require excerpts from the trade register for checks on social security payers in the future," said ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to look at all regulations and orders, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to remove the nonsense.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurial competition hosted by the tsch. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoys increasing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people were involved in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business.
"When it comes to the number of income tax forms, for example, we take a leading position in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized companies and tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurship has been the goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of business conditions, compared to the previous year.
The competition Absurdity of the Year was proclaimed for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of the competition.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. The organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and lets the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year’s opinion survey, more than a hundred, more precisely 105, meaningless regulations and orders were reported.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the competition’s nominated “finalists” are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and highways must pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must present every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square is part of an event, in which regularly participate personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small and medium-sized companies and tradesmen of the Republic, as well as Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic, were at the height of the competition.
“Where the state throws entrepreneurs between their legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my goal is to remove at least thirty paragraphs each year, which today still unnecessarily make entrepreneurs more difficult to undertake,” said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to create nonsense orders out of the world have an effect.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the duty imposed on the entrepreneurs to report to the commercial officer at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention of wanting to drive to an exhibition stand or kirmes.
This obligation was repealed by virtue of an amendment to the Commercial Law.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report employees' trips to the Employment Office for up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all the good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two person scales in the conversation room was chosen.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator duty was dropped.
A new category acknowledges socially responsible companies
Assessment criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the Competition of the Business Newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair undertaking.
“We want to support those companies that are aware of the impact of their entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of Vodafon, who proclaims and guarantees this competition, as well as the “Rebel of the Year” competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafon Competition Company of the Year, companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and puts on enough material for a self-employed article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about people with disabilities, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory in Poděbrady also takes exemplary care of its health-disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which, among other things, introduced a smooth and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, and this without a proportionate reduction in wage.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports citizen initiatives in their surroundings and works on environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimize the impact of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment,” explains Miluše Ryznarová, Managing Director.
In turn, the responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is concerned with the health of its employees and that’s why it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, also promotes home work with its employees and uses cartering services offered by a local protected workshop.
“In addition, we support the foundation ‘People in Need’, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community,” says Ondřej Suchý, the company’s representative.
Last but not least, it is worth mentioning the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their employees' pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
"We make contributions to our employees for food, work, skills and holidays," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Slesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the Year were automatically registered all district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the 'Responsible Company of the Year' competition, but in the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition they were not disqualified."
“Separate registration for this competition alone is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition Company of the Year,” explains Karel Goldman of the hosting agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have taken arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter allegedly attempted to manipulate a public competition currently taking place to settle claims for restitution in such a way that the plots offered in the competition belonged to a specific interested party.
Luboš G. is said to have paid half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police persecute a person in a public competition for the crime of fraudulent actions," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner Prosecutor's Office of the newspaper "Právo", not giving them any further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was dismissed from the police.
How he could manipulate public competition can only be speculated about it given the scarce official information.
The spokeswoman of the Ground Fund Lubomír Černá raised Právo’s question in this regard that the police had actually taken arrests at the Pilsner subsidiary of the Ground Fund during a public competition.
“It was about a client and not one of our employees,” she said.
According to the public competition, Mrs Černá had the correct designation "invitation to tender claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the proposed land.
"These persons offer, within the framework of the request, a higher value of their entitlements to be paid by the transfer than the value of the land proclaimed."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, then the ground fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," the fund spokeswoman explains.
Luboš G. obviously had information available on who had applied for the request and, since he himself was a legitimate person, because he had purchased a number of claims for restitution, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. has had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
Thus, he also played a role in the cause of the former head of the ground fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for exposing land in replacement restitutions to which location decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At the time, Luboš G. also purchased land from the Ground Fund, for example, intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely at the point where the construction of the access magistrales to the Borské pole commercial area was planned.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
The town hall had to make small contributions at the time in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the land.
Household housing costs rise by a few hundred a month
As of January, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher fees for water and wastewater and for district heating and in some places rents will also grow.
As of January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns more out of the wallet monthly than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent or more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places it will also expensive distance heat supplies.
The electricity reduction alone costs housing households a few hundred crowns more each year.
High power prices were lowered by all major suppliers, thus the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic plants.
Gas will only be slightly more expensive, but this is precisely when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here too, you can expect a few hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger places plan to increase prices.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay more than 50 crowns per month from January onwards, and more than 1000 crowns per year will have to pay more families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague are threatened by 9 percent higher fees for water and sewage in case the city increases its infrastructure rental.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage fees are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, in which the so-called rental regulation will be dropped from January onwards.
For example, housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
Those who disagree with this rental increase, the company wants to bring them to court.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just looks too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally a good whisky stolen from the father's bar.
These are the drinks that drinking drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen need to be treated the most urgently.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cat repeatedly in the hospital.
This results from the experience of physicians who face similar cases in the reception of the children’s departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief physician of the children's department at the Hořovice Medical Hospital.
"Whisky, if it manages to steal a bottle from the house bar from the father, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
“Wodka has the advantage that you can mix it with juice, then it doesn’t smell so strongly,” the chief doctor explains.
The spokeswoman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"The most common is about Fernet or Rum."
“That’s the trend of alcohol today, especially in primary schools.”
"Sometimes it was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to Chief Doctor Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital hospital are no longer an exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of the Hospital Motol, where the ambulances delivered drunk students from near and far.
“A girl had to be hospitalized four times.”
"Her career began at the age of 12 when she first received 3.5 million alcohol in her blood and was added in combination with 'ecstasy'," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice at some dance party."
“The interesting thing about it was that it didn’t seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn’t come home for 48 hours,” the chief doctor wonders.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when initiating with their own offspring that is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, it is not possible for children to be truly dependent in the true sense of the word.
“Alcoholism is to be understood as a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all the associated phenomena, and this is not the case with these children.”
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is mostly characteristic,” explains Chief Doctor Pelikán.
According to Motol Hospital spokeswoman, Ms Jurinová, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local Department of Child and Youth Medicine by mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by the parents or, if necessary, by the police will not be registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of alcohol in the school bench, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes on which one can rely 100%: Walpurgis Night, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad testimony or for joy in the holidays."
"In the Walpurgis Night, I have also experienced seven drunk children at once in the admission," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better than a child who is only struggling with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The next morning headaches, resulting from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be expelled in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the body.
"They are clearly better at it, because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood without hurting anything anywhere."
“They’re just a little confused about where they are,” admits Dr. Pelikán, at least sometimes spoiling the patient’s good mood by listing the costs they will cost treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and like to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"I used it as an educational means when I told the kids directly on the visit, what cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they will have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such feast," added Dr. Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance funds do not resort to regression procedures to ask the parents for the costs necessary to heal the drunk children.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five exchanged by the Czech Ministry of Defense for the transport aircraft Casa C-295M flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have been in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were only seen at maneuvers or flight shows.
The two-seater version L-159T1 was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are one-seat L-159.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over them last week.
When the aircraft are physically dispatched from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
The one-seat fighter L-159, in turn, was separated from long-term-stored aircraft without further deposits and investments from the department.
"The dual-seat L-159T1 has been exchanged in current condition and appearance," Pejšek told the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to run without two-seat fighter aircraft, as the Defense Ministry signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four superfluous L-159s to the two-seat version.
The army took over a new plane in July and the second will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to enforcing the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the buyer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are to be used to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the customer's responsibility how he realizes the matter," said Pejšek.
The business newspaper (HN) previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defense did not tender for procurement at the time, but contacted EADS directly.
The then Defense Office argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159s abroad.
The Czech army purchased Aero 72 aircraft, of which it only used 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft is likely to have a judicial consequence.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice, which is why it should have chosen the aircraft on the basis of an all-European tender and not on the basis of a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer pointing finger than a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
This is due to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty,” said the study’s co-author, Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick Cancer Research Institute.
The finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health stresses, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the right hand finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the likelihood of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of men whose ring and pointing fingers were equal.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to sixty percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already formed in the prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer pointing finger.
Earlier research has shown that just testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK that this study was fleetingly known to him, but he does not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and walkways is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicemen were on axis in many places all night.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of trucks and passenger cars and also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was said by Novinky.CZ, the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At Kilometer 91, a truck crashed, at Kilometer 93, two trucks collided, and there were injuries in this accident.
There are also a few cars in the road pit.
There are also problems at kilometers 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Here too, two trucks collided.
The drivers should leave right behind Brno at kilometer 190 or over Brno and climb at kilometer 182 at the town of Kývalka.
Indeed, there are kilometers of traffic jams.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 and that right at the arrival to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover of several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Auto colonies are formed in the city of Prosek, for example, the road Štěrboholská is completely blocked.
The safest means of transportation is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railway and the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snowfall.
For example, there are problems on the Prague – Kralupy route or also Prague – Beroun.
Travelers should be informed about the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně is closed from Wednesday 11am at night until 5am.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
In the vicinity of Vyškov, three side roads are completely untravelable, in the vicinity of Brno snowfalls occur at times and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Vyškov.
There are still three roads completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, you will have to use snow milling to remove snow.
When they are returned, we can’t estimate until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is needed in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which can only be scattered with inert spreaders for reasons of nature conservation, there is a snow cover of up to five centimeters thick, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, new snow fell from two to ten centimeters, mostly in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Slesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon".
American troops have used a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, so far known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict with the Taliban and postpone the power ratio in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super accurate gun.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a target accuracy of only a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre projectiles designed for this rifle containing high explosive explosives function practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed so that they can explode at any point in their ballistic path not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the pit.
It is usually not protected from the top, so the murderous steel split rain from the top can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically goes this way: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an accurate targeting point, after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he just needs to press.
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
"When you push down, the gun loads up and shoots the shot down to the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two, or three meters.
400 jobs moved
The Fujitsu Group moves its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group is moving its headquarters in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant, specializing in computers and their maintenance, announced Wednesday, in July next year, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in Frankfurt’s district Niederrad.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, there should be another 100 jobs of the group that have been distributed in the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, in addition, the large offices in the Astro Park would better meet the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had only been tenants.
The managing director Bernd Wagner said, “With Frankfurt Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
Excellent airport connections are of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The renewed move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
The Frankfurt business division Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" had been won again.
This is a “great site confession.”
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for lower wheel.
The Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The town was informed early by the management of the intention.
“Of course, we offered our help to the company,” Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have given rise.
Now it is about preventing a long vacuum in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building is cooperative."
Fujitsu’s house on Town Hall Square and the neighboring “Small Verticals” were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa town, along with the other buildings on Marienbadplatz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both due to the massive construction of the previously partly used parking spaces and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating firm Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, then connected to Siemens, acquired the homes.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt German Real Estate Opportunity Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu is the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies, for example, computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is relocating to Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name is based on its star-shaped ground plan - the Central Association of the Electrical and Electronics Industry has its headquarters, among other things.
Amazon blocks server threats against Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic depicts.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is becoming increasingly under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists have lost access to their previous American servers and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s search lists, is said to be in the UK according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced from Amazon servers."
"Free Speech in the Land of the Free," the unveiling activists told Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
The internet company Amazon had banned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic depicts to manage the high numbers of access to the documents.
Wikileaks said on Twitter, “Prima – our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had undertaken investigations, CNN reported, citing Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British Guardian reported.
“I would have wished that Amazon would take this measure earlier, given the previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks,” the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called on the platform to deny the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous, and ruthless action puts our national security at risk and jeopardizes life around the globe," the Senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help Wikileaks in its efforts to spread stolen material.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is being searched for rape by Sweden’s authorities, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is staying in Britain, the exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats in London.
“There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange.”
That is why Assange is rightly afraid of his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently reacted to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks disclosures be charged with betrayal and executed.
In Canada, a consultant to Prime Minister Stephen Harper – obviously ironic – said on television that Assange should be “killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Meanwhile, between the White House and Assange, a strike exchange burned out.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “laughful and absurd” that Assange had called for Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton to resign if she was responsible for recently-recognized espionage calls to diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website.”
The U.S. government is now testing the protection of its databases extensively.
The Deputy Director of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Action, Russell Travers, was appointed as Special Representative, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that have become necessary after Wikileaks’ disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to have the ways checked how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it wants to ensure the safety of dissidents and the most active if they are at risk through the Wikileaks release.
"We have done everything possible to get in touch with them," Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We are ready to protect them if they need to do so.”
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream pastries are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest intake and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelatiere and from the gelataio.
The gelatiere, in German somewhat ancient of the ice cream, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream from the refrigerator with a spatula, strips it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you will not pass the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice-cream university established the ice-cream machine manufacturer in 2003 so that the ice-cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest intake and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also several-day special courses on chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream shop.
Some people dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just dare to see the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents – from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years in a nervous job wants to put something of her own in.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
The key is not only good taste, but also silky smoothness and good consistency.
In his training, however, Luciano does not forget the cream head of the national and at all southern overhead: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a cock on the machine, and a pasteurized white base cream comes out, which is the basis for all milk ice cream types.
Immediately the teacher is asked with questions: Can ice cream be made only with natural fabrics without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own desire to experiment freely run?
Luciano warns of being led astray by the spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar flour from guar bean.
Of course, you can make ice cream even without a stabilizer, but it only needs to be sold within a day, otherwise it will put together, and the customer bites on a lot of ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients purchased in the fruit department or the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pasta.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you dozens of flavored additives."
“But you should just experiment.”
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white mass, which with eggs becomes a yellow cream and with cocoa powder the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now the students can go to the ice machines.
Luciano makes four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
The same experiment also undergoes fruit ice cream varieties.
More flavouring substances, more fruit puree - tasting isn't necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste more nutty if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream makes the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture will properly highlight the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice cream is a computing task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano draws a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winers thus measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make the computer easier.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical use as before.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the basic mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small failures do not fail.
The Brazilian Gustavo and his classmates are clinging to fruit puree from top to bottom as the oversized stick mixer gets out of control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s just a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Controllers in the dark
The European Food Authority, Efsa, has been immigrated by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent Institute for the Assessment of the Impact of Biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well,” Christoph Then, CEO of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been contracted with the Ilsi lobbyist association for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the Efsa testing regulations for gene plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa rules are in paragraphs the same as the Ilsi position papers and thus deceive the manuscript of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has engaged in a collision of interests.
As a result, she was a senior Efsa manager recently without any conditions or transition period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and has thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also recently revealed personal connections between the controlling EU authorities and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environmental Office as well as EU parliamentarians clear.
However, the EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
Rely on all reliable data, including industry data, as long as they are of high technical quality, a statement said.
Experts working for Efsa do not demand that they have no contact with industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the United States.
This refers to itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics – including the risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
Independent experts like Then criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempts and the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does in the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how do you find them?” he asks accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck sees this as well.
The scientist has been researching in genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is now trying more and more in Europe to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field, as in the US.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers that were not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would generally not be published.
“The industry controls security research,” says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about which, in total, about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood in front of Stuttgart train station, the Tuba on his back.
It was a demo.
It's snowing.
The story is known: in September, the excavators were pushed up and had begun to break down a large piece of the northern wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar downgrading of the station.
When it came to a construction stop, much of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim shell limestone, a soft coarse stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He secured some of the pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"You must not go away."
“A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy.”
When he sawed one, the one smelled of cigarette whale.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the pieces.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart Stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stone Empire.
The 44-year-old deals with old stones.
He bought all the ones who took part in the destruction of Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were ground into gravel or disappearing in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden man who once was a guardhouse.
Insulted and threatened him, he says, when newspapers wrote in September that he bought the remains of the northern wing from the destruction contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn’t do anything for the destruction.
And if it happens, it would be the most reasonable thing if the stones were used again.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took with them one of the 80-kilogram squares weighing on average, a unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, but some also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large trucks.
About half of them are still in the woods, the rest is already sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, housekeepers.
They came from everywhere and had pulled away what trunk and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of angle have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of herbal beds.
“In fact, this stone isn’t special,” Rongen says.
“It wouldn’t be the political component.”
He climbs in his off-road car, makes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
He studied law and cancelled biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And stone lovers.
He stored 40,000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany he collects his treasures.
He says he's the biggest old stone trader in the republic.
He's braking.
In the snow lies artfully carved sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elves sandstone, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe railway station.
And go on.
"Beautiful travertin."
The quads once belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Office, red granite from the St. Blasien Cathedral, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what trouble, what sweat.
If Rongen thinks of how the stones were previously cut by hand and moved with simple bottle trains and cattle carts, he becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal if you scratched something like that."
He has not become rich, not stone rich at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone trader today, besides, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener settled up in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the rest recycler.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save, too.
Talent fight for high potentials
There is a rainy andrang at the buffet.
16 students are pushing for salmon breads, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In some kind of ideas competition, they should, together with VW developers, simplify about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the cleverest minds, many companies are now going in close fighting and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates in the lecture rooms as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the achievements of their students, one tries to spy on the exceptional talents in practical projects and bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company promotes the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes pencils, rubber bears and cards with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig manages the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and gain experience."
"VW can simultaneously meet students, look closer at interesting candidates and think about who would be in question as an employee."
Such cooperations, says Selle, are not unusual.
It is so offensive to the students.
“Otherwise the focus was more on the technical project,” says Selle.
The fight for the new graduates will be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large crowd of applicants.
Instead, they have to acknowledge themselves and especially highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unemployed in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will grow even greater according to VDI forecasts.
For the audit and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
He organizes complex recruitment events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern carving hunt where participants must find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students will send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, the participants can look at KPMG stores and get to know the company.
Who can participate will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of the many applicants is flying to the USA.
As the high potentials at universities are stinging and stinging, the guns are growing ever larger, according to Dykta.
“We want to get out of the crowd with the race.”
"Only a simple sailing was too little for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill appears to be opened.
"We have been in contact with all the participants in a similar action last year."
“Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct couging at the campus, small and medium-sized companies are also very classical at professional trade fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
“Etwa on the Intersolar,” reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs around 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the childhood issues.
Currently, 35 jobs are published on the company’s website.
“It’s very difficult to take vacant positions right now.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give clues that you can do internships with us or write your thesis."
Expensive promotions are not used by solar specialists.
For this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“A large group can’t offer that often,” says Staff Manager Stübe.
Money has no longer played the main role in finding a job.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good elevation opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute draws up an annual top-notch list of German employers.
To this end, it ask employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Personnel manager Stübe also hopes that the placement will give him plus points among job seekers.
“I think applicants are looking especially for external reviews about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers on more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer leads over your own employees,” he says.
In the industry jargon, the internal name is employer branding, i.e. employer branding within their own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would promote their employer to friends and acquaintances alone.
“It’s like a game with gangs,” Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
On the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
The government in Washington has enacted a similar ban - and thus finally revoked its previous plans.
Even before the Atlantic coast, new drills are for now prohibited.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar announced this on Wednesday.
Trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the U.S.’s biggest environmental disaster, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents want to reduce US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever is responsible for the devastating oil plague in the Gulf has not yet been cleared.
At the heart of criticism is the British energy company BP, facing billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar repealed the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which has been criticized after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that he will close lucrative tax slumps for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the output volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than previously due to more stringent regulations.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultant company BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of the uncertainty in the industry: “Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be delayed until further - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People are living from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
“Don’t be afraid,” the eco-activist reassures the journalists: “You will still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued an attempt to light up a boy waking up to the chest in the water with the surrounding slices: in the rainbow-colored water gloss the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that under the surface are brown crude oil squads is not visible.
She used to collect shrimp here, Esther Badom tells on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the slow flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, lots of crude oil was poured out of a brushed pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the ride through the mangrove marshes through rivers, the whole extent of the devastation becomes visible.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat wobbles brown broth, whoever immerses his hand in the water pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black lakrish rods from the ground, sadly causing palm trees to hang their wedges.
Swarms of birds, as they are usual in wetlands, are chosen in vain: As soon as the outside border is silent, the former paradise spreads in the phantom calm smelling like a gas station.
“What is happening here is ecological warfare,” Celestine Akpobari says darkly: “We live in constant danger to health.”
The comparison of war is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield that has been competing for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe entered here, organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to stop production in 1993 because it became dangerous for his oil workers.
Even today, the company is refused to return to Ogoniland: While the entire delta region of the triple size of Switzerland pumps more than two million barrels of black gold daily, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable for the group.
Every few hundred meters steel frames project like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the drill holes much too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroding to the mark.
Again and again such a drilling head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil drains into water.
More than two billion litres have flowed into the Delta’s ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year the amount of oil as it ran into the sea from Alaska in the havary of the supertanker Exxon Valdez 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed about it.
While the Shell Group is responsible for sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see drilling heads and leaking pipelines as the main causer.
Shell imposes significantly lower security standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner accused the Group in 2008: “Only the rate of defects at the lines is “multiple times higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-spoiled workshop in the open air, shapes emerge from the mangroves: they are split-spoiled and oil-spoiled to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group’s chief.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later, at the end of the pipe, kerosine and finally diesel drops out.
Thus, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 litres of diesel daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The diesel price of almost 40 euro cents per liter is ridiculously low and illegal cookers can still undercut the price, because they get their raw materials for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who capture the pipeline network across Ogoniland: in this way, according to experts, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost daily throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a disappearingly small portion of the temporarily stored raw material is illegally refined: organised criminal networks, including politicians and senior military personnel, fill the lion’s share in tank ships and store it on the world market.
The debate about whether the environmental catastrophe is due to the movements of the population or the lax manner of production, the activist Akpobari considers it purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and had not destroyed the fishermen’s livelihoods so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.”
Meanwhile, however, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell was so destroyed that only a deduction of the group could be questioned: “Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese prove to be better.”
Michael gets nervous.
“The highest time for you to disappear,” says the muscular oilman.
“Every minute the soldiers can come.”
If the illegal oil manufacturers are caught by the armed forces’ special unit, they are not threatened to be arrested, but a painful lubrication money.
Also, soldiers primarily coming from the northern country, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from the raw material.
“This fucking thing has put our country on the dog in every way,” says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous construction errors in A380 engines
The A380 has a serious security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction defect during the investigation of an emergency-landed machine that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas airbus in early November appeared to have had much more luck than previously known: the Australian Aviation Security Authority has identified a major security problem with the engines of some A380 machines during its investigations - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: with an oil hose connection, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, ATSB said in a statement released Thursday.
This could have led to “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Rolls-Royce engines in 20 aircraft of the A380 series are affected.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a grounds for complaint with an Australian federal court in Sydney to enable her to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the event of the engine fire, parts had lost and the supports had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil burn as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines worldwide need to be replaced.
Australian investigators have announced that they will carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The security recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine in an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Countrywide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Overnight almost all over the country has fallen snow.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is oversnowing on Thursday at night - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there are partly 15 centimeters thick snow covers.
On several highways and many roads traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not done with the constantly re-swelling snow.
In addition, heavy bursts over the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Shipping and Hydrography (BSH) is awaiting storm floods on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal level.
In Saxony, snow wefts on highways and federal roads led to serious problems.
According to the storm center Meteomedia, in Saxon Switzerland the alert level was purple - the highest level ever.
Partly there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused depression.
There were several trucks and cars stuck at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major road disturbances.
On the A2 snow and wind resulted in busy traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed upper lines and shifts are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snow winds swept over the streets.
In major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the Flight Information Center, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
Winter service is in continuous use.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still nearly 400 field beds available for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in the collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: a truck was also caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after carrying herself on a smooth road near Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will revolve when it is mild.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
Up to 500 million euros could be paid for the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurter Bankenviertel have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to retake the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes citing a spokesman.
The reasons for the planned sale were not mentioned by the spokesman.
“We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate on our own and then rent it back,” he said.
With this, Germany’s largest credit institution will return its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers by mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently extensively renovated them.
The energy transformation devoured the figures at around 200 million euros.
A sale would bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers", according to the newspaper, at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, it is still open at the moment, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourning for dead buddy
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies were still unable to be recovered because the security situation in the disaster shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, there had been a heavy explosion in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were dumped underground.
A probe had been dropped into the disaster shaft, but had not found any traces of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue personnel could descend for safety reasons.
After the second heavy detonation, authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in the sunshine in Greymouth on the South Island of New Zealand.
For two minutes they were silent.
In honor of the spilled miners, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the friends were seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were blowing on half mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants of the memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not end with the death of his son until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was poured into the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also spilled.
Rescue workers started extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases are displaced, the burning temperatures inside the mine will begin to cool down, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art theater?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn rebuilds old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think about when he filmed "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormenters and kills his opponents in a row with almost superhuman powers - it sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use raging killing methods and his enemies has already been destroyed by the dust.
On the other hand, single eye, as it is actually called, says the whole film about a word, and the other characters can also be pulled to one or two sentences or a few painful death screams at most.
Otherwise you will be quiet and enjoyed in the scary beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which the Viking world offers the backdrop of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult filmmakers with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Good if a movie has multiple target audiences, it is only a shame if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art theater friends are likely to be scared from the splashing around brain mass and bowels.
The action fans die from boredom at the latest when, for freely interpretable reasons, an eye with a troop of violent Christian missionaries breaks to Jerusalem by ship and is stuck for an eternity in mist before the crew apparently arrives in America and remains silent there.
So no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" did not find a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is a pity especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodshed facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a rigorous plot, it’s all an atmosphere, a filmed fever dream.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation, and with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack he slowly turns his throat, but above all with the incredible hatred that strikes him out of the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy, who stands loyal to one eye, keeps something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Mostly the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly an ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to angry, excited and amazed.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has found new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to comment on this – nor does it allow controls.
At midnight from September 5 to September 6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter planes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor Syria allegedly built with the help of North Korea in the quad, hidden in a valley that runs from the current.
According to a briefing by the U.S. foreign intelligence CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also common under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technology of the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
Through computer animation, she revealed where components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which is a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was just before commissioning, it said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, hardly any more is known than at the time, indeed the puzzles became rather bigger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but didn’t see any evidence that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of an “alleged reactor,” even if they think the CIA presentation is “plausible.”
They lack hard evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how sure he is to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat in the summer only replied lapidarily that the IAEA has "enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians rushed to side with the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008 an IAEA team under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack via a Member State, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client – perhaps Israel – bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed to have never run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium was derived from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – as has the satellite imagery.
It also denied inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of the bombed building.
Israel is silent, too.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently reaffirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case since June 2008 has gone unresulting and "develops increasingly into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - finally, there is a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-free treaty in the space that the IAEA is watching over.
The IAEA seems to see three other facilities “in functional connection” with the alleged reactor as key to progress in enlightenment – and unlike this one still exists.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which plants are involved, what function they have or what makes them seem suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these locations and found on satellite images a building complex near Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base – precisely on this grounds Syria denied IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy on military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had gained attention to the facilities through a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material has been transported round and round between the three locations and the Euphrates Quader.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
However, there is “no evidence of sensitive activities, i.e. enrichment or reprocessing of uranium; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.”
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from, there are at least plausible assumptions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could hold valuable traces were stored in the three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the debris has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which examined Syria in 1998 for its suitability as a deposit for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But recordings from the orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks in the three suspicious locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but it hardly helped clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets – only the effort shows the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also dismissed this proposal.
If western diplomats in Vienna had still calmed down a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter was not highly urgent, for example US ambassador Glyn Davies has been putting in the game for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the harshest means the Vienna nuclear agency has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of “an option for which I am open in the future,” but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this path: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Governor’s Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but an eagerness for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if they find nothing at all in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
You don’t know much more about it – but that’s enough for worry.
The rumor is persistent that the woman, a Muslim woman, falls in love with her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, after which some planned shooting days in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary shortly.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women Victims of War wrote about UNHCR’s UN refugee agency to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself an ambassador to the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she has already offered a meeting to women in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting should take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There have been no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude to the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN refugee agency, her organization has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
After some time, the Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read its script, has granted a filming permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author herself affirms that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard into the conflict in Yugoslavia, wanting to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
The lovers knew each other before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds significantly different than the variant "victims of rape hang in in torture slave".
That Jolie’s movie actually starts before the war – that’s sure.
The pressure on them, Jolie said, was “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now only the Hollywood hackers can bring her peace: by illegally putting the script on the net, as many have done before.
Nothing like getting out of here
This evening it’s finally going on for the Irish people.
No trace of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans jok with joy with crashing loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey Pub in Southern Cork trembles because players throw table tennis balls over a three-meter distance in beer cups - and hit.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euro victory award plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the Beerpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this crisp drinking game and the retained computer scientist doesn’t really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old tries to have fun distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
He doesn’t have fun playing in Las Vegas, he’ll be holding interviews in New Zealand in January.
“I have a muggy feeling with it,” he says.
“It’s so far from home and I still have no work there.”
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had ruck, zuck her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts from the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they are even expecting 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that in which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, sadness is now again becoming wide.
The economic crisis is especially uncertain about the young, well-trained Irish people, for whom so far it was only a climb.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
In the meantime, three in ten women and men under thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are additional readers letters from young emigrants who complain: “Everything goes down the stream in Ireland.”
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but who can goes away and our country loses an entire generation.”
"The last one, please, turn off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future as the government only conducts eye wiping and no longer offers young people prospects for the future.
“They’re reducing minimum wages, but they don’t have a strategy on how to create new jobs,” the 20-year-old said.
She watches her fellow students hanging from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is whether she will have to emigrate herself in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.”
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to take the topic up positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a full service on the topic of working abroad.
“For professional beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
Photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do with the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are just moving up a fashion house.
In January we will continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan sees his home rarely, because he does extra layers to pay off the loan for his home at home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again.”
He laughs a little laughing and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens, in the entrances large, expensive cars are parked.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent loaned.
“There were crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid it might go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer doesn’t like the lamentation he hears often now.
“No one has to starve – our situation is by far not as dramatic as in previous times here on the island,” he says.
“Working abroad for a while isn’t the worst thing that can happen – perhaps this will only make us feel like Irish.”
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
“After seven years he was back and life in Ireland went on, quite simply.”
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Leave the future open and just see how it goes with life elsewhere.
He has already worked for a few years in London, and why shouldn’t New Zealand work well for him and his girlfriend?
But there is still one thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He is afraid that it could turn into a goodbye party.
"Don't blow too many emotions," he says and drinks a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds frightening."
"Let's rather call it a walking party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The democracy routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is growing stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil’s influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts fall into the eye in this year’s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and, secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of proponents of democracy has increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the sharp downturn last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (chart 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both figures correspond to last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin American economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
This also continued during the world economic crisis, perhaps because Latin American countries only experienced a short recession period and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of departing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
It is only the second time since the survey began that many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country a bigger problem than unemployment (see chart 5).
Approximately 31% say either they themselves or a family member have been the victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The rise in economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and market economy: about 71% of respondents interregionally said that the private sector is essential to development, in 2007 it was 56% (see chart 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are in favour of a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, has nationalized many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the highest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the U.S., with Venezuela taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An electoral squad
No one had expected the elections in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the electoral supporters, who rushed to help the poignant country.
Overcrowded polls, multiple votes, voting bills in the stone, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Election rooms opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless due to the January earthquake, struggled around in search of a choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the cancellation of election results due to an alleged fraud.
There were partial violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election as “fairly good in many matters.”
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly committed to the unpopular departing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on December 7.
The expected target election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial suit for invalidity.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no approval among the voters, declares the voter to be the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims still live in tents, low electoral participation was feared.
On the day of the election, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to lack of organization.
Just before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election were not yet issued.
There's a lot at stake.
Donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following the sudden death of her husband, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to over 50%, which is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help her to be re-elected next year depends on whether the apparently mourning Cristina Fernández is more compromised than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who led economic policy even after his wife’s election, often set up budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential pair to spend the extra revenue in their own opinion.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost a majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further crushes.
Some regime critics from the ranks of ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (in which one parliamentarian hit another and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to adopt the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget now applies to next year, giving the President even more opportunity to spend money in her own opinion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is 11.1% at the time, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands from trade unions - drive the value to nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be his main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently enhanced official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She called on the private sector and the trade union leaders to talk.
And official statements say wage increases are expected to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth boost due to a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous redemption in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to push for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere.
But last month, Economic Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, which appears to be the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after the end of her term.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that was brought to her will be depleted.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly lift many of her husband’s political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the Strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which represents 70% of all voters, voted to elect mayors and councillors in the five districts, which is rated as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By establishing groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with China for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only briefly.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) ranks three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocated greater independence from Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have entailed problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the share of his party’s vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even entered the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were common events in Taiwan such as truck convoys with crawlers, flag-swinging mass conversions and only sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and chairman of honor of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election to a KMT candidate,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill links or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless of this, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has hampered the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
Taiwanese love their real independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing at the forefront.
But this time the DPP also avoided too much stimulating anti-Chinese feelings.
It reacted to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in jail for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he strongly defended absolute independence.
But under Tai’s rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of workers and youth.
As presidential candidate of the DPP, Tsai received great approval, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close ties with Beijing.
Tsai plans to create ideas as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that her party is offering a “trustworthy alternative” to mass rapid approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he stated that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged pragmatician Su to renounce the presidential candidature.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP finds it difficult to elect its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
But values are poor, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scissors between poor and rich.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong occurrence of DPP suggests that Taiwan is only limited in favour of a reapproximation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is no return anymore.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the Year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony, and now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year’s Grammy in the category Newcomer of the Year.
Given that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since their 2008 album Esperanza, the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it corresponds to the Grammy rules according to which an artist has released at most three albums before the release of the album, which he has become known to the general public.
Their ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her vibrant voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer comes closest in this category of Spalding's nomination.
The album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was also nominated in the category of instrumental albums.
Iyers competitors include "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophone player James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, where otherwise albums are more likely to be found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the big group category, so he competes against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a Democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leading in the classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is listed by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and the Synergy Vocals;
In the opera category were Bergs "Lulu of the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasse "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's.
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded in the Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonics led by Esa-Pekka Salons.
The 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkovski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumental Solo with Orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and many North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance for recording the works of Strawinski with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
This year only women were nominated as vocalists, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonova, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula wins planning committee approval
After a five-hour, often hot public hearing, the construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously promised by the local planning committee.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new Religion Centre will comply with local regulations and become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
“The project is supported by many good people – Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others,” Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
“As an American, this makes me proud.”
“It shows that justice prevails.”
“There are few opponents,” he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and the discussions for and against the building of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides distributed fairly evenly, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There’s no America anymore,” was a comment.
“It’s another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand.”
“America is at the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community, with about 135 families, has been living peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer of water filter systems.
The new 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque will have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It is expected to be built on the 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project with the city council.
Arsenal-resistant microbe could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria that can live from arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
“This organism has two options.”
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
“That makes it very special, although it’s almost a sort of ‘strange’ lifestyle,” said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online issue of the journal Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, as the scientists found, the bacterium in Mono Lake in California grows even further, even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“There’s a question of what else is possible,” said the report’s co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms in other planetary systems can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' that we think are absolutely vital to life are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Milton Keynes Open University in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes that are exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of Arsenal is primarily due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
“This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another.”
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus, it enters our biochemical system where it lubricates almost everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increased arsenic concentration, which adjusted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, it shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but there has not been a working example yet.
Arsen was more common in the early earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
“That gives reason to believe that life may have also developed differently than in the early Earth Age,” said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other Stolen Exhibition Dogs Found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, officials said.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, says Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is, the dogs are well,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not give any accurate details of the dogs’ findings or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigation is still ongoing.”
“We don’t want to say more about it,” Whitmore explains.
“We’re following some traces.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They took their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff officials found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old goat, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were uninjured, according to the official statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was scheduled to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the nearly one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder salary and microchips were implanted to identify the animals.
On Thursday it was not clear whether a finder wage would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
A New York bankrupt judge on Thursday officially blessed the "prepared" crooks' plan to pay off the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the reboot of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 is not effective until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
Currently, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself makes $75 million, is running the company, and the financing is expected to last until mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with an order to investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known for his activities at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve the financial concerns of MGMs and pay for the studio’s more than 140 fans took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company to buy at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from the start when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors after months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which have already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 monthly for running the company, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films, which will be produced under the direction of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can tear a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping ropes or about 48 cans play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into effect. This year, technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a broader offer on the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
More and more button cell-powered toys are coming on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise indicated, all prices are for Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plush figures, as large as sea pigs, singing a note when pressed on their belly.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you’ve started pressing, you can’t stop.
For a combination of song and dance, the Dance Star Mickey ($60 fisher price, for kids from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchangeable games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blocking, it masters the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device used Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for kids from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better-knowing with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to entrust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games included on it are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70 for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children over 8). The five blocks are not larger than a batch box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before the time runs out. It’s great for an improvised literary contest.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
These can be roller skates or a puffle fabric animal.
The latest head cell-powered micro robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for kids from 5) is not larger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly onto 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a crazy garden of cloths.
And he endures a lot.
Our fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in our dog’s mouth.
Police operations in China become softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a city square, checking his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and damped voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan – China’s rugged guards of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their inclination to violence – to impress the spectators.
"Just stand!"
"Look straight!"
"Show them," he whispered, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, hardly grown out of teenage age, in white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight row.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped loops.
"They look average to me," Mr. Tang notes disdainfully.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The Guangdong province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green one.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low-stamina: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly surrounded an improperly set-up dinner cart and stared at the operator until he packed up and left the square after half an hour.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the city’s police stripes, selected for their appearance, good character and youth.
They are supposed to give the brutal police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may only enforce urban laws by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely shows a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them with his cell phone beating a protest against a garbage shed.
Last year, a Beijing official training manual was stolen and published on the Internet, which describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handful of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street dealers.
“Chengguan scares the government,” the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, following further controversy regarding the tactics.
The newspaper called for “really thorough cleansing.”
Skeptics find the current approach clearly insufficient.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by advertising in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job ad, women aged 18 to 22 were searched for with a good figure and "harmonic facial features".
They should be above average tall - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to officials, work for women over 25 is too physically exhausting.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job first depends on their outward appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but besides, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district municipality, does not agree with this description,
However, she admitted that, in China, size standards in job listings for both sexes are not unusual.
The same applies to uniform face traits.
Whether it is good to look is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disruption do not need to apply.
"We can't use lame or buckling here," said Mr Zheng.
“Your image wouldn’t be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple pies and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not feel sexistic that so much emphasis is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the graves, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
They say they do not regret the short-term recruitment because they have more ambitious career plans than just scaring merchants through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strike deals with about twelve street dealers trying to sell as many breads and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before they are hunted away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so many times!" explains Fr. Xu to a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily left his pasta kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous rather than exhaustive.
“It’s almost the same every day,” explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"All Routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate merchants’ goods, like their male colleagues.
They can only threaten offenders by reporting them to their male supervisors.
This is intended to protect them from public hostilities that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the Yunnan province, ran after rumors that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officers were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown down or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violence.
But unrest cannot be excluded.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patroled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers paved their way to their vehicles with a grim face and proceeded with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old male strip coordinator, remained behind, turning his white name plate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators – men over 40 – play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we go verbally.”
“Sometimes, but also physically,” Mr. Li explains soberly.
“Most of the time people start fighting.”
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have exonerated Senator John Ensign from the charges raised against him after his affair with a former electoral officer and his attempt to lobby her husband, Senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that led to headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he was regarded as the Republican's potential presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate’s Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had ceased and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, and they believe that there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails, and other documents first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the presumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, helped with lucrative orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during the Ensigns election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work, and according to the documents and interrogations, he took over the lobbying for them after recruiting Hampton.
As Hampton was recently in Ensign’s electoral team, he was not allowed to take on lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on the turning door lobby.
According to the published evidence, "it seems to be an agreement and a breach of the rotary door statutes," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients targeted by the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said the Ministry seems very cautious in receiving political charges after a variety of defeats persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, to prosecute former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct.
Prosecutors “are obviously horrific,” said Melanie Sloan, chair of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (a organization aimed at combating corruption in US parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to trial.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign’s chief defender, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another one the next day, notifying him that the ministry would not file a lawsuit against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments he had raised to the prosecutors in more detail.
"I don't feel comfortable going into the details of the talks between the Justice Department and me, just as much as it is said: we believe we made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to cease the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, according to which a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The electoral commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything else than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after the company moved Mr. Hampton on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Chief of Staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "knocking" at the Interior Ministry about a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after Mr. Hampton had stopped lobbying.
Last year, when information about this affair first came to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the Republican ranking.
After not having noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was pursuing a third term in the Senate.
In an announcement that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of police investigation, his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the Senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will quickly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and cease its investigation.
“Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
A half dozen of them turned away in the clashes in the courtroom.
In a minute, they sent their reports on horrible witness testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape and bed-chained children trial in a house that was burning up.
On Thursday, the carefully pursued trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will come to an official end if the judgment on the death sentence of the jury falls.
However, Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have already filed applications to the court, stating the reasons for an appeal and which will deal with the courts for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense reporting on the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has resulted in a “circus atmosphere” and a so widespread, prompt penetration of insidious details that the jury has been influenced in an inadmissible way by public outrage.
This objection could cause the appeals courts to deal with the question of whether the new technologies can make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“Just as I experienced during this process, I think it’s really a danger that the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects every individual’s right to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye’s chief defender.
The chairman of the Supreme Chamber Court, Jon C. Blue, rejected the applications by decision last week when he said that the New Media would be "diligently controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court lawsuits have found that the coverage of famous cases raise doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic ruling of 1966, the United States Supreme Court repealed the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who allegedly killed his wife, saying in his ruling that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some believe that the TV series and the movie "On the Escape" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court actions that consider Mr. Haye’s conviction half a century later might follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communications out of the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in trials persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut, according to his report.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting prompt communication from the courtroom could make the trials more fair.
The Twitter affair is just one of many who depict Mr. Hayes’ lawyers to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been pre-convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrific scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their cultivator, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, had filled them with disgust.
The defenders say they would also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge wrongly exchanged a juror who was a critic of the prosecutor’s office, and that he would have exerted inadmissible pressure on the judgment when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the influence of detailed reporting on the process attract perhaps the greatest interest.
In a judgment contest that they filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the post of Governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
“Such a daily dispute of media pipes, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “you haven’t experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said the claim that these direct news messages are more upsetting than reports that are being reported slowly is a tech-aggressive view that impairs the coverage of future processes.
However, some lawyers said appeals courts would often be confronted with the argument that social and technical changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer’s lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was repealed due to the reporting, and made it clear that the New Media requires new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the end?
Following a campaign of blasphemy and negativity, little politeness broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before we quickly return to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congressional leaders brought no breakthrough in the major issues to deal with during the so-called “lame duck session,” the meeting at the end of a rule that no longer made any decisions.
After all that you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides or a consideration of their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial point accumulation.
The public meeting of the President’s Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that conceals the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other demands willingness to cooperate and compromise, while one itself is trying to weigh down the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party warfare.
Thus, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are kilometers away.
Lastly, the November election in Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution.”
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to obtain some or even all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Likewise, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax cuts for the wealthy while refusing support to unemployed workers.
After the White House meeting on Tuesday, optimism has risen that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratifie the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what happens from today until 2012, as a preliminary fight, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their formation.
No matter how worried the Republican leaders may be about pokering too high, they know they have to try to keep their promises to lower government spending and override health reform.
These party lines are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which involve a tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of retirement age and the reduction of government spending.
Vice-Chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pushed so much for putting the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are struggling to get close to even that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the panel, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for action or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when the Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes, and the health system, later followed by a phase of bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partisanness of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it happened in 1995, both parties must carefully pay attention to public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are now bigger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and the Congressional Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
Thus, the courtesy that is being shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that continue to separate the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it passes on to the Kremlin a portion of the bribes and protection funds that it collects, so the American embassy in Russia reported in February in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high protection funds so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “Vertical of Authority” – takes its part of the money that the ladder moves upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that he would have been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous defamation charges against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the ambassador, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Moscow government with crime has led some to call it 'disturbed' and to the conclusion that the government acts more like a cleptocrat than a government," the memo said.
Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends through the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help.”
The report further states that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, “declared that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as before.”
The memo notes that while raising funds is comprehensive, protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - due to the one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert committee, in an interview.
“But he’s part of this bureaucracy.”
“It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists.”
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Throughout the country, corruption is estimated to cost Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed from “the least corrupt” to “the most corrupt”).
The disclosure of the memo of the American embassy, which occurred after Moscow time late in the evening, will certainly trigger disappointments within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that the problems are resolved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a counterfeit, reacting angry to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we didn’t expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a weakly illuminated, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Due to his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the slaughterer", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge high quarter in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, longstanding followers in Anlong Veng are challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a community court of the UN and Cambodia condemned for the first time a former Khmer Rouge member when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng Torture Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts to reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodia’s society more difficult.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s documentation center, an independent organization that is exploring the regime.
“For her, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“It divides families themselves.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from illness, overhaul or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew up the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to move over to government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who did not give up, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his trial.
As their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the depleting poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from surrendering,” said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The current Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to court.
The task of the court is to condemn the ancient leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to alleviate the fears of Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told officials of Cambodia’s documentation center that she led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that presumably killed thousands of forced workers.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court invited her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
“If there were no more persecutions, there would be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court would charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia has to dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center said.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that they can understand everything.”
The centre created the first government-approved schoolbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the Ministry of Education’s high school, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be convicted by the court.”
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gradually gain influence,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Above in the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrowed by shrubs and stretched with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tire pile after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cell phone seller on the roadside, said she didn’t know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will drop a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to accumulate non-weaponable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure global nuclear materials, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons, will no longer be collected.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the security summit.
The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to no longer collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-enabled uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee, who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The deal seems to be one of the most important results of Obama’s “nuclear security summit of the 47 nations” in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next Summit in 2012.
“I was really excited that they wanted a seat in the 2012 nuclear security summit.”
“It proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weaponsable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... We won’t make dirty bombs from it and we won’t sell it to anyone.”
“We only use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
Nevertheless, a few months ago, Belarus approached the United States when it indicated its interest in reaching an agreement.
The first start to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly radiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that was more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second departure was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane according to the officials.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Energy Ministry working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Extensive Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-powered uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus will dissolve its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible approach.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
No objections by the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
This reflects the documents released by Wikileaks and transmitted to the daily newspaper El País (via cable), adding that former Deputy President María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft that fly over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe charged with aid to human rights-infringing practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega spoke.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "has met Zapatero on the outside" and reaffirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
“De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to intelligence flights across Spanish territory.”
"They just want to be informed" so as not to "be surprised unprepared," Aguirre reports via cable.
Former Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "will not pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because it is in the hands of the judges."
Attorney Vicente González, for his part, gave the embassy in January 2007 to understand that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish intelligence office (CNI) and the Minister of Defense about the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any harmful or sensitive information," the ambassador said after talking to the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely concerned about their independence and did what they deem appropriate," he had given his employees instructions to "leave inflated rhetoric comments to ease the tension."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP’s approach in this matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt this, from a note that the US government will tolerate or deliberately ignore Zapatero’s actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these disclosures could have a negative impact on the US government.”
The child murderer confessed that she complained on the internet about the "work" of maternity.
The young woman spoke of the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in the Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the internet "Muki".
She is in contact with a cousin and at least a girlfriend, both from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand these, one must know their love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructs on the basis of witness statements from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman started a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his former never allowed him to do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
“When I told him that, he felt good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free, to be able to do and let go of what he wants.”
Later, she mentions a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to send the boy to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like that I leave the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to imagine myself for a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. I will never leave him with anyone again except my mother," a doubtful intention considering their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not.”
On the one hand, he’s with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day.”
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will go to a summer course, so I have fewer expenses for the nanny."
17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss from Caesar asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the email, you see, if he wants, he finds me, that shit."
On the 30th one more: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer course to learn Catalan."
Their current partner, Víctor, said, “He’s shooting me money.”
On the internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison releaser."
"Terror a la galega (heading)".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting supervisor, explains that he has bites of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe it all happened because she didn’t tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
Attorney Carlos Maceda said she could not remember the course of the case, "and she had no intention of doing harm to the little one."
Earlier, she had admitted that César had been drowned in the bath and put his body in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutor’s office requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP already looks at the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party obtains in these elections is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend – the result of redirecting the PSC’s vote share and the PP’s vote bond – should continue, the PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (of 25) MPs.
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party's analysis, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its MPs or gain one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections in May 2011 will fall. Even then the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist dominance, in four provincial capitals and with their majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists cannot reach a majority or resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
Following the Republican debacle, it is not inevitable that this party will lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, where it would have to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play the main role in Tarragona’s transition, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
The PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People’s Party saw a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and seeks to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell secured Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police of the intelligence office of Barcelona formed the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombing in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeit apparatus Al Qaeda has been "weakened" worldwide and "thus their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were counterfeit, and then sent to the groups that composed the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could unpunishably cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The uncovered cell is not the only of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. That’s why, besides the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also been involved in the investigations. It cannot be excluded that similar attacks will occur in the territory of the EU in the coming days to that of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) another was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistani prisoners Muhammad Athar Butt and Si Zeeshan Buttburik were arrested.
They had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network – part of which was destroyed in 2009 – stealed tourist passports in particular according to the rules of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigative groups have stressed that there has so far been no evidence of links between the arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, although the author of the bombing was "Lashkar e-Taiba", one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently counterfeit in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent from through a money transfer company, which was "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", which ended the lives of 106 people.
Police have seized extensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to postpone tax agreement
The Chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present Artur Mas personally her conditions to support his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are not different from those already set up during the election campaign and can be combined with the priority of the economic recovery and the failure of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement.
The president of the Catalan People’s Party, with the certainty that she was given to Artur Mas by the 18 deputies she won last Sunday – a figure that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable, because the candidate from the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to vote in his vote.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to make in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but the talks that Mas is currently holding with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As regards the party chairman of the PPC, it demands that all discourses relating to Catalonia's sovereignty and independence, as well as an agreement on financial compensation between the State and the Autonomous Region - similar to in the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum, be put behind.
It is common for both political leaders to make the regional administration’s expanded political apparatus leaner and to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat are dealing with the details of the negotiations on the assumption of Mas.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a harsh opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Senior Care Home reiterates that the deaths are not due to “lack of measures”
The owners of the old-age home in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed over eleven elderly people
The officials of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference, in which they revealed the harm that the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for during his work - had caused to the facility.
The head of the elderly care home, Joan Sala, appeared in court accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat wants to charge the person responsible (for the deaths)", but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only accept a loss of social reputation because it did not determine the nurse’s criminal acts in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the elderly care home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illness.
The head of La Caritat completely denied this point, stating that "lack of action could never have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in the litigation there is no evidence of negligence by someone other than the accused.”
He confessed eleven murders yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, as opposed to the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said the staff’s access to the medications was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and sedative cocktail in six of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with the death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had confessed to three women whom he killed between October 12th and 17th.
In La Caritat, the nurse’s statements are not believed, not even as to the number of murders confessed, which could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to change his approach suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to justice for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threat signs of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to respond.”
The risk increases of euro-peripheral changes have increased dramatically and European banks’ shares have risen by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be deceived and that the euro has hardly increased at points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market that is recovering to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank urged us to reverse our liquidity receipts, according to which tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably a few more times in the future, the ECB will have to withdraw.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan for the purchase of public debt, as they are ineffective, as well as the repeal of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures, which should only be maintained for a week of indefinite access.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect the program to buy bonds to continue and emit a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, yesterday’s excellent market response will be thrown back, and if we are keenly insisted to withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just like at the May ECB meeting, at which the bank reaffirmed that it did not consider the purchase of government debt and that the markets collapsed, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of one-year government titles in Portugal was fairly weak.
State asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 base points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of markets according to Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to be approximately 10,000 billion in the short term and possible another 15,000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks are nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after not recognizing the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government must receive parliamentary approval of its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate with regard to the summit of the heads of state and the government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalization, privatization and employment procurement measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is an authoritative auction of a three-year state bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we are putting on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our ability to redeem our debt.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without delay.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now counts not only being, but also appearance.”
Just courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Owls, at the request of his children, appeals to Vega Sicilia’s shareholder assembly
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the societies Owls and El Enebro, does not flood.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate guard, will challenge the shareholder assembly of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, considering it "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute to control part of the group.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding does not appear to be willing to give up in his litigation over the control of the bodies of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who appointed themselves as members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders’ Meeting of January 18th of this year, which is already registered in the Commercial Register as contested.
The shareholder assembly of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the Alvarez family.
The appeal of the judge to the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the assembly of the shareholders.
The latest strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have the assembly, declared null, recognised through legal conspicuity, fraudulent actions and abuse of the law on 18 January," official spokespersons said.
This argument is the basis for the challenge of the assembly afterwards to declare it "absolutely void."
The same protagonists, who wrap themselves in discreet silence, already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a assembly on a judicial basis.
At El Enebro, a company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, along with other assets, David Álvarez’ seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right to use more than 51% of the capital.
This is the real background of the matter which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the treatment of the appeal proceedings for which no date has yet been fixed.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been shaped by the speed of surprises and successes in this refined universe.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steep ascent during the last seasons, all bet on Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari’s victory at the final track last November.
Without wanting to lower the capabilities of German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into its hands and thus created a winning team has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This PLM computer science program has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
Faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of the Siemens Industry Department, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that can be detected on the race and in the tests can be designed and executed.
Russwurm states that in 1992, on average ten technicians worked in the race stands, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in one season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed in Red Bull’s team, and with powerful computer equipment, they perform analysis and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens manager said the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, except for the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend on their races in one season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacturing of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly limited.
All that happens there is top secret.
The workforce comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull’s true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts in the services of his participation on the race tracks, other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose notoriety is equal to zero, are hiding.
The factory’s chief technological officer, Steve Nevey, emphasizes that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in R&D for racing cars contributed to victory at 50 percent and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computing because they are “unpredictable gladiators.”
HP will open twenty stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive shop in collaboration with partner Ront Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
It is the first of a sales network of twenty stores of 80 to 100 square meters each that the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees on this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales areas, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
Helena Herrero, deputy chairman of HP España, cited as an example the rebuilt store at Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group plans to establish 200 sales locations in Europe by 2010, 20 of them in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming new openings, but did not exclude that Madrid could be the next target.
The Deputy Chair, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). All shops in Europe will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it’s not a franchise system and highlighted that the exclusive point of sales network intends to “optimize customer service and advice to small and micro enterprises in purchasing and afterwards, even packaging.”
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that guarantees the technical problems of HP devices.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
“This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days.”
“This system has been developed especially for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, as large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service,” said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal a million customers from rivals in three years
Banco Sabadell’s CEO, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it anticipates a decline in interest margins, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to take advantage of the next three years, surviving in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without the use of public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of a million private customers - 700,000 if you withdraw the customers that the bank will lose - this is the big challenge facing this bank, because so far it has devoted more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share among retail customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual financial statement.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the global financial crisis has messed up all the banks’ plans.
This year, Sabadell will complete its four-year-old Optima guideline, initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it has been extended for one fiscal year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the bank’s main goal.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola emphasized that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a large range."
The manager assumes that Spain would only “slowly” get out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental for the survival of banks.
Even if it assumes that the war for liabilities - which punishes the interest margins - will float, the risk additions that banks and savings banks must pay for their issuances to obtain liquidity will already be rolled to the loan price as a compensation for declining profit margins.
“The issues of liquidity and financing are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans.”
“We didn’t turn the cock off, but the interest differences are very high,” Guardiola admitted.
Banesto issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict long-term loans and increase interest differences (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently following the stategie to "raise the fees", but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s guideline is based on organic growth, even if the group does not exclude corporate businesses, as always.
It is not for nothing that he assures that larger companies are needed in Spain.
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He emphasizes that the demand for capital is currently "enormously rising" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red figures.
He believes that FROB could replace the money market in the event of capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of markets, he undermines the argument of some bankers who are already prophesiing a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be put into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repo transactions and thus intercept the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of fusion of savings banks
The Director General of the ECCA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that there could be a fusion wave of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks started, several savings banks insisted they did not participate in the first phase and they retained the second round.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Cash Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I think the majority of the mergers have been completed and the inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, but rather adjustments."
"The majority is completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all major processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all operations."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process "was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely course that was set in earlier times, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de España."
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta explained that "there would be a number of inappropriate opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed irresponsibility and nonsense," because "Banco de España urges us to complete in time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and “perhaps” the whole world, adding that those who doubt this would do “without deeper knowledge”.
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we need to "not worry" about the situation of the financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to retain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, the regulation of temporary labour enterprises or the lifting of €426 support for unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Deputy President Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, who has screamed out the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on the design of our future, which collides with the maintenance of the traditions of most of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reintroduction of the German Mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is a reform of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: greater macroeconomic control; strict financial management; punishment of the countries that violate the requirements; the suspension of payments for some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been standing out for some time, so now there are no excuses.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out a constitutional reform to prevent this from starting in 2016.
This was the first sign of the difference between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to rescue Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the public opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel once again has a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union agreements to enable the rescue of a country while at the same time committing private lenders to bear a portion of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it pushed forward the Irish crisis and everything else.
But their proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even though unpopular measures need to be taken now, the old way the euro operates will no longer exist from that date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area, in which the countries that contravene will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in this case the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to pursue a strong growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderating consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and positive foreign balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not understand it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will go into more tranquility.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero also understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in his own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t look like something would change.
Among the possibilities considered is that we should leave the euro area full of poorly serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it had warned us.
Sports and regulation avoidance
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to bypass a sanction.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23rd match against Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being poured on whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is commonly known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed penalty in the next league match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the arising debate about the case depicted comes from a team of the Real Madrid football club (who claims nobility and honor in his anthem and on other occasions had punished his players for similar incidents) playing the main role, and from the drama by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history than a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute bypass of rules; in fact, this approach is consistent with the statutes of sport, but seems to bypass its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the unjustified benefits of the opposing team by the offender.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand as false gambling or bypassing rule, because the bypass of the rule was not carried out in secret to avoid a penalty, but it should be as striking as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and accepted the penalty with joy.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders derived from the deliberate faults.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was neither put into an unfavourable position nor were there any benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that their own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It’s also not a useful strategy for the next game, as the club doesn’t have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it's a long-term advantage, to a certain degree uncertain, as the team could also leave at some point. In addition, players with this procedure will receive a penalty and go into the second card cycle, where they leave with a card accumulation less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear if this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not against the sports spirit, which also includes strategic decisions to make the most of the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to bypass a penalty (that would actually be a clear case of rules bypass), they preferred to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a penalty or fleeing from it.
Although the boundary between the invention and the regulation environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of the invention.
I have the impression that the controversy arose as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the rule transfer provoked.
The damage caused to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer Offensive for Group Christmas Dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops an avalanche of reservations to the 16th and 17th of December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading, they do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are again group dinners in the pre-Christmas season, which deliver oxygen to Barcelona’s catering and leisure industries. But as a result of the economic crisis, they launch a price offensive to capture the customer segment that represents the large mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, which confirms
To make the accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders into the week of December 13th, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations to two top cages (16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economy is, lower prices are being demanded, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona Restaurant Panel, Gaieta Farràs.
The representative of the roof association does not yet dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it a hundred times before booking."
“They would like to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those "offering quality at good prices with good service," he adds, reminding us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand for 25 euros.
A survey of several restaurants in the centre shows that the evening of December 17 leads to a collapse of the providers.
The Soteras group says the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Group, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost since the second quarter of the year, the revenue has been blooming again and good, although focused on a few days, prospects for the Christmas business are anticipated.
The company group’s sources emphasize that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more as a prize hit. You have the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details in return, such as Cava.
In some companies, you can also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back in recovery.
On the part of the Fecasarm Roof Association (with associations such as the Pub, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the Deputy Chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts in seeing the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations overall are quite "living", although customers "strike out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating did not decrease, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons faster than any other country.
Wikileaks reveals relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks internet portal, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
At the edge of the clarifying and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being strengthened, but rather "decreasing" and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country."
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – that the weapons are not composed, but are stored in order to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack – prepares Washington sleepless nights.
Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, said in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory attacked by the Taliban, the presumed scattering of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenal and missile programs is no longer regarded by the United States, but also by Russia, as exemplifying and reason for caution.
“Pakistan has to hire strictly faithful personnel to guard nuclear facilities; because of the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who are involved in nuclear or rocket programs,” said Yuri Korolev, an expert from the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
The new documentary revealed by Julian Assange’s internet portal is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear distribution is slowing down and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy’s office, which describes communication with Pakistan as “fructuous,” said: “There is often no transparency; on aid offerings we don’t get answers or they are rejected.”
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, a state intelligence official for South Asia, confirmed that "despite the economic catastrophe Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit by the chief army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to “clear” to the responsible party that “Pakistan’s army must cease its silent support of terrorist groups.”
On the hunt for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior anti-terrorist fighter to prevent new disclosures.
Interpol issues a red warning on the persecution and finding of Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Interpol issued a “red warning” on Assange’s “finding and persecution.”
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
It’s not new, it’s from November 20.
It has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of more than four million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
The lawyer for Wikileaks founder Mark Stephens said the police “knew where and how to contact Assange.”
The international police agency based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving authority by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and find Assange "to provisionally arrest and deliver him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member states consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange presumably resides.
Assange’s lawyers, who gestured, published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recalled that Assange applied for the departure from Sweden and was approved by the prosecutor, who was compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s chief of security.
“It’s like a hunt, not like a legal prosecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and his mother from Australia assures her son's innocence - Assange stops in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday, he gave the head of Time a Skype interview from an indefinite location, requesting the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violate international agreements signed by the United States, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "laughing and absurd."
“I’m not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior anti-terrorist fighter, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators have announced these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January onwards, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and track anyone who supports or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
“Whoever has been leaking information in the government is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not execution is a mild punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks with a blink to the nearby Carod peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on his continued office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a prescription to avoid for the tenth time an internal riot in the ranks of the ERC after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the voters.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not cause him the same headache as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a blink of eyes, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the beginning yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could secretly comment on his remaining in office.
With voting cards, not with raised hands.
If the carodists wanted to miss a penalty to the president, they could do so without having to fear retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he reaffirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added without indicating percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The nearby Carod demand more from the president than just to make his office available to the party, an insufficient gesture as Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the Board of Directors on a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership will submit to the Council for vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to secure for Puigcercós, and in return he promises to put the Congress before the autumn of 2011, which the party’s head already thinks is a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC is of the view that the "polyphony" is a shame for stability and he strives once and for all to make the organization able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the current counselor Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovation thought it was a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for various objectives".
He counted five, two of which were in the forefront.
First, the "restructuring" of the board so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party's members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second one could be the great news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the general assembly principle as a way of functioning.
In this way, he defends a reform of the statutes, which will allow the congresses to hold with elected delegates.
Puigcercó's team, which has fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
Indeed, at the shaking assembly of 2008, the party leadership was commissioned to review the general assembly principle at a Congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This deadline is still pending, as infogle of the internal uprising of recent years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on hold, the time could have come to resume and complete this matter forever.

Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction goals
The Chinese representative said at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and would maintain its supply to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16.
At his first public appearance at the 16th UN Climate Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and transform its industry.
He said his country has invested $245 million in the last four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals but would work with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution-building, and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the passing of a new energy law last year, which includes the goals for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the state authorities of the central state and the municipalities had worked together to achieve the goals of energy saving, efficient use of energy and reducing emissions.
Furthermore, he stated that several multi-year plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Effective Energy Use Program, which has been introduced over the past five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private hands.
There is also a provincial project on climate change, another on the exchange of traditional bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another on the mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than would be commonly assumed.
He pointed out that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China amount to six tons per person, while in the United States there are 100 tons. China is responsible for a total contribution of nine percent to pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use: energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent over the past five years and another project is to be made by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion of Spinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panicist party leader had the right to call on the National Order Commission and demand whatever the right belonged to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was rightful and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to contact the National Order Commission and demand whatever the right belonged to him.
In an interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state before the appeal, he said that the exclusion of Espino was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Ordinary Commission in Sonora."
“Mr. Espino has the right in his case to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional via the appeal procedure to make a decision by a competent body,” he added.
On the other hand, he explained, it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on December 4 and 5, in which his successor was elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a preliminary proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader stated that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "the internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best chairman or chairpersons that would need Acción Nacional for the next three years, so he would hand over the fats "to the one that the Council would designate."
"I'm quite unconcerned and open about this, and I'd be proud to give each of the five the office of party leader."
He predicted that the upturn of the party in the last July 4 elections would be reflected in the upcoming elections, although "it is not time to think of 2012."
“Now it’s about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task.”
In this context, he emphasized that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would be carrying the flag and observed throughout the country, which is why "many hopes and longings are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the demands."
When he was questioned about the criticism of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in his four-year government, César Nava called on the supporters of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally get out of the closet,” he said.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government could make expressions such as those in his speech in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouth ban, let alone a censorship.
Obama Twitter Advocates for the Law for Undocumented Students
“If you’re in favour of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and urge them to pass this law,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization to support the Dream Act – the law to legalize undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you are in favour of passing the Dream Act, call your senators and urge them to pass this law,” Obama tweeted.
His briefing contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document that urges the public to get in touch with their senators, as the vote on the law is imminent.
“With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you,” he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law, except expanding tax cuts from Bush’s time and expanding government financing.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republicans’ blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue is resolved, a schedule could be set for the other projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax matter must be resolved before the end of the year."
"I think we can make an agreement about it at any time and after that we can plan the course of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that "he would ask for the vote at the end of the debate" to allow the Dream Act to vote on the initiative to legalize undocumented students in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not sixteen years old while living in that country for the last five years and enrolled in a higher educational institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the passing of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side in case other Democrats decide to turn back on the initiative.
Among the most recruited Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted in favour of the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act is facing the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust for the Language' was a walk where the participants made themselves strong for the narrative
"I understand this with sex in the language, yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-language literature and on that occasion explained the subtitle of her question (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in the language).
The finger in the wound... "brings us in trouble," the Argentine writer sweetly spit towards the audience, which was composed mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this Round Table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attending Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Monte Luis García.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then marked the Shultz as a great narrative. Luisa tells in first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she receives no answer, but clues for the guide to her Narrative
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who robbed her breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explained to her that wound was not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: “the wound is the truly open, the symbolic is the scar.”
The main character of the story sighed and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it is truly open and does not exist". But she is convinced that the pleasure for the language and its traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a lovely narrative, which he called "praise of the invention", in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With references to magic realism, he tells of a famous sorcerer who touched the clouds, brought men back far-traveled or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a turning point and told of America, the great novel, to which he did not lack his own chronicler from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who recounted the overflow of Er.
Cervantes, who invited us all, mocked the false witnesses who appeared in the stories depicted as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told – with imagination that even lost the shame.
However, he emphasizes that "the madmen and liars are the ones who imagine things best", and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
This is what he calls the “Cervantes tradition”.
“We have inherited from him to be what is told.”
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL's invitation to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman devoted her contribution to the great wound of social violence that affects her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a quiet, not intentionally planned commitment," she explained after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also raised "this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer".
He noticed that in a fast-moving world, intellectual habits and control of consciousness also run out to dogmatism, and forgot that "behind every confirmation is a little no and behind every denial is a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuance: and nuances often mean putting the finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also notice the powerful who prefer to harass the black to the world.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he played crucial games three times.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final match, two different styles are opposed, specified by their respective coaches, and their encounter characterized by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but he has had decisive games three times, and so far he has kept himself well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentinean has become the second champion with the medal, remained one step behind the winners and surprisingly he played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist stratege reached the first final as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when Del Morelia had the lines in his hand that he had a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he achieved the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to set a setback again, as the game ended by 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the elf-meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two ways to plug in his title, but ultimately lost to 3
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he doesn’t want to be chased again by misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
“I want to be a champion, I don’t want to break statistics, that’s for a club, for my affection to whom I devote myself, and that’s why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing,” he said.
"The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee whistles the end, we can't celebrate, we're ready at the line, the players are ready to finish too, because the last time we were not ready with two eleven meters, and I believe that is not a lesson until the game is ready to exit.
Knowing that this series could be decided by elf-meter shooting doesn't worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at elf-meter shooting, you don't want to finish this in the regular time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for the end of the tour we were already prepared, but unfortunately the fateness prepared us a bad game, sometimes as a result of the nervousness there.
It is in Romanso’s power to no longer be just the second champion and to taste the fame that the titles bring with them for the first time.
The U.S. changes the rules for receiving a visa
The persons must present themselves for visa application before their conversation with the consulate at the service agencies; costs will be shortened waiting times in this way.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States embassy and the consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must introduce themselves to the visa application offices (ASC) before they speak in the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall retain the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the conversation.
The new procedure has certain advantages for aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will decrease, as it is no longer necessary to pay the appointment arrangement, processing of the visa application and the transportation service by which the document is handed over separately.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including visa for temporary workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to talk to the consulate, they only have to imagine themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date to talk to the consulate will remain there less time than before.
Those applying for a visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the $26 service fee.

NASA announces finding extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called for a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aerospace Agency (NASA) announces tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The find will be presented at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
At the press conference, NASA assured that it would introduce “a supervisory find for the search for extraterrestrial life,” which triggered speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that human-like creatures could exist in enemy environments that were previously thought to be inhabitable, and the hypothesis was raised that they could transform into intelligent living beings — just like humans — if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, living there in an environment that was thought to be too toxic for all possible forms of life, as the lake is strongly arsenic.
In some way, the microbe uses arsenic as a survival resource, taking into account this ability, the chances that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere increase.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life that is different from that known to us."
The space agency will announce tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference the actual scope of its findings.
The conference was attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of life on Mars, and by biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (Saturn’s largest moon), asking whether its chemical composition resembles Earth’s.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patron form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system is introduced, they complain.
The sixtieth legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc was already set up, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent person. The four questioned the entry of the 'Two Party System' into the Chamber.
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez de Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law.
With this reform, they repeated, a ‘two-party system’ would be introduced, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau referred to by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as Deputy Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political margins with these reforms.
He stated that in the coming days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting from their political will and if they did not, they would be subjugated again by both parties, ending the opposition coalition.
"Until here I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even take into account the opinions of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia declared that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patron and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after it was monopolist, is now supposed to be "duopolist."
“It is not the spirit of law reform that Congress should have an eternal two-party system.”
“For the beginning, this group starts with five MPs and they are talking to other colleagues to make them more,” the member of Convergencia said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT stated, in reference to PAN and PRI, that the Congress had now turned into a ‘prey’ for two.
“Before it was only one party, now they divide it in two.”
Patron Montalvo requested that the Members be respected and assigned their place at the negotiating tables.
"The five, who are currently seen as being divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table because because of the reform carried out and agreed by the others, we remained outside and we disagree with this reform."
200 000 pesos more for "the supplier"
The municipality of Mazatlán is paying another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another cheque of just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the municipality.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the company in the second half of the year for electrical materials is 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued to an amount of 200,144.56 peso was issued with the number 9258447 on 16 November with the purpose of "billing open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already anticipated that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier, which is observed by the Auditoria Superior del Estado because it is sold at overpriced prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you still owe her and, as a result, the number of cheques still being issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought from her, it’s just being paid off the debt, just like with the other suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the latter on November 16.
Although the Supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is questioned by ASE in order to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published the examination of the cheques issued by the municipality to its suppliers on July 25, it was announced that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010 during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez had paid the municipality over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam, where it received checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist in the invasion of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and throw a poor picture of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Trader Association, recalled that on various occasions it was called for to maintain the destination and to transform the poor conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor state of the roads and walkways had negative effects as tourists would come to wander and see the disorder, after which they would turn their back to the nearby shops.
“Politicians don’t know what it means to have to close a business one day, and they don’t worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn’t do the construction work in this way slowly and unplanned.”
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist had alerted to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid such a thing happening again. How should it do it? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything backwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting for a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, we residents also have the right to a clean habitat. The city administration needs to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look insufficient and unfinished," he said, "for example, El Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, we need to offer a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in shots," he added.
“These arrangements have not been paid enough attention and these kinds of incidents merely represent what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be used properly and created a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to front with the city, making the city clean, neat and attractive to tourism should be priority.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that should first be cleaned up and cleaned up to make them attractive to tourism and deliver them to the inventory with which we are advertising for this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of giving an example for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
The corporate sector of Mazatlán demands a dignified parliament, free of agreements between parties and the government, because Sinaloa is in trouble and faces major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 MPs from the PRI, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM. This makes up a total of 40 representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and the different social groups relying on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Coordination Council, suggested that the new Members should take the great responsibility to set a role model for a better Sinaloa that faces many challenges.
"We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is common for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus turning them into carnival compasses of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We take care that they do a trustworthy job and work for society and its groups, especially because it was the Sinaloa residents who gave them their trust in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 people’s representatives is the drive and joint work for the state’s economic growth, because today’s economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation.”
With regard to the tourism sector, he called on the new Members to give the necessary place in the state budget to promote the Ministry of Tourism.
"I understood that it is the ministry with the second least means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Tourist projects need to be allocated funds, state security needs to be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislature, needs to be updated.
The Holy King is being sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family are looking forward to dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for the parents to fulfill these wishes on the next Three-King Day, because the household consists of no more and no less than twelve people and one goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
"Sometimes there are difficult times because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go out on the street with the goors to sell," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a monster car for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús proposes clothes in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I'd like this monster so much,' but I replied, 'let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is size 12; ten-year-old Isaías is size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is being sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 alleged drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, as part of the breakdown of a production and sales network of cannabis, the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie were carried out.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will be faced with various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served predominantly for drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a spokesman for the Quebec security police.
In total, eleven men and three women were arrested, of which two of the men who are considered to be the main wire drawers of the drug ring were from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were reported to have appeared in front of the court building in Sherbrooke hours after they were arrested.
They could be charged with, among other things, the production of cannabis, the possessions of cannabis for sale, the conspiracy, and the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigative activity that took place for over a year.
"The information obtained from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," Ruel said.
Around the 70 police officers of the regional investigation unit Estrien, the Quebec security police, the Sherbrooke police department and the Memphrémagog police agency had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could be easily followed
According to the government, the Conservatives’ bill to resolve the issue of ships loaded with secret immigrants will likely be stamped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
“I strongly oppose this charter.”
"I stand with a party that has put chains on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person to be arrested for up to a year by a ship identified as being used to transport illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Constitution as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the bill because he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed, so we will wait for what the government will do," Duceppe said.
Criticism of the immigration issue of Olivia Chow, NDP, has hand-held critics who demand that her party behave not steadfast enough toward the secret immigrants.
“The neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to enforce through the mediation of another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it seeks guilt among the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
“Canadians urge MEPs to notify them that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal actions that affect Canada and treat the country like a footstepper.”
“They expect Canada to take harsh measures,” said Minister Kenney.
“The government has not announced any vote of trust in its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
A conservative, however, told the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that each opposing MP immediately declares itself to its voters.
The new unity does not find unanimity
Despite Jean Charest’s announcement of the possible creation of a new, standing unit to combat corruption and collusion, numerous observers continue to call for the establishment of a public investigative committee on this topic.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, Wednesday’s announcement surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the occasion of the meeting of the permanent committee of the Quebec Police Service on October 29 last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, also qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as “hattered rabbit” as well as “sounded solution at a table end”.
Minister Dutil, in turn, had turned to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the questionable future unity.
“You will see the result when we announce it,” he said.
“We are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, president of CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
“The more Mr. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this investigative committee, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only way to be able to form an investigative committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and policy systems at the ENA.
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes that Quebec grant a special mandate to the financial audit audit so that it can conduct investigations about corruption and secret agreements.
"We should be able to extend the mandate of the audit," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the audit the same power as Commissioners, which would also allow it to compel people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the Criminal Act in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request came from Operation Marteau’s chief prosecutor, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Spring 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle policemen, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the law against gangstership.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has fallen in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, there was a landslide on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A street has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, heavy rainfall of 40 to 70 millilitres has fallen on several regions.
Another 20 to 40 millimeters of rainfall were expected by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
Up to 100 millimeters of rain shower had fallen here.
Since the snow melting that has already accumulated in certain sub-areas is to be added to these rainfalls, it is feared that several streams will transit.
On Wednesday evening, warnings were issued by the Quebec security service about the flood alarm concerning the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and continue to remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the transgression of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was torn away due to the heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, according to security adviser Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State Highwater Centre issued warnings of the heavy rise of several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially rebuffed
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Supervisory Board (CCNR) for his controversial comments on social welfare and Haitians, as well as for his failed radio speech.
The CCNR is of the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinion, but certain comments would contain "inaccurate information about social care and unjustified negative representations of Haitians, as well as such unscrupulous speech that is not appropriate for day-to-day broadcast broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a debate on suicide, which involves the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, violates the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasts during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first order was filed following a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization complained that the amounts mentioned in the program were inaccurate.
Instead, moderators should provide solid information as misleading.
With regard to the topic of suicide, the presenter Stéphane Dupont had argued that the suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of members of the Supervisory Board had concluded that the message transmitted here was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the relevant consequences of the Dupont le midi broadcast would have addressed a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not blamed against his person.
The last point of dispute was the statements related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given themselves a media-effective discussion in this regard that led to a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had stated that he did not donate in favor of Haiti’s aid, as it would not be sure whether the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
“I’ve already missed my three-day suspension sentence in this matter.”
“My file has been virgin for a year and a half,” the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of an unfinished expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcasting channel acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcasting station, which, among other things, was to have notified its decisions once during the main broadcasting period within three days, are slight.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Naceddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full-contact kung-fu), kickboxing and thai boxing, now goes up in search of new challenges to the tatami and to the boxing rings of the world.
“I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago,” Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008, said.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, as for those who don’t like the ground fight, as it is presented by the mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, the man who worked as a security officer and employed at UPS had given his rivals bad news by winning two gold medals from World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the amateur world championship held between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and thai boxing," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
"The fighters from every category had been invited to rank among the first four at the last World Championship."
"I'm getting bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I became eighth in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth noting that I have made progress in every competition."
“With this rhythm, I’ll be first this time or next year!”
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China in which fist beats and footsteps as well as floor kicks are permitted.
Dual fights usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer arising from this kind of martial arts is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal retained only one event in his career, he would surely call his presence in the Super Tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"This competition is the highest rank and most respected in China," the sympathetic poundsman said.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
“It was a super experience.”
Ten times in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) he had won his first fight before then losing in the final.
“The one who defeated me was a real professional,” he said.
"There are four teammates per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the King of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant project planning companies $450 million in contracts for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts there is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of $295 million without a tender.
This consortium, called "Energie Gérance", was formed in 2004 as an accompanying appearance of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector its responsibility to hand over this important hydroelectric project amounting to $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Gérance consortium acquired the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem, which creates the risk of displacement of competition and price increases.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and defeats competition."
“It means that instead of playing games in a secret way, we are now playing in an open form,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at the press conference yesterday.
Early in the morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems to him difficult to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by vehemently rejecting that this contract was a default game.
"I remain true to my line," she whispered, encouraging the PQ to be "unfair" and "lacking her hardness."
She said it was “the least” that the PQ apologized.
The consortium’s model is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their expertise on a bid for a bid for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its work size.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be set up by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without a competition struggle; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the consortium model in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief overflight of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of permanent duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult.
Each link, and there are several dozen of them, leads to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
Regarding the Energy Gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been taking special account of this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d'Energie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has left the nose over the fact that the contract for the project management has been approved according to agreement.
"If you tender and there are few candidates, your prizes will rise fast."
“So you have two options: either you take the people on this mart and tell yourself, you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price.”
"The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the individuals," Laporte said.
This contract granted to the Energy Gérance Consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consultant contracts that companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, were approved between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had concluded 22 contracts on its own, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these agreements have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract with "Énergie Gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau said the PQ was equally linked to the companies she "financed" before clarifying that it was their executives.
Barometer conscious consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Green, but unwaveringly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but not in the brands or the eco-labels that are to control his choice.
Too bad, though it bathes in a media-effective universe, where it is only so packed with information for a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain, an insufficiency that identifies itself as a brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed yesterday.
Although they advanced the consumption of so-called socially tolerable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to give little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec’s population admitted that they didn’t really believe in the company’s environmental commitment as much as green corporate advertising, the sophisticated measuring instrument from the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke revealed.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently being revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one-third of Quebecers are distrustful of the stated performance of the green products and services that they are endeavouring to put to their hands.
In 2010, more than half of consumers changed their habits and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from retailers in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible – the index of eco-conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year – Quebec’s Homo consumus loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
However, social and ecological awareness seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers said they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the carriage center to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Footwalking and cycling were also endorsed by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavior survey feeding the stereotypes.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been asked by the Société Angus and the Parallèle Company to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema complex eXcentris, which is owned by Daniel Langlois on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, to return it to its actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they have requested.
The government has agreed to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond at less than the initially expected amount that could create an existential solution under beneficial conditions, at least in the opinion of sources removable from the state-run kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the petition has been corrected sum-down since the new one.
A proposal along with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who heads the act eXcentris.
Several days ago he had sent her a final report.
However, the Cabinet’s counter-proposal was transmitted to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallele and Angus now have time until 31 December to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of the state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Remember that the Quebec ownership community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture did not provide financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he did not provide to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained, in contrast, of substantial economic aid.
Film director Daniel Langlois had, for more than ten years after the self-financed construction of the cinema, presented the author’s cinema in the premises of his cinema complex under great difficulty, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the State Caisse.
The lack of cinema halls showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clients at the bar.
The Société Angus and the Parallèle company, with Christian Yaccarini at the top, are launching a privately funded campaign, from which they expect a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one canvas has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallele.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not withdraw the newspaper "Le Devoir" and ignore what he and his group think of the downwardly corrected proposals made to them.
Secret of Complex Shaking Canada Uncovered
The new American diplomatic leaderships spread through WikiLeaks uncover the secret of what the United Nations considers under the Canadian inferiority complex toward the Americans, but with the same blow they reveal the feeling of superiority toward Canada more recently named.
Consequently, American diplomats are astonished that the Canadian voter does not mean Canadian-American relations during the vote, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were released publicly yesterday, offer even more sharp details than the mere substantial content you have to scratch.
A link dated September 22, 2008, that is, during the period in which the federal election campaign was in full course, reports at which point the United Nations no longer participates in the missions discussed by its political leaders.
To the great amazement of David Wilkins, the American ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers several ways to explain this situation.
“A nearly Canadian-inherent minority complex may cause Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than pushing the United States back to black Peter in this election (such as in 1988 in the free trade campaign),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him.”
The ambassador understands this "ear-drowsing silence" even less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logically,” he assesses, “should it be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor at the polling station.”
The other expression of this sense of importance can be seen in the communication sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, managing director in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Their journey will help ensure the government’s continued existence in the federal budget vote in early February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade arising from a $30-40 billion revival program,” Breese said.
He had nowhere mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continuing existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another message, dated January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, emphasizes Washington’s increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or even kidnappings for purposes of CIA-based interrogations.
Another news release detailed how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to accept certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed over to the Secretary of State a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, let’s note that the minds about the WikiLeaks website are warming up.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close-standing consultant Stephen Harper, had declared on CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He spoke about Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for renewal of lighting
The UN yesterday in Cancun proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction (GHG) equivalent to nearly a third of the additional reduction that needs to be implemented in order to stabilize the Earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of compelling reduction obligations of the developed countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the CFC released to the earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white-burning pears, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or even better, light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the exhaust gases of the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major exhaust emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to screw down global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it would still have to deduct 5 Gt from this balance sheet to stabilize climate growth by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-burning pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produces the light.
With the compact light bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced again by twice.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those released by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company has participated in the UN study by the way - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-burning bulb, giving an indication of the savings opportunities of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely novel bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistance.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except that the producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal power plants, which emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-burning bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report describes in detail the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year on the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants, which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion dollars to build.
Ivory Coast Expects Announcement of Election Results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after their deadline.
“The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the independent election commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay,” said a press spokesman.
“He calls on all parties and institutions in Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the preliminary results.”
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight passed three days after Sunday’s election, without publishing the results.
Approximately forty minutes before the deadline expired, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, several calls from all over the world were made for the CEI to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections under Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the cancellation of “fraudulent” votes in the north by the Constitutional Council achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN’s manoeuvres to intimidate voters in the north of the country had discouraged the president’s supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo’s complaints were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo’s opponents are now more of the view that the country’s supreme court is not neutral as it is led by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who deny any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in the announcement of the election results as “unacceptable” and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His partners reaffirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has lost; and filing a complaint to the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results is illegal.
The second round of Sunday’s presidential elections were held for the crowning of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that has been split into two parts for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible in the event of possible riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of the election on October 31 with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the provisional, seasonally adjusted data published Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the involvement of overseas departments.
Over the course of the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
More in-depth view, 3.4 million employees in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter but wanted to find a job, including whether or not they were working every two weeks or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the inclusion of overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of the young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, saw a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months as well as over the year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, 6.6% with the involvement of overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a discussion on its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical office, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% quota in France for October (including overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) General Council, was investigated and was sent to prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into public markets suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with abuse of corporate assets, misappropriation of general goods, hideousness, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and weapons possession, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecutor's office will ask him instead of spreading brain madness."
“It’s easy to submit a number of criminal charges to him, another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, the brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had emphasized to send a memorandum to the judge before his hearing through his lawyers to justify him.
A relative of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than keeping his landfill running.
Regarding the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds, he would never have been aware of, Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged on Wednesday with undermining and complicity, but then under the requirement of keeping himself away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him."
"The chief prosecutor has considered not to deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and released from prison on Tuesday night to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, Deputy Supreme Attorney Michel Raffin said.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the waste disposal facility Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two officials of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one for the title "Intrusion and misleading of the general public by a public service officer" and the other for "Committee in misleading of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "deceitfulness and subjugation of societal assets".
Among the persons confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned for a similar case of fraudulent public actions that had affected Corsica.
The perpetrators suspect his company of helping to launder money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public procurement, in particular in the disposal sector, will be carried out in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses particularly on the conditions of the tender and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the region of the Aubagne, as well as from certain cities in the urban basin area of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Riss: Elysee Palace exaggerates its intermediary role for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was detained in Iran for "espionage", breathed the French public into alarm and emphasized the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive eyes of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained from WikiLeaks and searched by the newspaper Le Monde reveal some backgrounds of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to Americans who went so far as to give these advice on how to deal with their own crisis of “hostage taking” in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not provide the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner held in France and sought by the American judiciary because of trade in material for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media in order to make them credible the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss in a bright light.
In truth, he did nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic programme published in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French commentary on how to deal with hostage taking".
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method.
They advised the Americans to do everything possible to bring back their own nationals who were forcedly detained in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "basic human rights", "innocence", "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
“Do this even more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do this.”
Because "Still Silence Solves Nothing", past the attempts to discuss on unobtrusive paths, the Iranians are "Masters in Avoidance Maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "common, Iranian tactic": "hostage for the purpose of political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on August 16, the day she fled to the French embassy) "demands the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (€230,000 deposit).
And he makes it clear that Elysée anticipates further hostage taking, a phenomenon that will "aggravate itself."
"The Iranians could arrest another of the 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still detained in Iran.
Information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States demands to Iran for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison after a judge in Paris decided.
The U.S. Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which tracks the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the materials provided for the nuclear program.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of a re-talk with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to revolt against it.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under the “strict” supervision of the French intelligence agency.
The Elysée consultant picks a phone number, re-lays, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "currently is in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysee does not spare its efforts to make believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential media role."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and note that the manipulation bears fruit as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 summons "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is based so much “thanksgiving” to Mr. Assad, the Parisian message wonders.
“Despite their statements of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did.”
The document then deals with the reasons that caused the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intense communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which was then "perceived as premature and undeserved by numerous critics in France as well as abroad."
"The Syrian role is building up" Paris "trying to show Syria what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
It also aims to “sow division between Syria and Iran.”
The American embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier had entrusted her: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them for everything."
“This should at least create confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her in the Elysee.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriots".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law, called the Ashbrook, which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
A bill that calls on online gaming operators to deny young people under the age of 16 access to these games after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, depicted representatives of cult and family ministries.
“Many kids play these games all night and then have difficulty learning at school and also having a normal life during the day.”
“We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, Ministerial Representative of the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturers would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government also intends to ask the manufacturers to screw down the daily limit of time granted to access these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intense internet usage.
The country is also an undisputed champion in world-wide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
2018-2022 World Championship: FIFA appoints the host country
In strong excitement over suspicion of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political election in which the ranking for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria in the background.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to gain new territories (Catar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to track its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the measure of the economic and political commitment of a world championship.
The operations behind the scenes threaten to end up until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to hold the World Cup once, namely 1966.
On Monday, the BBC renewed its feeding ground by broadcasting a documentary report that targets three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough reason to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who had primarily done intensive lobbying with David Cameron over the past few weeks.
The leader hopes for a re-edition of his predecessor Tony Blair's chess train, which scored for London's 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Would this intense effort suffice to upgrade the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack the clumps with its already finished stadiums, his expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and his soccer culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible retaliation against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the file (stadiums, hotels, transportation) has become a weighty outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the unavoidable indication of the English press' accusations of "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by committee members.
“You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, headquarters of FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s highly anticipated 2026 World Cup grant to China, which overturns Asia’s chances for 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the waiting for futuristic stadiums, FIFA continues to expand toward new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weak television rights gained by European countries (due to the time shift), the delicate nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: obviousness
De Gaulle had really done it.
Mitterrand had made him believe he was stunning.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But obviousness is not well seen on the side of the mystery that adhers to the presidency function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt remains.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, the supporters of Jacques Chirac argued that a third mandate was not excluded without believing it.
On November 15, Sarkozy assured in serious tone that he would make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011".
That he would have the prospect of "two mandates" on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians had spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidature?
A lot missing.
The President merely reminded us that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have seven and a half years with me at worst, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase afterwards."
His words from yesterday make him no longer a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
Should they cause comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidature with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal that Nicolas Sarkozy is pushing to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidature in 2012, which warns many members of the PS earlier than expected to fight.
Poor polls on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidature for François Fillon than for Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
“We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it,” the Prime Minister’s environment responded immediately and carefully.
"If he found a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always believe that he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has refused to be obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to retain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to showcase opportunities for getting out of the crisis, or at least announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt is obliged, and the central bank in Frankfurt is undoubtedly not able to afford to inflict even today’s situation on European bond markets more than tense, in order not to cause their aggravation.
The political costs would be far too high.
On the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in solving Europe’s government debt.
She has not dared to say whether she believes that the central bank can do more, for example by boosting her program of purchases of state bonds.
"I retain my considerations for my European trading partners (...).
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the occasion of his hearing in Brussels by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament on the day before, had shown not very focused on his plans, but is content to point out that the programme of purchases of government papers on the secondary market would "continue to operate" and that we at the Assembly on Thursday "will look like the decisions".
Only certainty: the ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s Treasury’s bond purchases doubled last week to about 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretion of some traders, it is said that yesterday it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers.
Overall, since May 2010, the Eurosystem’s central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion.
Among the dealers, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a further tracking of the purchase price (see page 29).
Economists are no longer expecting a remarkable change of course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will continue to generate unrestricted money reserves in a free way, for a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already considering that this measure will be extended for a few months.
“I can’t imagine that the ECB will change its program in a substantial way.”
“Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," predicts Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchases of bonds that stimulates the slow market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of public debt in the eurozone, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“She must go to the placers of the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the urgency of enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states,” an important bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates started to fly higher, states would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or even just stabilizing it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government is covered in Italy
After a worrying start of the week for Italy, the situation yesterday has relaxed a little with the decline in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional president Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and had expected him to have a "unpredictable" weekend, which he immediately denied.
On Tuesday, at least, the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, leading to some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi told his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates is at 400 base points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed "serious concern" about the "market turmoil" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain terms, this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, vertiginous tax incomes that put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The recent Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget present at the Senate for review is expected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (contrary to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence, the riot about a new budget collective, which could be deployed to a sum of 7 billion euros after the holidays.
“If necessary, new austerity measures need to be taken,” says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently supported by international institutions.
“The foundations of Italy’s economy are fine and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"There are no problems at the moment, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.D.R.) from Italy is demanding lower stabilization progress than from other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of distrust by the House of Representatives, as a result of which the preferred elections could be organized already at the end of March.
Thus, there is a little favourable period for decision-making in the face of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said: "I think it was proven on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans are clearly standing together, ready and committed to defend their currency and monetary territory."
Although completely relative, the deduction yesterday in the interest rates of European state bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, it is not yet possible to talk about the beginning of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor’s announced that it could lower Portugal’s debt record, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly affected by banking systems," the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas said.
Especially because “political time is going much slower than markets.”
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger hidden in it, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the finance ministers most directly affected and in the broader sense with their G20 counterparts are proceeding well.
And this is also the case with the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan, the lot of unconventional measures to reinforce the back of the eurozone countries is at the thread cross of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, has already started his Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the ground for it.
The first advertising paper expenditures by the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative had entrusted the agency to Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilized by the IMF’s additional, direct engagement.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first row, are committed to implementing structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that will be added to the austerity measures but will have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are going a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other at all costs is to avoid having to seek international assistance before they set up their own budget corrections and have decided on inevitable structural reforms that will restore their trust in the long run.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the normalization process of government bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on a transit in Paris on 24 November, had first brought forth the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take back into its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market for European public debt as a key player, judge that an extension of 100 billion euros would suffice, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This fund exists: the European financial stabilization mechanism, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every opportunity to be carefully examined in European capitals.

Snow and Glacier: 24 departments in Alarm Level Orange
The snow episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alert level Orange due to the threat of snow and smoothness.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in alert level Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow thunderstorms tangle the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are significant enough to cause traffic impairments and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are blocked for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to traffic officers, who refuse to use their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER travel buses has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
Wednesday evening there were no specific restrictive measures for heavy traffic.
The prefecture "requests drivers to be extremely careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) urged airlines on Thursday to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly due to expected heavy snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in southern London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France has been in full swing, it has rained billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is to be remembered.
To initiate the construction of the SGP, the state has announced a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to lend a portion of the financial sum to its double on the markets.
Today, we have finally made the first predictions.
The Supplementary Budget of 2010, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly’s Finance Commission, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first portion of these funds.
These are two types of measures: the introduction of a special tax for opening up and higher taxation of offices on the Ile-de-France.
The first, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favor of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is calculated: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year."
The second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not included in the text.
Of the 4 billion you are far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation, which will be applied by the state and gradually allocated to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," explains the statement.
In the SGP, this system is not at all offensive.
"From the moment you record revenue (the two taxes, the R.), you can cover the project for over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, which has been promised 4 billion dollars to be sought for a long time, runs the risk of sparking a quite moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Revenge-addicted hackers and emerging spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of fakeness that governs the relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move forward.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence service (a x-whole nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper excerpts.
The "extraordinary" American disclosures about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what has been read for months in any x-journal anyway (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly cartooned profile of Gaddafi has been offering their cabaret artists for longer time.
The rule, according to which the secret files may consist only of already known news, is essential for the dynamic of the intelligence services, and not until this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to Esotheric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosary Crusaders) repeats exactly what has been written in previous works.
This is not just because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (not even because he knew where news about the non-existent could be found), but because those who are dedicated to occultism believe nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
The same is true of the secret records.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Liberation), who only considers what he recognizes to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a revocation made about the disclosures of these files?
On one side, these say what every educated person already knows, that the embassies – at least since the end of World War II and since then also the leaders of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner – have lost their diplomatic function and have, with the exception of a few small representative tasks, turned into spy centers.
Any spectator of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not for falsehood that you are doing so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of falsehood and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-willing hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world’s most powerful country is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Furthermore, the scandal brings less victims, rather than the "Scharfrichters" into distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the deep nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell’s time, one could bundle all power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have since turned out to be perfectly correct, where every motion can be controlled through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one takes into account what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be unilateral and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker – chosen as the avenger of the citizen – can uncover the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secret, as it reveals any public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, revealing the secrets of Hillary Clinton was to be revealed.
WikiLeaks has not wronged Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this offense inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that the states will no longer make any reserved information available online in the future – that would be the same as a hang on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies it is in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential phone reports secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained for certain ears only in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds science fiction and romantic, but I see myself compelled to imagine the government agents moving secretly on uncontrollable marching routes, carrying their communications nowhere else but in mere memory, and in addition the few written information they have received in the text.
The information would be stored in a single copy in sealed drawers: basically, Watergate’s espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology nowadays is progressing like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructed a telegraph with (phone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled film researchers to explore a film tape by tape by coiling from the back to the fore and unraveling all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
High-speed trains take three hours from Rome to Milan, while it takes three and a half hours by plane including transfer.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communications technology come back to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
Currently, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France makes its financial promises beautiful
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the fulfilment of the rapidly settled financing promises (also called "fast start" or premature financing) that have been realized by the developing countries.
And the rough French speeches have already been uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have undertaken to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million a year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of its commitment to fast-start financing: a detailed action report of its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its actual value: developing countries and civil society would like to see it if all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
In 2010, the EU announced that it released 2.2 billion euros, leading it to the right path toward improving its commitment of 7.2 billion euros in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort has been made without being to the detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, everyone chooses the right value they consider best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen itself as a benchmark for that of 2009: the international financing will be maintained, and will contribute 150 million for over three years as part of the "fast start" funding.
Other countries have chosen similar guidelines, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France was of the view that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no guidelines for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the overall amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France claims to meet its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule about this yet, and everyone chooses their computing mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 € borrowed as equivalent to 1 € donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to accept: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (frequently emission-restraining projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro collected as an equivalent of a donated euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be accounted for as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of one).
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% of 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) are 100% fulfilling their commitments with donations.
In other words, when the overwhelming majority of the European Union spends €1 on fulfilling their obligations, France only gives 10 cents and understood a comparable commitment.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in negotiations, since the developing countries do not allow themselves to be completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question in a relatively short period of time compared to the whole of climate discussions.
But there could be too much of the drops in the immense machinery of UNFCCC.
Let’s hope that this won’t be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its type of accounting for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and balanced justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could push the discussions on the subject matter of the long-term financing forward (a different, decisive and currently discussed issue): one does not escape the question of the "responsibility" or the type of accounting of its loans.
France could change its position to be just as progressive with regard to disputes as it is with other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement of France's fast-start and its vision of "responsibility" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes 81 different chemicals over the course of day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which declares that its findings "given the small number of analyzed samples do not represent a statistically significant value, but rather represent an illustrative character of the problem treated," had bought between July and September the foods usually consumed within four, from about a ten-year-old child to meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals – including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day – were examined as well as laboratories’ shops for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is depressing: 81 chemicals, including 42 classified as possibly or possibly carcinogenic and five classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrinin disorder, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
“Even if in the nearest number of cases the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, the survey shows very well that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrinine disorders is worrying,” the association notes.
Already at breakfast alone, butter and tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a meal for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, including lunch, in which the study found traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
Furthermore, the chip steak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemicals were picked.
In the tap water, the analyses brought to light the presence of nitrates and chloroforms.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 detected chemical residues was the "most rich", and even the plastic plate used to warm the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The ultimate risk of this “pollutant cocktail” for consumers “is likely to be underestimated,” the study said.
The "Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "growth in civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 residues of different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
