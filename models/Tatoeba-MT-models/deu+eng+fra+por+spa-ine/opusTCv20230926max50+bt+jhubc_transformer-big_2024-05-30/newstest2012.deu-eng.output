No Liberating Novel for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today declined the request to abolish the paragraph on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted in a Criminal Code amendment.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned former Prime Minister, the deputies rejected at the second reading of the request to mitigate the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly adverse agreement with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet enforceable, and the appeal of the convicted will be tried in court in December.
Timoshenko himself describes the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial caused suspicion of the court’s prejudice.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted, to remove from the Criminal Code was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council recognized the customary law of the Shari<0xCA><0xBF>a, of which one has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you are shortly hacked off your hand.
Even women should forget thoughts of emancipation as quickly as possible, any apostles of the faith will be executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society will be united by the Qur’an from mutually-conflicting tribes in the future.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that is hardly imaginable in this country and, above all, would not be desirable.
Only - our lifestyle isn't the only one and objectively not the best, and change would hardly fit the aforementioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were allowed to be helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their excuse may only serve the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not led by any general from America, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a shot change, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without this having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to avoid a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals unleash a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
Do the petroleum companies get black gold at a ridiculous price without occupation?
It is hardly possible that the West can finally, rightly, boast of its selflessness when it comes to the protection of human rights.
Unless they do not destroy the Shari'a representatives.
The Beginning of a New Crisis Era
France and the rest of Europe are the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm deep through Europe.
The individual states published their GDP data for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France.
The bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts of economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany’s GDP grew 0.5%, while France’s GDP grew 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany saw a higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% rather than predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated and according to the Statistical Office, the trend of slow growth in economic performance was thus confirmed.
So the results are worse than the analysts’ forecasts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
In the entire euro area and the EU, between July and September, the economy saw 0.2 percent growth compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2% compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year state bonds increased to 28.45%.
The returns of Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical boundaries.
Also Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are beginning to experience problems...
The return on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even if the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, votes are loud that the ECB should become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has accomplished the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well opened goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal of Petr Jiráček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will again not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the Ascension game in a detailed reporting.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won with a 1:0 luck thanks to the weaknesses of the home team, a brilliant Čech’s and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro, thus redeeming their ticket for the soccer EM.
Also because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they could only put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half.
The pech birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who fired two giant chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be mixed in the European Championships next year, it is also delightful that a premium of about 200 million will flow to the home football.
From the first few minutes there was a lot of fighting football.
Both teams combined long and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Even in the second half of the season, the pressure of the home team remained out and the wide defeats before the penalty space were successfully repelled by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country’s core program.
They were a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed noon before the object on Tuesday and then announced death to the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan in Iran on Tuesday formed a vivid shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is being processed.
They wanted to show that they were willing to protect their country’s core program, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran has apparently not given up on its efforts to build a nuclear weapon.
Israel also talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the US and Israel.
In the event of an intentional attack to shut down the Iranian nuclear program as much as possible, according to the Israeli press, the nuclear enrichment facility in Natan’s target would also be located at the center of Isfahan.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: it does not have breakfast and eat sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important the environment in which he grows up is for the healthy development of a person and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more common on the table than in families where children with normal weight live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had dinner potatoes the day before the enlightenment campaign under the motto “Obesity is not a coincidence.”
In families with thickers, sport is not one of the favorite activities, but the majority of today’s students – only 15 percent responded that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools in the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was already the second year of the action "Obesity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy eating and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the terrifyingly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
“Only half of the children surveyed, for example, suggested eating breakfast-lunch-second breakfast-vesper evening bread five times a day – one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet,” one of the survey results said.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that also relative little things, such as the family’s regular breakfast time, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students’ families eat breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
The worst was the finding that in every tenth family there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the foundation of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test revealed, among other things, that in families of overweight children, unhealthy potatoes are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70%)
Although more than 40 percent of children surveyed do sports, less than half of their parents do so – that is, only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own dining schedule from the options offered by appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many flour dishes, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet lemonades," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main dish, dough beat shortly before poultry.
Legumes the children almost did not like and also the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get proper information.
"In the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after the enlightening lecture "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was a significant shift in preferences towards healthy eating principles in many cases," the results of the project stated.
This was eye-catching, for example, with the sweet limes, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed in the questionnaire much more often poultry or fish as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat fewer knobs or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about learning stylists, I had a little tasted that this was a little too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know at the very least what's coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the pitch" goes.
It's going to get worse.
The closer the exam is, the more information and practical tasks are ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (no one man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportioned figure.
And that's most of us, after all.
Some have a too short neck, the others a too young figure without proper curves, and again others are molly.
It is the stylist’s job to visually cover wide shoulders, extend the neck or enchant the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to attract a woman like Jennifer Lopez - with a large breast, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figurine-betont without her appearance too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really don’t fit, you should be tailored at least one piece.
You will certainly not regret that, because well-sitting clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the bar, which always slides up and down, stands in the waist, etc.
In turn, young figures can allow themselves to wear clothing with wrinkles, folds, applications, embroidery or rafting.
With this amount of information and figure types, I am happy that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my mind thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid that it's almost unable to do it in the light of the homework applied.
In fact, each of the students was assigned a celebrity for which they should create suitable outfits - daywear and dinner robe.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its character type.
I'm supposed to "dress" Miranda Kerr, you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I juble, because that’s much better for me personally than, for example, dressing Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who probably has increased to a hundred pounds in recent years (well, that’s a little overwhelmed), or even young Selena Gomez.
The clothing is to be cut out of magazines or searched on the Internet, printed and then graphically edited.
In the "moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to think about the graphical side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also shapes the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But it's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was equal to three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a stylist can work with a single piece of clothing in different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, such as a t-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or collar and the whole look looks quite different.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But the most important advice I received was: “First, you must know the rules perfectly.”
"Then you can hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally I realize why we have to pause all these teaching sentences, what to combine with what and why, even if you often see quite different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So you have to be prepared for a ten-page fashion story (that is, ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So you have to count on all this when designing the outfit.
That image and style sometimes make up half the success, Jan Pokorný also confirmed.
All you have to do is see Madonna, a not just brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, one is more reserved than the services of a stylist.
Even well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something as I look at it is secondary).
And if someone of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose on us a whole different (small) size than he or she actually needs.
Then you only need to google to determine with certainty that the bulletin press writes that the corresponding celebrity has increased or decreased again, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must primarily communicate with the people he styles and he must be a gracious psychologist.
Assess people without offering themselves and standing in their opinion.
"If any manager asks us to look at her wardrobe and add some pretty pieces, then we can't clear her the entire wardrobe and say - my God, that's awful."
“You have to find at least a few praiseworthy things to recommend what you can wear,” says Mario.
He also showed us quite concretely what a so-called "square bag" must include.
So a bag that you knock on the waist and in which you carry all the necessary properties with you.
Besides clear things such as scissors, rollers for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are not stitched naturally if it is too large (spoke needles or other clamps with them).
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick footwear properly.
Even when photographing in the studio where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We were stuck and stuck...
You should not even touch the shoes with the scissors, so that you don’t damage them.
So you really have to be clever.
Mario delighted me in praising my "creation" without restrictions.
This skill is not exactly my strength.
All of this was just a fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation course.
I have now realized one thing: devoting myself to styling at a professional level is not a game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - The Illegal Race across America
Reviews
The originally careless ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettant errors to the routine ride to the early class.
It was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, but what’s the benefit of it when no one obviously wanted to do a little more.
Even before it came to the store tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" awakened high expectations.
He promised to move the old-fashioned game series "Need for Speed" back to a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples it didn't seem to be just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fitted passages in which the main protagonist climbs out of the car and goes on foot.
But as you’re already used to NFS, in the end, it’s much different than you expected.
Sure - potentially it's fairly decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some superfluous mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So they are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a laziness in principle of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
For the first time you are introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has some personal problems; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel with the task of being the first to be in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race will be held on a different track and that the individual stages will take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don’t have the impression that the game would offer the same thing again and again.
Some environments are still very beautiful to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the ride through the desert, through autumn landscape or high up through deeply snowy landscape seems visually very pleasant.
Sometimes untypical elements bring a bit of variation to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts your sight.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
On the other hand, the individual races are built up quite well in a row.
Just a few, but they're enough.
For a while you try to surpass the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
The police are also involved, who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages where Jack leaves the car.
It is more about certain interactive animations where Jack flees from anyone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are much fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (specifically only three).
Ultimately, this is rather an advantage of the thing, because so at least this element has no chance of getting bored - it is one of the elements that make the game more varied in the context of the above.
The driving model follows the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today’s point of view, it doesn’t tear out trees, but on the other hand it couldn’t be said to be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look around elsewhere.
But a race loaded with actions will continue to meet the local driving model quite well, although you could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is in order.
Real problems arise only after a certain time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
It is hard to expect from a game of this kind that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea before any impact on any object how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: When you overtake or pass cars that meet you "strip" the other cars in some places only slightly, but in other, almost identical situations, you get into sneaking and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the car will go straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn’t matter any more, but it’s always annoying.
The restarts are so resolved: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last point of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
When you've exhausted them, everything starts from the fore.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something fails, but you shouldn’t rely on it.
Sometimes, however, even the restart doesn’t help, because nothing else helps than learning the critical section from your head.
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don’t get through.
Somewhere else you will always meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you are the first or the fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the opponent passing two cars in front of a game, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, because everything is designed to make this situation always close to your nose.
The counterparts have other advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and here again regardless of the time.
The craziest is at the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The counterpart must obviously overtake one here on devil come out.
And when he is before one, he of course takes the sight of you, so that you start driving your own car there a few times in Klump.
Clearly - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly misses the joy of the game.
And that’s a shame, because despite the simpler driving model, the game overall is quite entertaining and sometimes so loaded with action that you almost no longer know where one’s head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "fault" is - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boring can happen, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change during the race.
You should not overlook the gas stations on the track, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have just enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical rides, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the game history mode also goes the task mode (challenges) - that is, the races in the individual locations that you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also to gain experience points for your own profile, which is jointly for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, various items must be opened: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is simultaneously connected to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares its own achieved results with those of other players and also provides additional collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the last race in history.
Here you can get by car to a subway tunnel (minestly because), where you can run in the dark on the rails for a long time (minestly because).
Figures look at the tacho between 150 and 200 km/h (because of mine), but there suddenly comes a subway from behind and drives an uncompromising scrap.
In our editorial, we will probably argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designer or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
The more annoying it is that at some exciting moments, the frequency of retrieval slows down, and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
This, however, applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit you anyway.
The sound is so far OK and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to as wide a scale as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a-la created "from everyone something" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game wasn’t undermined by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have claimed with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But this is how the game looks unfinished.
It is a great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared to get these errors in your eyes with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has made the balance between the individual institutions feelable."
I didn’t expect such a hard war to burn out.”
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth and all to get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, started her speech at the Faculty of Law.
She already showed how serious she takes the motto "understanding and open about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied so many readers of the Legal Faculty of the University of Charles.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first criticism was loud that he was too unobtrusive – a gray official who didn’t fit such a role, but I have to say that it has breathed out to everyone how well he has accepted the matter.
“He is a man who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, communicate with them and, above all, has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is it actually - the European Union? What number should I call?", an important step towards the unification and better readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil-moutzers quargels
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda on which the European Union lived, lived and plans to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago, she described it as a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She called the case of the government during the presidency a major negative, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all the work to do.
In the words of the ambassador, not only the presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, was quite hectic.
And the EU's seven-year budget still needs to be approved, which makes the situation much more complicated precisely because of the current economic situation.
Whether it is going to be a slim and economic budget, which sectors are given priority, which countries are more supported and which are less supported, all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Comprehensible about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s grayish abbreviations, foreign words, and specialist jargon that no one understands.
How do I, as a citizen, really know if you really think of curvy or round cucumbers and different sized bananas in Brussels, or if someone really wants to ban us the quargels?
It would also have liked to use the soil of the EU to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
In the opinion of the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who perceive more of the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The more annoying is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
There are many factors to blame for this, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is near me, then the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what's your heads together - is this your V4 again?' and makes a pretty sour miene.
According to Mrs Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects, above all, tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As much more real, as a "European federation", she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
“We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute for strengthened cooperation.”
“For the first time it was said that only the countries that want to work together and those that don’t want to stand quietly aside.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Mrs Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle, according to which all issues with an impact on the EU as a whole must be discussed by all Member States and not only the countries of the eurozone.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, this would probably be the word “durability”.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its foundation.
Her first boss, visionary Thomas J. Watson sen, laid the foundation for this longevity.
Even he represented the slogan, countless global problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark for the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company-internal magazine, which began to be released at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and also succeeded for a whole century because it remained true to its principles and was not scared to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society throughout our first century.
We hope that we will achieve even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, today’s director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Conceived system
In the 1930s, Watson worked in social care for his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had paid vacation as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-thought-out pay system for the best newspapers and dealers.
Similarly, IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the very beginning - as one of the first companies in the world to stop any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan, which will be replaced by a woman at the head of IBM next year – Virginia Rometty.
She has been working with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken the position of Chief Operating Officer, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called online brainstorms, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, because nearly half a million people are employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both inside and outside.
“From the outset, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company,” said Economist, Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to only be present in the market or to directly shape it through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo for family name "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or even the disk.
With approximately $220 billion in stock value (market capitalization) this year, IBM was the second-largest technology company (equal to Apple), with it outperforming Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The eye forward
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today’s customers – unfortunate for example, trying to use their own OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on moving forward, so you shouldn’t be emotionally bound to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Successful technologies
One-fifth of the services, software and hardware each participate in IBM’s profits.
Hardware was still the most represented in 1990, with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-losing assets worth $15 billion, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in purchasing future-oriented technologies.
IBM continues in these investments even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis was the first time it was a storm over the world.
IBM remained faithful to the legacy of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment scope in the midst of the great world economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM will survive the current crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008 and the company’s net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed – only values cannot be changed.
This flexible giant can also be expected to overcome the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
The company IBM (International Business Machines), founded in New York a hundred years ago, initially had a rather complicated name – Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM company was the merger of four companies, whose history goes back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as the famous stitch-card watches for the registration of the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company became Charles Ranlett Flint, who was also chaired by the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader then even shadowed the founders of IBM - based on Watson's ideas, the company's invincible culture and identity is still based on today.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM started, as the name suggests, with the production and sale of all possible machines for retail – from sausage and cheese cutters to cashiers.
In the first four decades of Watson’s leadership, he doubled sales to nine million dollars and gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was in the chief chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped NASA to direct flights to space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969 also man's famous flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which established the computer standard of that time, was launched in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but acquired the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered into the business of consulting services and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the concept of “Smarter Planet”.
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a wise manner in areas not even planned so far, e.g. also to improve the situation in transport and city administration.
In the trading sector, IBM recently introduced the “Smart Commerce” platform, which is designed to help traders steer the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM founded a branch in the Czechoslovakia at the time – as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe Headquarters is located in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her spouse, Josef Rychtář (53) of the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) had become her lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would awaken from his pink dream and return home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the next life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered shelter to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she wouldn’t have even dreamed of what happened to her husband.
When Iveta moved back to <0xC5><0x98>íčany after 30 days on her urge, Joseph immediately went with her.
He even publicly acknowledged that he loved her.
With time, Darina resigned, and it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again – but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytář doesn’t care who his wife is sleeping with
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will surely receive his unopen arms at home.
“He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not drive him out.”
"But not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man with whom I still have certain ties," said Mrs. Rychtářová; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted on mutual decency alone.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door to him, Josef has been carrying it with dignity.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'm staying with Iveta, nothing changes."
“My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that.”
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I talk normally with Darina, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find herself a new love, then he doesn’t want to stop her from doing so.
“We don’t sleep with each other, so I don’t care if she has a friend or who that is.
I realize that it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and that’s why I take on all my responsibilities.
The worst female injustices: what about you?
When men are asked to name some typical female injustices, they will, without exception, shake some promptly out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognise yourself in the following lines, in which we rehearse a few unusuals that let men wave the blood in the veins?
Shopping addiction
Does your husband accuse you of being a shopping addict?
Do you need to buy at least one dispute per week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a bit more in promotions?
In your case, it’s really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their purchasing desire halfway under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman can already bear it, looking for a well-seated upper clothing just so to stroll through a clothing shop and not to try all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times you've told your husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Permanent Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too thick?"
"Should I have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or do gymnastics?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Does this seem familiar to you?
Oh, yeah?
Then you are likely to be one of the women who are really obsessed with how they look.
This doesn’t mean that you should let go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly complaining about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of discomfort, women are more and more untolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a battle against windmills.
Wipe windows, tiles and dust, wipe the bathtub - and at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner because he steps onto the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, do you blame the kids because the washbasin is so dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, where polishing does so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you should not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the first place.
Ultimately, this unmeasured purity can also harm mutual relations and, above all, peace in the family.
Stitching
"Dirty sneakers come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to wear the old socks again tomorrow?"
“A wet towel doesn’t just throw on the floor.”
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you shouldn’t be surprised that it will get him on the palm.
This is not badly meant, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need so much to mean.
Scratch and Scratch
Some women like to clap and pitch, they get screamed behind their backs or even slandered, or they forge alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to cheer through such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us has a little harmless gossip and crap in stock.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with screaming, to which nothing and no one is holy, who despise everyone in their surroundings and pose a significant danger to women’s collectives, especially.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Ice hockey player Jaromír Jágr played a big part in Philadelphia’s 5:3 victory on the ice in Carolina in the NHL Monday game with two assists, making him again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Benefits of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star were in both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was proclaimed the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's co-player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed to journalists after the game that he had prophesied Giroux a big evening.
"Before the game, I tell him that he's getting a hattrick today."
I felt that somehow.”
"Such a feeling comes over again and again," said Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Behind the hurricane gate, Voráček won the puck and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first-third whistle, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second-third then again belonged to the flyers.
Concretely Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love to play with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s certainly one of the top three,” Jágr said.
"I wouldn't have noticed in my life that at the end of my career I was playing with such an ice hockey player as I was playing with him."
"I'm so happy."
“I’m cutting my game on me.”
"All the years in the NHL, my co-players set their game on me, and now it's turning around," Jágr said.
Carolina turned the game into a drama - thanks to the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who perpetrated himself from a penal shot, came to a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in excess of two against one.
"Excellently performed Pronger still in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad that it worked out," Voráček described the last match from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia took the lead of the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and quit in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
Besides their experienced Beck, the Candians also lost their guidance in the penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the penalties could not transform Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high illness-related failure in the defensive - they played the game only with five defense players.
"That's bad."
"The encounter ended with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing that can be done, we have to do with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Whenever we changed, one wave of attack after the other and we had nothing to oppose."
We had to make the game easier and get the puck out of our third.”
There were still reserves here,” said P.K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec denied thirty shots from Tampa Bay, contributing significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters shared.
Evolution of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorized state travel agencies in the then-CSSR: Čedok, Sportist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies at the time only sold travel to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West only chosen people were allowed at the time.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea peninsula by the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A major paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the CSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then the travel agencies offered travel to the west, but then you had to buy huge queues or even stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This was not the way for a long time.
The so-called currency promise - the condition for a trip to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
Indeed, the Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a commitment to currency.
Most Czechs therefore spent their holidays in the country, no wonder the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and datches - a habit that continues to this day.
The 1989 velvet revolution followed a travel revolution by the Czechs.
While until 1989 a vacation in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their vacations abroad in countries around the world.
An enormous paradox, which is no longer aware of today, is the fact that you could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czechs today - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange duty was lifted in neighbouring Western European countries, which led to a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn’t get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymakers slept in the tent in the park when travelling to Paris, for who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a guesthouse at the time.
A typical feature of Czechs travelling abroad was then a trunk packed with canned, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech krone - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our living standards and the average wages increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began regularly preparing charter flights after 1997, making air travel incredibly cheaper than the past thanks to the ability to negotiate quantity discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already had currency-free payments with all the highly developed countries in the world, making traveling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-summary" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight was made to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly to distant sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flying directly from the Czech Republic.
The Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the era that characterized our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely ranked among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history spent more than 15 TZK per capita for a single vacation stay including the cost at the resort.
The General Meeting is expected to find a new chairman - a patt is threatened again.
For almost five months, Czech football has not been chairman, threatening that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general assembly on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is no agreement on which electoral order to be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three stakeholders want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned, asking his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that could lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old querels between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the general assembly had come to the House of the People’s House in the Smíchov district of Prague for nothing, because the trial did not result and it was not just about the election itself.
Indeed, it was not even possible to agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full assembly - only the statutory representatives or even the officials equipped with authority.
On this one point, at least partial agreement was reached, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute for the State and the Law, whose representation on the basis of authority, in the opinion, is not acceptable.
However, disputes about the electoral rules continue.
Nor did the Executive Committee bring any more clarity to the matter, at whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda at all.
Even though the views about the election changed a few times, the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is, how should one take action in the 3rd round to avoid a patt situation?
"The dispute is about whether to act in accordance with the statutes or whether to find a completely different model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairmen of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he candidates.
Moravia is allegedly willing to make a compromise that the candidate who receives the highest number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority at this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense at all, this mode would challenge the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would best not be to bend the electoral order, but to vote according to the valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees with this, even though it is noted that the statutory electoral rules are most likely to meet Pelta by all candidates.
"My wish is that it should be elected to the greatest extent in accordance with the statutes."
"So that no nonsense replacement variants are conceived like at the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who was running for the first time and was distinguished by Pelta in his statements.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new president will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the Football Championship today would certainly contribute to calming the minds."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is greater," says the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experience of all three adeptes, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more constrained.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately dubious."
“This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to ‘correct’ the regulations for their own purposes.”
“A re-blocking at the General Meeting is therefore not excluded.”
“However, I hope that healthy common sense will ultimately win,” Rajchl said.
Only - there is no longer much time to agree on all sides.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying game.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not start at all in Prague in the morning due to a technical failure and so they were feverishly looking for a replacement variant, such as bringing a part of the executive committee to the location of the dam hin game.
Ultimately, the meeting at the ministerial level, which is supposed to come on Wednesday, is likely to be decisive.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and Body Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the confidentiality of the Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which is to lead the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes to fight for the position of chairman because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general assembly, had been able to make a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have been involved in the struggle for this top position at all.
"If there were a good candidate, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such an adepte," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory he intends to exercise the function of chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general assembly.
In the chairman’s position, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who isn’t too engaged in football.
“I have spoken personally with some eligible people.”
“It’s hard to believe that some told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
“Such views would have liked to change,” he said.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disrupts Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation, who is considered behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general assemblies.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík to have Pelta hold the position of chairman.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and in Czech football it would not go forward at all."
“The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football,” Paclík said.
He also suggests that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with phone hearings to investigate a corruption case, but emerged from which Pelta was unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelta victory should bring to football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said in his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner Football Club if Pelta becomes chairman," but he sees a little more calmly.
However, if Paclík wins in the elections on Thursday, he can imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate - Rajchl, whom Paclík supported before the general assembly in October, which ended with a fiasco, also thinks.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
“He has great abilities.”
“I could imagine him as head of the national team, for example.”
“But I don’t think he’s able to lead the association as a manager.”
"I'm not getting into matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September had made him look up behind the dismissal of the referee committee with Luděk Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims he has grown up in the role of the chairman of the association.
Relying on his skills in managing private companies, since last summer he has also been the head of Pilsen, which with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the league.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to some cultivation of it.”
"To restrict the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which goes even out in disgusting situations," said Paclík, who does not make a leak of his antipathy to Sparta's chief Daniel Křetínský, for example.
One of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to the sport.
“This is one of the key things the new president should devote himself to.”
“If it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their arguments, but then they also have to clearly say where the money is going,” he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club also does not regard Paclík as a disability, although he himself emphasizes that the chairman of the FAČR must be "transpartisan".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
“That’s not ideal.”
"It doesn't make much sense either to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third party to return after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would lead to a patt situation in the future.
Two days before the general assembly of the football association, one of the candidates for the presidential office, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that he would make himself strong in the event of his election for the FAČR to obtain new statutes, which in the future exclude disputes about the electoral rules from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly be diminished if the Czech selection will eventually succeed.
Pelta had promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and winning funds in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general assembly and thus the two-month break helped him defend his ideas about the leadership of football and present them in a broader context.
“People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“He feels that it’s time for the association to be led by someone,” said the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonecer club, but who also served for many years at Sparta and in the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that for today’s problems with the election is responsible the euphoria that reigned in the times of Ivan Hašek.
“Unfortunately, at the General Meeting in June, statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they hadn’t allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman as of September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizens’ Association that he used as an appeal to the delegates.
"If I want to be president, I will take it personally and I am ready to bear personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
“That’s a principle thing without which he cannot be,” Pelta says.
Furthermore, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
Earlier he had announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education and he knows well that his counter-candidate would be his first deputy.
Even Tomáš Paclík had long failed to attack, which in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes.”
"His attacks, however, were degrading and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Therefore, too, many now doubt his true character," Pelta addressed his counterpart, who probably remains faithful to his proclamations he made in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest classes to the national team.
And this should be the blueprint of Czech football.
“I would also strive to end all affairs – from the Bohemians’ cause to the rehearsals of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“At the same time, I would go into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure adequate funding for the whole football,” the 46-year-old candidate ČTK said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the head of Czech football would not mean personnel cleansing.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work contents of all employees," he said towards Strahov, where the long anarchy understandably dominates nervousness.
Despite the ongoing catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
“If really the only controversial point is how to choose in the third round, we’ll get over it.”
“Football needs credibility and it will only win it back if it finally has a new leader,” Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR under him will begin to work hard
If the former deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl was elected as the new chairman of the Czech Football Association at the general assembly on Thursday, this would allegedly lose the mood to many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and blame the members of the executive committee for individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that previous president Ivan Hašek has begun.
“As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through national selection, professional football, to youth soccer performance.”
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in a conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I’m going to distribute tough tasks so that football can move forward in every segment with milestone.”
Many wouldn’t be excited about it because instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I have considered no longer candidacy at all.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don’t constantly throw sticks between my legs and question every step I take,” he said as an explanation of why he he hesitated.
“Many people told me I shouldn’t give up, otherwise others would do it.”
“That’s trust that you can’t lose,” he said.
He is also allegedly motivated to continue the work he began under Hašek.
“In two years, we have done a lot of work and I don’t want to just throw it away.”
"Proceedings have been started, and I wouldn't like to see anyone stop them in a few years," he said, expressing his concerns that in case the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
“I believe in systematic action and that’s something that Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
“Behind him are mostly people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen.”
I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for being partisan.”
“I’m trying to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone, because everyone is doing well and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
“Even though some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for Moscow.”
“For example, it’s time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then rose into the first league each time.”
"Then it couldn't happen that only three Moravian clubs play in the league today, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Now that the head of the Pilsner club, Tomáš Paclík, has joined the struggle for the role of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
“I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me,” said Rajchl, who also considers the savings of tens of millions of crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law to be his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the association not drawing on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta, "he's disqualified from the outset to help Czech football re-confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he did an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he were to be elected, he would probably continue the things Ivan Hašek initiated and obviously he would not fundamentally change the personnel occupation in the commissions."
He certainly wouldn’t want to bend things in his favor,” Rajchl judges of his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Plank pools in UFO-optics, pools in Budapest: travelers through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike, rest the tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a search trip in the past year and a half, one thing was not missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Laying back on the water, she looked highly in artfully designed dome, swimming up against marble pots waiting for her at the edge of the basin, and amazed at thoroughly restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
She liked a bath, she took it in her notebook on a flight - with details worth knowing about the building's construction and history.
More than 200 swimming pools were explored by architectural historian Meder - and now introduces her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore Concrete Buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and each one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports, she doesn’t have much on her hat, says Meder – only in the water is it different.
It’s only annoying that swimming fans have to deal with blue tiles and chlorine smell, while joggers can inhale the sweeping fragrance of spruce forests or listen to cheerful birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools should always be so ugly,” said the Vienna-based Meder.
“So I started collecting beautiful baths.”
Water surface doubles architecture
The spa factor in baths is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have put themselves in the effort, swimming halls can be a real eye appeal: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building.
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, jump boards.
The small-format tape "Badefreuden" conveys on 190 pages interesting information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but above all makes a desire for a jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a pittoresk karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath filled with alkali-containing water and located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálmfür).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you can watch the entire city from the Zurich rooftop bath, you can look at the snowy Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe driving on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathing guests in Längenfeld: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three open bowls, it vaporizes in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal Valley move into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in any swimming pool, the pool collector Meder's smell of chlorine rose into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, in the Árpád bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells so strongly like heating oil that you hardly believe you have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose slic sticks to the skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful swimming spots: when she wanted to visit the free and sunbathing in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bathroom, designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902, has now been closed.
When Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weed growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decay has been counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath has three construction phases behind it; you can discover not only neo-Romanic elements dating from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of the pool shower Iris Meder - and not only because it originated in the Black Forest.
“It’s already a performance to merge such different styles into such a great unit,” says Meder.
In such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a secondary thing.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets commodity business shine through
By Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO wants to have consequences.
Hamburg -
According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions leave this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving prices up - and therefore the banks are responsible for the global hunger problem.
The Consumer Protection campaign is aimed specifically against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material bets were intended to secure traders against price fluctuations.
However, nowadays most experts agree that the zockers have disconnected from supply and demand – and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike U.S. competitors, Ackermann reacted to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said no business is "worth putting the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank at risk."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is currently reviewing the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year the audit is to be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of directors of the Deutsche Bank - along with recommendations on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to tell what consequences it is drawing.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity business, or even the complete reversal.
Ackermann works on his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on rising food prices shows particularly dramatically how ruthlessly banks are harming the general good today."
Ackermann is now particularly in duty as the top banking lobbyist.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether it's about people suffering from hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes surprisingly at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO will not change to the Supervisory Board unlike planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses he hardly needs to cut himself - that would eventually have to do with his successor.
One in two would cancel raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute surveyed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 11 percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that are wagered on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would cancel all investments where money flows into commodity speculation, according to the survey.
43% would discourage acquaintances from such a bank, 49% said they thought about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won awards in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and went away.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, brave swings and new building materials are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer is a good and famous example for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and floating steel-glass construction.
To this day, the building is considered a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion at the next World Exhibition in Austria.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like side building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South Railway Station, rebuilt and opened a museum of the 20th century in 1962 - the "20er Haus" was called it.
But the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has come down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a luck in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, an art historian with a remarkable career, graduated from youth as an ice skater, later at Sotheby’s, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, focused on the transformation of politicians and monumental guardians, raising public funds and private sponsors.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a cafe and a bookstore, and an office house had to be built to do so.
Strict supervision, small state
For the implementation, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna sensitively and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was a "monsterly important place" for him, where he had watched the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost generosity and ease as soon as it was moved to Vienna and reused.
There were far greater problems with the current conversion: the building was "an energy scrap", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was inserted and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been restored.
Two basements provided space for new use, a lowered light pit between the house and the street ensures exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the lightweight dick pavilion.
The original outside doors have remained, the house is painted in the old red brown rust-proof colour.
The cinema is exactly as it was before.
And all this under the strict supervision of the Monument Authority and with a small budget.
"Often we had to find a material that is good and cheap and also liked the Office of the Monumental Protection," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It had been difficult with the pavilion that “comed from Brussels,” Krischanitz recently said, a typical “drop-in-the-city history.”
Such an architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "raise a real awareness".
In this case, however, the 21st house has not been in the wrong place, because there has been a urban luck: around the Swiss garden is the entirely newly planned "main railway station quarter", with office and residential buildings.
And another luck might happen: the 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she already negotiates with the city for a neighborhood location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in millions
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, according to a newspaper report, Deutsche Bahn spends more than 70 million euros this year.
The Bild newspaper reported in advance, citing a corporate crisis plan, that investments of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This is intended to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snow removal on railway systems and railway platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to free the platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operations and 90 percent of the operational necessities.
Two months ago, Railway Chief Rüdiger Grube warned of train failures and delays this winter after a top meeting with government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had serious problems in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years to be approved by the Federal Railway Office.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been creating for years that it must have axles of ICE trains checked significantly more frequently in the workshop after an ICE at Cologne Central Railway Station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank Pays Million Penalties in the US
After the tumult over Chef Josef Ackermann comes new distress from the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now getting his past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison $145 million (106 million euros) to resolve disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of large banks of inducing cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have lowered the risks.
Such papers lost significantly in value during the financial crisis and took the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court," a spokesman for the Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The bank did not acknowledge any blame with the comparison.
The same applies to Citigroup, which pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chair Debbie Matz welcomed the reception of the two cash houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and is taking action in bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billion-dollar damages that have been incurred.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
In the summer, JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs sued.
The mortgage-backed securities are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are underlying home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this became deadly for a large number of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even though the events have been a few years ago, a sharp wind is currently blowing against the banks in the US.
Investors and regulators have initiated countless lawsuits to obtain reparation or punish faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of lawsuits.
She accuses 18 international large banks of overtaking two US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions of around $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit by the FHFA, with several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters face "substantial losses" without mentioning an accurate sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unreasonable and declared it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could only be poorly predicted.
However, he has now read IBM’s annual reports and changed his views on investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM is primarily providing services and creating computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight’s strike in the financial world.
As a result, the IT emergency stone IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed to CNBC that he has been buying IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM hadn’t known anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which even during the economic crisis had provided adequate profits.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said.
IBM has been relying for some time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful corporate computers.
Buffett had rather avoided technology companies to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett accessed a freight railroad, lubricant manufacturer or machine manufacturer.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway also holds shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with clever investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost untrue sense of earning money has brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s share increased by one percent in the pre-trade market.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also known, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he didn’t want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now reviving.
The killings of eight Turks and a Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is responded with fear and anxiety in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, a long believed dead ghost returns: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
Nevertheless, the existence of alien hostility in Germany was never questioned.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet foreseeable.
"Does the bloody ideology revive?" the Turkish newspaper's Internet issue "Haberturk" titled.
The newspaper "Sabah" emphasizes, on the other hand, that one of the perpetrators was supposed to have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community reacted wisely to Germany: it reminded the victims of racist violence on the weekend with a memorial guard outside the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had planned to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colours, the co-operation had been staged – as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media: "Germany's Gift for the Fiftieth" is like a whip, the headline of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Nor can the German edition of the "Hürriyet" be taken away from drawing this thought-related connection.
"It's starting to smell," is the title of Ahmet Kulahci's column.
He emphasizes that people have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish internet forums, the actions of the police and their subsequent search success are being discussed extremely critically.
The authors wonder why the German authorities were not much more likely to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some people are at least rhetorically prepared to use drastic means: “If we continue to scream here, there is nothing left for the migrants but self-defense and arms.”
“It will be the best self-protection.”
"On the goodness of enlightenment and adequacy of punishment of the entire network, the internal peace in Germany depends very strongly," writes Selen.
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s clarified.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the feeling of ourselves on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at the time, the failure of German politics after the attacks was mostly complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen, he sent a condolences telegram to the Turkish President, but was represented at the mourning ceremony in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech how many fees the Turks made.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his tax levies.
The current reporting by the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks has since been in the rule of law.
In addition to the efforts to extensively investigate and re-evaluate extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time it needs open words.
The scandal bank of the lake Zürise
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
In the financial crisis, UBS almost went bankrupt and has since been shifting from one crisis to the next.
Now a German should judge it.
Axel Weber didn’t think so.
Following his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would start an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS – an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidity and gave friendly comments about future colleagues.
"The UBS managed the turnaround.
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A merchant at UBS in London had bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and deployed some 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker famous not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS has also been dealt with - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber was allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he takes over the chairmanship of the board already in May – not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it’s going to be hard.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and a central banker and would certainly have needed an employment time.
With one blow, he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it has long deserved the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
Because on the one hand UBS is huge - until recently it was the biggest wealth manager in the world - and on the other hand has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, remains spared by the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the quiet and solid but also exhausted Swiss wealth manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she wanted to become a very large number in investment banking, too.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had advanced into the league of the world’s biggest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-term banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "I always presented the UBS to my students as a pattern of a good bank at the time."
“From today’s perspective, one wonders, ‘How could I be so wrong?’
He was greatly mistaken.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something had gone wrong in UBS.
In mid-year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, until then considered a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, he knew why he had gone.
The bank’s investment division had screwed up with subprime papers and had to deduct billions.
To stop this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
For this, she actually found investors, but some of which would have been overwhelmed until recently: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so hidden that it was not even known its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it was worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and in 2006 the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, Switzerland’s second-best-paid board, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: UBS faced the collapse due to its misinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced wall bond, through which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to house such large banks.
Finally, the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
“Once again, we couldn’t save the UBS,” says banking researcher Geiger.
The first disaster followed the second.
A few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have deceived taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these deals along with a penalty surcharge.
Thus, the UBS more or less openly acknowledged that it had helped in tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in competition for wealthy customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
Followed by the resignation of Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
In a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both core businesses: investment banking due to misspeculation and asset management through tax evasion aid.
And just as it became slightly quieter again, just as the UBS is now going to get it back, follows this unfortunate trader story: a single trader twists 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes something is going wrong.
And it becomes apparent: with risk management in investment banking, it obviously still doesn’t work.
“With the Adoboli case, we have found that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and financial professor at the banking institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not control risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had taken a long time ago to become guardians of the great wealth of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic the world once wanted to collapse.
The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
Already the location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main railway station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany’s can be found here between Swiss traditional shops like the Konfisserie Sprüngli.
For centuries Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy rotary door.
Inside the walls are marble-coated, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign on the "Safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has been dismissed by both Swiss large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point – or revealed how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds it.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he does business with the two big banks, like all Swiss bankers.
UBS has become much too large, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first gave it high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost so much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
“On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation,” writes author Lukas Heiß in his book “The UBS-Crash.”
Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion euros, were granted by politicians to save the large bank facing bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined together to form a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for the smaller Switzerland during the merger – and grew ever more.
In doing so, the two different precursor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on wealth management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized bank.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers got a lot of money to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest, who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man who has worked up from banking to the very top."
But Ospel finally relyed on Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were the reality,” says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragical, perhaps.
Of course, pride came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executives meetings, where Group Chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs throws off the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
UBS wanted to go to the top.
A few steps had already been successful.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, she was at the top.
However, business consultants who were hired highlighted a weakness: in the international interest deal, in the banker's language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost her existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund before it invested in American subprime investments.
It evolved into a massive machine that packaged and extended securities on American mortgage loans – but also kept risks itself.
Also, when other banks have long been looking for an exit.
“Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it,” says Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager after the other had to go than the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at UBS have become a slurry seat and remain wacky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the business models.
Banking researcher Geiger has an idea: ceasing investment banking, focusing on asset management, returning to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go so far (still).
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, new Chief Bank Officer Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has established himself: he should permanently run UBS business, Zurich Bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to go back to the mid-1990s.
3500 jobs are removed.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does she want to make money from?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask himself now.
So far he has only said that he and his wife will find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens U.S. exchange
The threat of recession in Europe has taken the courage of U.S. investors for the week’s opening.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The depressed industrial production on the continent suffocated hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the germ.
The general relief from the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass were still considered half-full last week, not half-empty – but now the problems were again pushed into the foreground, said Janney Montgomery Scott’s Mark Luschini.
In particular, financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones index of the default values noted at the closure of trade with a 0.6 percent minus at 12,078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer pendulated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.

In Frankfurt, the Dax sailed with a 1.2 percent decrease at 5985 meters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is adjusting to the end of the recovery.
The companies produced 2% less in September than the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We’re not an island, we’re dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to get rid of a recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
In his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the company’s stock price and initially made it note just one percent higher against the trend in trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America’s shares dropped by 2.6 percent more than the market.

Intelligent crows spread to cities
In many places, seed crows are considered “problem birds”: however, the highly intelligent animals can no longer be removed from the cities, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them quite quickly: crows have been part of the city for centuries, but in many municipalities local residents complain about the dirt and noise of animals.
A remedy for the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in East Friesland empty.
There, professionals from all over the federal territory advised on possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Natural conservationists also caused the problems in cities to escape from the countryside of the especially protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
The hunting, growing cultivation and the falling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are found in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project on the mass killing of crows in the district provided negative headlines.
Critics had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and the slaughter with sticks as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the grabbing, doesn't help," stated city and landscape designer Werner Klöver from Leer.
Nests spraying away with water or cutting down trees often have unwanted consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg said.
“The animals flee, large colonies divide and spread elsewhere.”
Injury can only be conceivable as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we can’t get them away anymore.”
Without the surroundings, the problem could not be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is possible to think of a combination of grace of animals from sensitive living areas and locks to resettle them elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, advocated for a completely different approach to the animals: "We can finally best endure a pimple on the face confidently."
In Schleswig-Holstein, Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, on which signs informed about the lives of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also on criticism of the noise of birds, Jürgens had his own opinion: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crows not only use tools to get a delicious bite, but even make their tools themselves as an aid.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a scaffold to collapse with stones in order to reach a moth larve.
Without much training, they determined the size and shape of a stone to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the pitchy crows had to solve a more complicated problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larve.
With the snail, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had put wire pieces on them.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded in doing so immediately.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal in 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will be present at the 2012 EM.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland solved the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect the fifth consecutive EM competition after the 0:0.
The Czechs scored a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back game at outsider Montenegro, after the game (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia also scored 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland scored a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72th, 82th) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trading meter (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65st) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Red Card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed to play off Portugal in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal took a tailor-made start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free kick from about 30 meters to lead early.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his far-shot qualities and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by goal-hunter Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English leader Manchester City put a headball on the bottom edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was at the center of attention.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic surely transformed.
But after the break, the 2004 Vice-European Champion made it clear with four goals.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubt in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European Championship races for the fifth time in a row to the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with Bundesliga legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a second in the initial phase.
Finalman Petr Cech prevented with a reflex at the last moment a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
In the 40th minute, Damjanovic shot from the penalty boundary just shortly past the gate of Cech.
After the break, the cross-latte for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs had to be saved, again the attacker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50).
The gate just before the end made everything clear.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink has almost certainly to leave his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup Third, the Croatians can be pleased with their fourth participation in a EM final round.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to sink the preacher in the gate.
But after the second of terror, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
Besides Mario Mandzukic from the VfL Wolfsburg, who took place for Dortmund’s Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga Legionaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in operation.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the 32nd minute with a 4-0 success.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) matched for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible lead striker.
It was in the 32nd minute.
Following an accidental defense by final man Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball over the line to 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer, SAP, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around $2 billion (around €1.5 billion) is expected to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,” Co-Chief Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The number of employees is expected to grow from around 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the more than 176,000 SAP customers worldwide are in the Boomland.

“Now we want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott said.
"Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Beauty and Horror: A Story of World War I, told in nineteen destinies" begins with a long list of main characters that goes to heart.
Here’s a tip on how to do: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's romantic narrative, and these main people will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when you, like Englund's, are lost in the mist of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he doesn’t misrepresent as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles, there are hardly any ambassadors, furious reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was," it's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unobtrusive men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die.
Each of these lives flickers like the votive candles in a church, some add, while others extinguish.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating positional war on the West Front.
"Beauty and Horror" hikes with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Bee baskets fall on the soldiers in this book, one celebrating Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsets flys are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smelling Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is home with her children and hears gunfires in the distance. Stay or take the flight?
Who's coming?
There is hardly anyone who understands what is happening or why this war is being waged.
"Lack of facts," notes Englund, "was furnished with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their stories of life can be terrifying or touching, but they are extremely alive in Englund’s accumulation of small moments lost in detail.
Many of them are dealing with lack and remediation.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake gum, paper joints, wooden buttons."
He talks more about the replacement meal in Germany.
He describes "meat made from squeezed rice and baked in sheep fat (and finally served with a fake wooden bone), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes that were lined with wood."
There were, he noted, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and says about the war: "You feel that, despite everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening paper or the best seller and a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, and pretending that such a façade meant civilization and that there was no barbarism behind your own strength."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will notice or take care of it.
“When you take a distance from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that happens in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as “a convicted man who was hanged in secret.”
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word, the mass murderers in a mass suit, who slaughter while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is as frivolous behaviour as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to get infected with a prostitute with a sexual illness in order to escape front service.
“The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with Gonocock pus, because soldiers bought and lubricated on their genitals in hopes of getting to the hospital,” he writes.
“Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, causing them to be blind for the rest of their lives.”
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes smooth and yet unobtrusive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed in a unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are bringing them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually fake like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques' "Nothing New in the West" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional fame hall.
His book has the most devastating end I have ever read in a book.
I can't do it anymore.
But it's as if he'd grabbed us with his book this page with the main persons in front of his nose and lit it with a plug.
After an early failure, a carefully planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wore operation helmets.
We had chosen the night of Monday to Tuesday because there were hardly any people in Zucotti Park at that time.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed, while all the others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police Chairman Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence stressed the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the decree and caused the homeowners to have an enormous increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to be repeated.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared this by watching how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a look at Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training – counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid displacement of a large number of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," someone familiar with the commands said, which was what a declaration called "exercise."
“The few police officers involved to my knowledge didn’t know it was about Zuccotti Park,” someone who wants to remain anonymous said.
“The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the resort.”
One reason for secrecy was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then retreated when hundreds of protesters gathered after they had learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including operational commandos from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials, who are usually employed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that over the course of the day many people go in and out of the park, almost like pendlers, so 1 o’clock at night is a good time to go in.
“It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people stay in the park,” he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and speakers were ready to depart on Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that sounded from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
As the public officials entered the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply collected their items and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give the protesters time to pack their possessions together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the surroundings to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, a spokesman for the police chief, said this was done for their own safety.
But many journalists say they wanted to stop them from watching the police operations in the park, and they said the dealings with the officers were very harsh.
Mr. Browne said television cars on Church Street could have taken pictures on the west side of the park.
As the police moved to the west by the great mess of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial grass and bags of clothes, their employees of the city cleaning, which lifted what had been left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to go, were dragged outside, and pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some built barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
Approximately 10 people in the epicenter of the camp joined together at their arms.
And two people tied themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
Police said the eviction was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, were due to “unsuitable behavior and resistance to an arrest.”
The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the criminal officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly did not "guide" the operation, as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials was waiting on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was observed from these locations that the police expanded the periphery around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officers, many of them with shields, were observed to push people out.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern vicinity.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and others left the air from the tires of a police bus.
At one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, a police officer and a protester came to the hospital.
The union of caregivers will file a lawsuit against the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school managers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday as the dismissals are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last possibility that the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other employees, who were among the lowest-paid employees in the city and lost their jobs on October 7, described the union leader as a political revenge for the city’s denied access to a health fund that the working groups had maintained with the households.
The allegations were categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing by the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the dismissals were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget specifies that school aid staff would be dismissed.
City Council officials 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference formally announced the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will bring Mr. Walcott and the City’s Ministry of Education as accused and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are coloured or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Ministry of Justice, said the city was not facing the suit and therefore could not comment on its individual claims.
According to a New York Times draft lawsuit, the union has focused on the number of dismissals at schools in the city’s poor neighborhoods to support a lawsuit for inequality of treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronicly underfunded.
She states that while there were no dismissals on Staten Island and few dismissals in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school workers in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 were dismissed in the 8th and 9th districts in the South Bronx.
Finding the loss of five out of eight school attendees who were employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood of parents who can organize donations to collect budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year and funds were lost as the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled through the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the storyline, even if "excess" usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's salary list to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been dismissed, not transferred," says the draft complaint.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
Ultimately, it seems that Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate’s Committee on International Relations adopted a resolution under the chairman John Kerry (Massachusetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have begun the reconstruction of their country,” Kerry said.
“It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties.”
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been simple in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House argued about the wording of a series of resolutions endorsing or disapproving the role of the US military in NATO’s Libyan mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution approving the restricted use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad marginal group of both parties and there was no vote.
On the same day, however, this law was passed in the Senate, and the Chamber overapproved a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission struck into a kind of legislative purgatory – with a Congress that was angry enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull the ground under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripoli fell among Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations “congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation” and “praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Panel on Foreign Relations or will they split the legislators, as did the June Act?
The latest version encounters the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every Congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area to be voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have tried enough often.
Goodlatte’s Amendment is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this Congress and covers a wide range of topics.
Some are double - the same law has been submitted to both Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget amendment in the Senate alone and another dozen that would “control federal spending.”
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners among Republicans who want to polish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have "written" such a measure.
The budget control law, which was passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a budget balance change.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limitation to two terms of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is, as is an amendment prohibiting the burning of flags, an ever-recurring template.
Some legislators also want to enable the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject it.
As eagerly as members propose changes, they are moving as fast as they have been in recent years.
At the 111st Congress, legislators introduced 77 such amendments.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Funded, but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from close distance during an election in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday evening, singing alone to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and saying that the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to Congress.
When she appeared on the ABC news "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, she ranked after words and needed help walking.
The program showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet, which split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back, caused.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her voice on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41), replied, "All right."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" special recorded shortly before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special tracks Gifford's recovery since the attack on January 8.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see her in the hospital bed, with a barbed head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to make simple movements.
A nick with the head.
A crack with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: you can see the Congressman singing together with the therapists for Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'."
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he had read Giffords an article in a daily newspaper about the assassination on March 12, when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a Missouri prison and is forced to receive medical treatment while waiting for his trial.
“Many people have died,” said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer told, she said, "I was hit."
“So, I would say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t defeated?’” Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you'll get through this and you'll recover and you'll come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smoking stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, observed among other things by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers meant it well.
I know that.
But it was no respect, really not. It was pity.
The sharp contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring, American public.
The troops are crowded with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, servicemen say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if they were suffering in uniform.
“We were by no means victims,” said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way to support is to push us into the role of unfortunate souls.”
The topic is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They have also realized that the anger that the returning troops struck in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, talks about compassion take place in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of reverence, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an angry, violent veteran is hiding under the surface, Cancians said, who had fought in Iraq and took up a state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interrogators subtly asked whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington immediately after his return from the struggle.
"When you talk about your service, you have to hold the negative impressions against it," Cancian told his sons.
The lack of military ease is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely taken out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely usual during World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to harshly intervene in rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape in the military court.
If it does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped at night by a soldier colleague.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12-pack beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her for a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texanic wiped away her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my stomach feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman’s room, the man stood behind them, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they filed against former Defense Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld will be allowed for court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not acted against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months they increased to 28: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, condemn or adequately condemn the case.
Burke says she pursues the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchically built,” she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of them may be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs laying their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Team for the Ministry of Defense, led by Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed an application to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court records of Newsweek detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged with injury by current or previous soldiers in the armed forces.
Based on a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries involving active soldiers.
"The alleged damages occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document states.
The Ministry of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to service in battle, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with native women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat actions.
It is time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she does not stand alone in her struggle: three other complaints besides them are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans’ Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting an anti-female atmosphere.
Independently of this, the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America is gathering a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the "personal disorder" diagnosis of rape victims in order to release them from service - a common practice, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing her of discriminatory practices in dealing with benefit claims for persons claiming to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented to Congress independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, offering a number of clues.
According to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, 3,158 sexual abuse was reported in 2010.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases occurring annually.
The report, which was published in March, also investigates the rates of law enforcement: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases recorded in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the alleged military police rape less than an hour after the raid.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell a whole series of police officers, doctors and commanders the details of her rape.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, who asked her about the sex she had before she assaulted her boyfriend.
Six people expressed themselves as witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately exonerated.
“I still remember the day the judgment was read,” says Lyman.
"I thought the labor would start, I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out I told my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure, that was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed dishonestly, so she did not receive any support.
Whether the lawsuit Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "In my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is behind a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence that liability entails.
He adds, “The chances are against them... but it’s important for them that they try.”
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow her path, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms come,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many boys who sent his anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to committing an attack in Norway in July in which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is by far not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time until his attack in front of his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists supporting far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found that it was not difficult to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the UK’s DEMOS idea factory on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the site to exactly define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy – just as marketers have done for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the adds invited users to a survey that asked about their level of education, their attitude toward violence, and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to question more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without even once having to leave their office.
“It’s a pretty new research method,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and are annoyed by immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends such as "likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three contents per day, Facebook’s data supernova generates a research boom that has increased the number of research papers with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this page you can study people you normally don’t reach with your clipboard on the street.
“If you tried to question people of the British National Party before, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“They had to inform the party first and it would never have granted them access,” Bartlett says.
“At Facebook, it’s all gone – you’re going straight to them.”
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal-level students, such as residential consultants, monitor the site and help a student post too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem if you haven’t recognized it,” Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle told the Washington Post.
“We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise.”
Facebook is also constantly capturing the data of its own population.
The site’s data team has created statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, election participation in the 2010 mid-elections, and a national happiness index (which primarily used information that only Facebook has access - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data foundation available to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to share your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles at all,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn says.
So, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research has to take care of the social – and a lot of social life is still taking place offline.”
"Cool and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who stood in two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and a Templar Knight of Norway,” he said in a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I appeal to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge the laws, but I am not guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "would not give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the Breivik police to remain in custody for another 12 weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks, saying that the authorities will closely monitor all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in hopes of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he remained behind lock and locks.
They all participated with the goal that everything would go out of one way.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," a survivor from Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it's going a bit further after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and looked calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre hint that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may please some that the attacks of July 22 appeared to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," the relative of a victim said.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 Lessons from the Interview with the Deceased Steve Jobs Shown This Week in a Theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans may find most insightful in the recently discovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings in the major markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and even appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who was eager to make charts - a man who believed that many executives suffer from "a disease of thought," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great idea."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Specialist Fools" about the break-up of the personal computer, and he sat together with jobs for more than an hour, holding one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, it had been more than 10 years since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the widespread acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiots, he says the copy templates of the interview were missing at delivery.
Only after Job’s death was a complete VHS copy discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will be released on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known for hating detailed interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer breaks between question and answer – 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which jobs clearly weigh their thoughts and strive for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seemingly impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and urges him to respond faster to topics or side actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone recorded, the Lost Interview appears somehow terribly far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right or wrong in his opinion and represents his own vision of the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous career worthiness jobs', but seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer on the leap to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a company:
"For all the years in the business, I always ask, 'Why are you doing things?' And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in the business really thinks about things in depth.
That's what I've found out.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed by how costs were recorded - most of the time they started with "standard costs", which were calculated on the basis of mere assumption and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the very least.
How the Pope was declared:
Jobs tells about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to get into the phone company and make long distance calls for free.
A lot has been written about the device, but Job’s enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while sliding through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you buzzed into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door,” Jobs says kickering.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think it would be without Apple.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious joke that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called in the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the pope while they could as well succumb to Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phonebook and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for her.
How to improve innovations:
Several times in the interview Jobs talks about how to invent new products spontaneously.
Early in his career, when he installed some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think about both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he remembers the problems he had when developing a computer mouse:
“I remember the pervasive arguments... they screamed to me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are slowing down:
Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs predicted the ways so many industrial giants trapped with their visions and lost control over their shares.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're making a better copy or printer, and then?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [are such people] that ultimately lead the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is needed by people who do not have a concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship.
This happened with Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
One could have been ten times bigger if Microsoft had been in the 1990s.
They caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
“There’s a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it goes out to the taste, it goes out to try to deal with the best things that people have created, and then try to bring those things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were by chance the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn’t been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health laws, as court takes case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically-sharing question of whether to hear an appeal to President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm to represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges gathered for a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be addressed was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching healthcare reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became a keyword among conservative activists across the United States.
In fact, a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to boost the 2012 presidential struggle, which will be fully underway at the time the court decision is announced.
The attorney who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be overturned will probably be Paul Clement, formerly a prosecutor general under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-fashioned group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenges the law.
Another sponsor was pharmacist Pfizer Inc., who is enormously financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case at a Washington hotel.
Among other things, the service was Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican group in the Senate and a declared opponent of health reform.
The guests of the dinner, Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
Indeed, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in benefit events by law of nearby and other organizations, whereas the judge may not be a spokesman, honorary guest or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was sufficient to alert moral and government activists.
“This astonishing breach of morality and the opposition to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges lies, the court follows the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dined during a beneficial event with lawyers with floating court proceedings."
Their appearance and support for a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they would mix court matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it was judge Elena Kagan who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a prosecutor general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to trial in first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case for prejudice, as she was too committed to defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan does not make any institutions to do this.
Boeing draws record order of $18 trillion to land
The airline Emirate has ordered 50 two-way Boeing 777 aircraft with an option on 20 other aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really a rare news that a company gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is at a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is the client of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order ever for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline has also announced it at the Dubai Aviation Show in 2011, an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves passenger fuel consumption and comfort.
The list price for six of these planes is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s stock market manager.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they do not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but rather a rise in oil prices, which is usually harmful to airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, not as harmful as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders as oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural protection,” he said.
Emirates’ appointment reiterates Boeing’s leadership position in the large-scale aircraft market and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS in check, which attacks the A350’s dominance.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the launch of the largest A350 that competes directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more trust after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President seems to lose election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer's opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI supported in the race for the post of governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application for the post of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the post of governors in the Western state.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country,” Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
“They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... they occupied electoral cabins, built road blocks ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI].”
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo seems to have beaten Claderon, who had been running in the polls before the day of the election.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother’s conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently in office governor, came in third place, a serious defeat for the split and unhappy left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia's capital, denies ties to drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates left the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan seem.
The man who will probably be representing the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington, saying, "I think this victory will let us look courageously into next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downtrend that will slow Asia’s economy growth.
Manila-based ADB Administrative Director Rajat Nag said the two fastest-growing economies in the world must do “everything in their power” to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that are “unsatisfactory” looking at the difficulties in Europe, saying that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
“So everyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is not immune.”
“If China and India can help, then with every means.”
The European Monetary Union has encountered a serious debt crisis in recent months.
Italy’s interest rates have risen dangerously in recent days and the Prime Ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe raises fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to calls for the leading emerging markets to come together to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of EU Rescue Fund bonds, the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) – offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and drying out foreign capital flows.
“No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s a task, because where else we can find work for our millions of young men and women.”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no motivation to help the wealthy Europeans when they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically very difficult to sell the 1.2 trillion people in India aid for Europe, of whom more than 800 million live at $2 or even less a day.
"Sometime they will find out that the Greeks are going to retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, asked similarly why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, losing facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
ADB's forecast of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011 / now threatens "the risk of grading" due to the threat of threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves against a downtrend and a significant capital outflow of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defence Minister Leon Panetta warmed Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnoticedly weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the scenes of war in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly bands.
The Pentagon is already thinking about cuts of $450 trillion over the coming decade, but is now concerned that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress fails to complete spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a stop to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such unexpected ways, would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntaryly separate ourselves from most of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a probability that is certainly limited to the probability to be able to reach the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faiths of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness.”
The cuts were ultimately hitting the fighting troops,” Panetta said.
"While the wartime quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings have been shortened, leading to delays in settings and hiring oversight that support the war."
“The salaries of the staff would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime dealers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago asking for more details about the potential influence of the automatic cuts on the Defense Ministry.
“The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are vehemently against this draconian act,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
“This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly none that should be imposed on us.”
“The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and should not be allowed to enter.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and Senators’ new warnings will increase pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remain to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly unblinked the possible cuts, although he was able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the head of the Pentagon, knowing that he is facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painted a dark picture of what could be coming - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squad without sufficiently trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission,” Panetta said in his opening address to the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that lacks morality and alertness and is unable to take it up with potential opponents.”
“She really makes you angry.”
In an attachment to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disasters, serious restrictions on our global ability to deploy and engage, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship, and the new groundfighting vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
If further development and testing of the F35 were stopped, this would save up to $80 trillion in the next 10 years, but advocates say it is an important next step to upgrade so that possible dangers can be baned by China and other opponents.
How to uncover a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy managing the accusations of sexual harassment by several women, both sides accusing each other of lying.
The head of Penn State is accused of false oath for allegedly retaining reports of a retired football coach sexually abusing boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself a fool as he circulated denials that were very quickly refuted by unchanging evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of breaches in campaign funding related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it will forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about scrubbing in school and at college exams are widespread.
There were incidents where teachers gave their students the exam responses so that they were well at their performance checks themselves.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and screams are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times each day.
Many of these lies are considered a necessity.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or “discovering lies” is one that is important to learn for every person, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a societal game such as Sharaden, where the goal is to call “Have You!”, the uncovering of a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data gathered over the past six decades from prestigious universities conducting far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths about lying have been uncovered.
Lies look in one’s eyes.
They do not always stab, stab, red, and chill.
However, it must not be concluded from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and uncover.
A trained liar can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, which is fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years examining the scientific outcomes of the comprehensive and steadily growing field of deception, and it is clear that exposing a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us find right in our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning individuals or negotiating or managing belongs to our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more often lying than introverted people that men are more often lying "self-oriented" than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often lying to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly fat).
We also know that when a person is exposed as a wrongdoer, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It provides a reference point for subsequent evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, laughter, voice quality of your experimenter.
You should better know when someone normally tripping with the foot constantly, so they do not wrongly accuse him if he tripping with the foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that crisp, not as evidence of dissimulation.
People who deceive may stir when trying to remember their story. Maybe their feet point toward the door or they lean toward the output, significantly change their position or show a "relaxation after the recruitment conversation", that deep, relaxing breathing and changing attitude when all the tough questions are over.
Questioners often mistakenly signal that a recruitment conversation is over only to look after that relaxation after the recruitment conversation.
Also, pay attention to the language of your experimenter.
Scott Peterson's slider is famous when he used the form of the past when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question overall.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to my best knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceived than factual, which often causes the alarm bells to ring.
There is no magic to uncover lies, but you can learn skills that make it possible to uncover lies.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can rarely become the victim of fraudsters, both in their private and professional life.
Controversial oil pipeline plan revised after threat due to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, annoying trade unions while calming environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that one can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will ultimately be approved, although with a different track record.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week that one would delay a decision on a federal approval for the project until the new possible course was reviewed, avoiding the Sandhills area in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Foreign Ministry may delay a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Foreign Ministry and agreed to his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska’s legislators, who are against the plan, are weighing the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills and Ogallala Aquifer region, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ impact on the environment has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the principal auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review procedure focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly forced a toddler out of fear to vomit
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle had had a crackdown in the lobby of her Manhattan building that would have made her little daughter so afraid that she surrendered to fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade made the 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "personal changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with luggage and Genevieve on her arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and left her daughter for a moment.
"Someone came behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
I told her, "I don't care what you're saying or thinking."
She became angry and started to reproach—she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to tilt water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” the mother of the child said.
LaBelle struck on the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her accompaniment and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls requesting a comment.
The lawsuit is for an unspecified damages compensation, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he did not charge a fee and plans the family to donate the money they get to help children with cancer.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is revealed to a kindergartener carrying an 18-month-old baby on her arm.”
Climate challenges slow down the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez in the government, unemployment and black labour rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 is remembered in Sinaloa’s economic history. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change and boosting great hopes for economic growth, is at the government. However, due to climatic difficulties, growth can not be talked about, but rather deteriorated the main economic indicators.
The low temperatures in February not only caused million-high losses in agriculture, but also put tight boundaries on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historic decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which had a slow impact on other economic sectors.
According to a report issued by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexico’s Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land used were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a continuous increase in unemployment in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, since from January to March 55 053 Sinaloa inhabitants had no employment in the first quarter, equivalent to 4.53 percent of the labour force.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment rate in Sinaloa this year is due to several factors. Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autonoma (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly declare the rise in unemployment.
“What we’re currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses in the market as a result of the money cuts passed by legislation to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who illegally accumulate dollars, it’s not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them or use them for anything else,” he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment also has a demographic factor inherent.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and on the other because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here looking for work, which causes unemployment to rise," he says.
Black labour
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high proportion of black labour, which according to INEGI covers 60.38 percent of the employees in the country who work without depositing in the social security funds.
Unemployment and black labour include low wages, the lowest in all of Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexico Social Security Institute) and the Secretaria del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Mexico’s Government of Labour and Social Care).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September, much less than the total government average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and rising unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years was recorded in 2011. According to the Secretariat de Economia, the ADI was $630,597 from January to June, equivalent to a loss of 87.74 percent compared to the $5,143,312 in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaria de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, primarily from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In the face of the economic crisis in July, the state government applied for a loan of 3,000,000,000,000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The state congress approved an amount of 200,000,000 pesos, but no positive impact of debt on any of the country's industries was found by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of Mario López Valdé’s rule became apparent.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry in Mexico) said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year, it is necessary to work hard to recover the land lost this year and in 2012 we have to double our efforts. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year complicated and slowed the country's economic development.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important effects is a slowed economy that is not in motion enough to generate an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will complete the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefine vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Entrepreneurship Association) in Sinaloa, declared that it was necessary to encourage the state to take more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done, and we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to re-determine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that drives the government’s efforts on better track.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, and what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possessing eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Republic’s prosecutor’s office announced that the small drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health – here the possession of marijuana intended for trade.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military personnel during the surveillance of Cipriano Valdez street in front of guard post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The small drug dealer drove in a white van, in which he held a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack, in which the military found eight pounds and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the seized goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punishment remains in the enforcement office.
Debt for construction works
The social buildings for migrants provided for in Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programs are at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the Urban Social Development Authority stated that although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds available to it that exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said that the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federation and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction works, which is why a delay in the completion of construction is expected.
"Twelve million of them have to contribute, and even though the year is already at the end, they have not given us a penny, and that, even though they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started the construction works, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state had failed to fulfil its obligations, which is why the municipality had to receive a loan of 7 million at the beginning of his rule, which corresponds to the amount that the central government should have paid.
"This had already happened to us during the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the resources that the state had not spent on to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the government authorities were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance had requested to accelerate the administrative work and pay the outstanding share as quickly as possible.
“Nearly 12 million people have to contribute, and even though the year is about to end, they haven’t given us a penny.”
Court approves transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transition of analog to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which has to be advanced from analog to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the decree of law detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute launched by the Senate because it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes for the court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the draft lawsuit, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the Decree of Law unconstitutional, as the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) (Federal Telecommunications Commission in Mexico) would be responsible for the regulations concerning radio and television.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the decree of law. After accepting the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the decree of law and stopped all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council also rejected the appeal lodged by the House of Representatives, without intervening in the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he disagreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the government of the country may not regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration with general rules.
"I don't think that if you did that would impair the independence of the regulatory body," she also reminded that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it leads national affairs.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that has occurred in recent years around the world, and it results in better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, she said, is a postponement of the benefit of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest that has not only technical aspects, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "made the action of the entire system necessary, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a set of features that the Constitution put into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital transformation, through the government, despite having highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that by issuing the contested decree, the government would interfere with the competences of Congress, because the legislation passed would be complied with.”
The possibility of counting votes in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP figures, the difference between the first and second places in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual counting of votes is a reality in the Michoacán elections this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the governor elections is just about 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that only last November 9th, the electoral office had adopted a series of regulations to harmonize local regulations with state reforms in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that neither Michoacán’s political constitution, nor his electoral law, nor his electoral justice law had adapted to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they did not enter into force at this round of elections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional suit filed by the local legislature and judged the representative’s voice on the constitutional reforms as “invalid and unlawful” as he has no right to “decide or veto it.”
María de los Ángeles Llanderal stated in an interview on the possibility of individual counting of votes that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, the local electoral authority could now count the votes in part or in full.
For example, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be counted in part under the following conditions. The results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol on the counting and calculation of votes is not present or is not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
Furthermore, the overall counting of fully completed votes may be made if there is a difference between the alleged winner and the second-placed winner that is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman before who is the second of the said candidates.
The total counting of votes may also be made if, after the ordinary calculation has been completed, it is determined that the difference between the alleged winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second places is almost 0.16%, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinámé mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés roamed down on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening.
According to family members, the last will of the Lieutenant Colonel was that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honour, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others killed in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a Mexican Air Force plane.
At noon, the Lieutenant Colonel’s ashes landed in the mourning hall on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family members and friends went.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Technological Institute of Saltillo, which was initiated by his former fellow students from the technical high school and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio was attending during his preparation for the high school.
“He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be spread over the Zapalinamé mountains, as he always told his family and friends,” said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot’s sister.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she is of the opinion that he was in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptionally as a father and son, a loving brother and he always stood for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the Zapopán Air Force School, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it because they thought it would even be dizzying on a truck, but he always sought to make his dream of becoming a pilot come true.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio recalls him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family already wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he went to Zapopán to graduate from his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying an airplane.
A Last Farewell
Felipe Bacio Cortés, Lieutenant-Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, was appointed with all honour by Governor Jorge Torres López. His honour was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the Sixth Military Territory, the Mexican Air Force, head of school and student of the technological education institution of Saltillo.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which State Secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six others from the same authority sat, crashed.
At 18:05 the incensed remains of Bacio Cortés, citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force at the front of the barracks by the funeral company, headed by Major Jaime Martinez.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot on the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military members introduced the media to eleven people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of the body and a shot of mercy in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event took place at the 1.5 mile point of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several transients saw the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, locked up wide.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One was wearing a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; next to him was another, dressed in a white top.
About a meter away was another person’s body in red t-shirt and blue trousers.
All three were on their belly.
According to local information, the three persons must have been murdered elsewhere because no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house there are engravings that one organized criminal gang writes to another, and several shots have been found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) introduced 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal gang mainly in the town of Cadereyta, associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo and secret funerals.
According to the public information, eight people were initially arrested in the Los Alveros settlement on November 11 and one prisoner was released.
Three properties and a cell phone were seized, and the detainees confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6 a.m., military personnel found a car with no number plates and two occupants on their round of guard in the town of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the car inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13 at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who, when the military sighted, tried to escape.
They will be charged with secret funerals in the villages of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Formation of the new Italian government on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government, which is to offer the forehead of the crisis that led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government, which is to offer the forehead of the crisis that led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of government.
It is assumed that he will introduce a cabinet composed of a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take office.
Monti said he would introduce the president to the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of government.
"I want to reiterate my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “frame is now well set up,” he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, much less time than normal, while Italy is struggling with a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a harsh savings package called for by Euro politicians to regain the shattered trust in Italy.
The pressure to rush on Monti was further reinforced by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were charged with 7 percent interest rates for 10 years, which corresponds to the state at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue parachute.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confindustria Industrial Association, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government as we could."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Montis chances of success were significantly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are meant to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have opposed a majority technocratic government that Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or the delay of reforms could once again cause a devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure with its hint that Monti’s failure is a disaster.
Monti began debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women’s organizations.
Tuesday evening the round of meetings will be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who initiated an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief breathing at the end of last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian government bonds have returned to critical limits due to uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
A rescue of Italy with a debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue parachute.
Monti said his government should last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should consist only of technicians, a hint to their concerns in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
Spaniards have more game opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players obtained from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the spot.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 summoned 50 games has left behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when comparing the 22 players from both countries for the friendly match, which will take place today at 15.05 a.m. at San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champion, number one on the FIFA monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-coloured team only has defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players playing in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home matches (league and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated excretion games at the Eurocup and the world football championships.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters within the framework of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking.
We will see the Spanish team draw their last record: Goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who scored against England on Saturday (loss 0-1 in London) with 126 overseas matches with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will have a new record of 127 overseas matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition from UEFA last week, along with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle-striker of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number Hundert is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso at 91, Fernando Torres at 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both at 81, Andrés Iniesta at 62, Cesc Fábregas at 61 and David Silva at 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side striker Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas at 31, Randall Azofeifa at 32, Michael Barrantes at 31, Carlos Hernández at 36 and José Luis López at 35.
The one with the fewest games.
Less than 30 matches in the Spanish team include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
Roy Miller at 26, Winston Parks at 26, Gabriel Badilla at 25 and Roy Myrie at 23.
The rest isn’t even approaching the 20s boundary.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, Víctor Bolívar has only recorded one in Costa Rica and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson haven’t had their debut yet.
The historical goalkeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres at 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored nine more goals, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its twentieth anniversary
“Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true.
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream will come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by the group’s bassist and co-founder, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is located in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twentieth anniversary and on Sunday, 20, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m., together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that comes true for us too.
This is just the second time we’ve been playing in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I have only been on vacation in Costa Rica once. It is such a beautiful country that we will surely stay there for a few more days.
It is exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are totally devoted. They are experiencing the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for all these years by our side.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people even think your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Isn’t that putting some pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve done over the past 21 years took place over the last two weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we love to surf and we are enthusiastic about the jungle, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are for surfing. In this way, we learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour you have offered giant shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we do not set ourselves any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and provide our fans with a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
- Why? - Yeah.
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes a different song, so the decision we’re going to play isn’t easy.
If we record two or three songs that we haven’t played for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they might be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe that is why, also for the audience.
With this tour you will celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, total.
First of all, I believe that no one of us imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years. It looks like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and it is great to be able to make music together even now.
We like ourselves and are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Sometimes a band comes out of a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw soundgardens on their tour. We are delighted to still be friends with them all and it honors us to be part of this arising Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago, which alone is much longer than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate ourselves lucky to be still alive and also we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
They trust each other and their music, and we couldn't be better off.
Your relationship to fame hasn’t always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you have always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often because it’s too easy to fall into this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it created, without being obsessed with being a famous rock star, which never interested us anyway.
What do you remember about your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed that it took us so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to talk together and to others about music and football.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that’s why you chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band the most, so we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This will surely be exciting.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter whenever you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to him.
Who was influenced by you as a bassist?
From so many+
The first ones I think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive even though it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I don’t think we all feel very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, I can remember the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who came up at the same time. Although they are still important today, I think it’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now she’s more positive.
- Why? - Yeah.
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem somewhat lightweight, but there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
The tears came to me when I heard Ed playing them, and they were very dark songs.
I think as you get older and something traumatic happens in your life — for example, when you lose a family member or friend — that affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who spent 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his rule (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, who is operated and under control four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal physician, told television that Fujimori would be investigated for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that he believes Fujimori could be forgiven for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want it because he considered him innocent.
He has been operated four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight, including other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor counted.
Fujimori has been in the detention centre Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la Policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruvian army, which was secretly active during his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch its visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday, according to the Uruguayan President, which will be the culmination of his full schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón’s support for the incident with France when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still act as tax paradises, which was rejected by Uruguay and led to a question from his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chaired by the G20 since November, a group of the world’s most powerful emerging and developed countries. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid duplication with the South American country.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has been trying to accelerate the concretization of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be deleted from the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
On a business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The cordless installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly to rescue Princess Peach from the evil Bowser for 25 years, but never in three dimensions so far: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the store counters around the world this month, has been tailored from the very beginning to the features of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played without a special three-dimensional glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to tell how stereoscopy works without glasses,” said Omar Álvarez, who was responsible for the Spanish press specializing in Nintendo at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" was Nintendo's "first video game developed for this console from the beginning", as hit articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were customizations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman stressed that although it is three-dimensional, Super Mario 3D Land is an "affordable" video game that allows for a fast, smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to capture the less snug users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of the games, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action in real time, but to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects" you must always play three-dimensional.
This trip of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo flickers to the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the latest editions: The cordless installer must overcome dangerous platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about movements, the environment, disguise and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom Guarantees for Delivery of Portillos to the United States
Guatemalan President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he would accept the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to be responsible in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus, the trial ends on the US request for the extradition of Portillo so that he can be brought to court there.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on independence from the judiciary and government, considering that a decision-making court had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his rule he had not interfered in court decisions and had accepted any extradition requests he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín are being handed over for murder and serious injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
The action of Colom is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be handed over if his legal situation is clarified in Guatemale and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of the defeat of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his rule, before the extradition, but the minister opposed and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organization was launched to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organization Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter century, 6,000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over 100 jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, yesterday a balance sheet was drawn at an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people participated.
Trinijove was launched in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, unemployed, with drug problems at risk of marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu took part in numerous leaders of institutions and institutions that have worked with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions during the campaign demonstrated the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former Socialist Minister of Education Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green councillor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also attended by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated, but he added that the work done so far is "a good foundation".
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a model that knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in trouble.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work it does,” he said.
Occupied house where giant party was held was cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve residents left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of house No. 51 on the street of Balmes have ended.
Twelve people volunteered yesterday at noon to leave the building that they had illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The eviction was carried out on court order without any police intervention.
After clearance, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the house manager confirmed.
The homeowners, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took with them the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, painted the walls and left all kinds of garbage, especially cans with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were held, which lasted up to two days, and the tenants were forced to despair.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, said her business had declined by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the nightclub pointed out that the housekeepers made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks for three euros, while those at the nightclub cost 10 euros.
Furthermore, the owner of the recreational premises had been reported by the neighbors for rest disruption, while according to her statement the noise did not originate from the visitors to the disco, but from the homeowners and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which according to the statements of the angry neighbors in recent weeks became more and more longer.
The directors of the nightclub stated that the harassment was so great that it agreed with the owner of the building that he would not have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from its neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular) in the city council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, called for the building to be cleared immediately and to tackle the problems of bourgeois coexistence and the downfall of the neighborhood last week.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that in the last few months, the occupiers had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments.
In that sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to act against the antisocial acts in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3.30 p.m., police approached Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed four people trying to invade the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes about the fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The urban call for the 16 goals opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the peak of the now disappearing Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its contempt for the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in figures to the Central Park of New York.
With the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park became in the eyes of many again the upper limit of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread north-south, but up (mountain) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
Now, it was not Central Park but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the yogi bear.
So far it was when the city issued a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola in September.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone is planning to put gates to the countryside.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The invitation is not only from an organizational point of view, but also with a view to reflecting on the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It’s almost a recurring topic that two members of this old-seated caste who meet in the elevator can resort to.
And precisely this fact provides the substance for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary to speak about the "front on the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which was given over the green apples, has not been held.
“It should be based on the principle that Barcelona’s largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" holds a "lexical trap": it is not to be imagined "as access to a park, but as a borderline of areas where it has to be acted."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona, with urban design experience, views the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space entails today" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan singing" in the field of the forum.
The first concern is its own limitation to what can be built.
"To narrow something always means to set the next step," i.e. to cross it.
“We have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster.”
Modol, who is closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona", and that for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola that should not "encounter deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it gave its committee the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
Furthermore, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of conduct letter allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" about whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams launched ("exactly the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, since the terms of tender lack a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the axis Mountain-Sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that considers the area as a whole."
At least in his case, this led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is so equipped in its entire length directly above the Ronda de Dalt that a soft transition between the city and the green zones is created.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of Casino Red released the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the trial against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after Casino Red’s representative forgives him before the District’s Second Criminal Court, which tries the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for blackmail.
Following the attack on Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, released a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approves the secret operation of the betting house.
Following the criminal complaint, the prosecutor’s office opened a criminal proceeding against the brother of the panic mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Antiguo district of the capital.
He remained there 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the Ministerial Officer rejected the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta detention facility for allegedly bribeing the owners of the Casino Red with a million and a half pesos, but remained only a few hours in the medium-security facility because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as a prisoner of the San Nicolás de los Garza city prison.
On October 25, he was given a detention order by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, which found that after the nearly two-month investigations, there was sufficient evidence to convict Jonas of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house to open it in return.
On Monday, Casino Red’s representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to pass the sentence, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, García Gómez, asked whether the court had corrected the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had pronounced his forgiveness, but the lawyer retained the name.
Under Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is freely voiced and no objections can be filed against the proceedings, as well as no damages are required.
Following the hearing of the representative of the betting house at 3.50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been released and his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announced details of the plane accident in which Secretary of Government Francisco Blake and seven others were killed.
The Secretariat de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat of Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation of the accident in which Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven others were killed indicates that the helicopter with its entire unscathed structure has hit the ground directly without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communication and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wings had contact with trees at 25 meters high, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it fulfilled all the requirements for the transport of the personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations into the area where the machine was crashed.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the surcharge affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it fulfilled all requirements for passenger transportation.
The area has a bend of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter was flying from the Estado Mayor Presidential on the flight speed and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual Flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the visual flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded adequate weather conditions at departure, and some deep-hanging clouds emerged during the flight to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the helicopter's final radar recording match. There may not be any loss of control over the aircraft or any deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to now suggests that the helicopter was impacted from straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggest that the helicopter had hit the ground with its intact structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft at the accident site do not suggest fire or explosion.
The latest results indicate several ground contacts.
On-site investigations found aircraft parts at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level. The site is depleted and has a bend of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area that went beyond the locked area at the accident site, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had collided against the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
She is leading a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is conducting a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents entitled "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence" to find the genetic markers in connection with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Division of Medical Research, focus biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Prospectives can come to the sports courts of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and youth are carried out every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports court of Cuauhtémoc (west of the state of Mexico) and continued since October 8 on the sports court of Nezahualcóyolt (east of the state of Mexico).
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will continue on the sports court of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and complete on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics associated with the development of obesity and to identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Diabetes Day, he said it is intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should complete nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and family history of the disease to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further explained that on the said Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, height, waist circumference), their blood pressure and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with childhood obesity) were monitored.
Cruz López emphasized that this investigation would be conducted on the occasion of the concern of the health workers about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in nearly six years the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 per cent and the proportion of girls with obesity increased by 47 per cent.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He said that one Mexican (in) on average is 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity is expressed in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) taken to us so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the subjects would be in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and the inner arm (akanthosis), indicating the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information will be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all measurement results and suggest lifestyle changes appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there were three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of walking short walks.
The high calorie intake, i.e., an increased consumption of sugary beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from UNAM prevents crashing holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM developed polymer-modified asphalt to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If attention was paid to the signs coming from the road flooring, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 bumper holes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico) broke out, Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, warning and assuring that if the bumper was brokened,
In his lecture "Blagholes from a technical point of view", which he held on the occasion of the International Year on Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but that has a greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of road flooring and thus avoid the appearance of bumper holes.
He explained that asphalt - the heaviest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphene - and the other part a low - the so-called malthene. Together they give the road flooring its characteristic tough elastic behavior.
Tensilelast behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of nearly 180° C., it is very tense at 120° C. and almost firm at 50° C., while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
“This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations,” said the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that Mexico City’s streets have a majority of flexible road flooring composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers there is a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer has been bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows a good force distribution in the road flooring.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be distributed even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the wear layer," he explained, "is laid a final layer, the so-called carrier layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and they have to produce friction.
In addition, the support layer requires an appropriate thickness and the material from which it is composed must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water," he said, "because it significantly impairs the behavior of the wear layer.
When the site becomes moist, water penetrates into the layer and is difficult to return, causing a softening of all layers of road flooring and, as a result, the appearance of bumper holes.
"If a hole arises," he said, "the cover layer will first be removed, while the wear layer will only be affected afterwards, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by adequate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican National Research System) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of bumper holes and that the thickness of each layer of road flooring must always be proportional to the vehicle load and ensure that this regulation is complied with to avoid frequent bumper holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example about asphalt emulsions that are already on the market in other countries, and with which the drums could be repaired easily and without the application of high temperatures.
What lacked the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors affecting Melina Ramírez Serna’s failure to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives its 14th mistitle.
Again, Valle del Cauca went out empty when awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winning podium, showcasing a silver crown and the band she is showcasing as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena (2008), where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 mistitles (19 Catjura and Melina Lorerez (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1989) and Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1990), Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1990), Al Cons (1990), Al Cons (1990) and Al Cons (1990) (1990) and Al Cons (1990), Al Cons (1990), Al Cons (1990) (1990), Al Cons (1990) (19) and Al Cons (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) and Al Cons (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) and Al Cons (19) Al Cons (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) Al Cons Al Cons (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) Al Cons (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) Al Cons Al Cons Al Cons Al Cons () (19) (19) and and () (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) and and and and () (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) and and () (19) (19) (19) (19) and and and and () (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) and and and () (19) (19) (19) (19) and () (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) () (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) and () (19) and () () () () () and () () () () () () () () () () () () () ())) and))))))) () () () () () () () () () () and () ()
The big question that many people ask today is: What was missing?
The result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every show that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. She had been elected the queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles also received by the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia with their homes.
The first factor that is considered to be decisive in the decision of the jury to appoint her as the First Miss is that she did not convince the answer to the question "Which book influenced you most and why?", which was asked to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it’s a way of civilizing myself, ultimately I believe that the book that shaped my childhood’s most, ‘The Little Prince’, is a rather deep book.
Currently I'm reading `Gult and Atonement'. It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book that means `Passions'.
A response that encountered little counter-love, firstly because of the term 'civilize herself', and secondly because it had not explained in concrete terms how any book that she named had influenced her.
But at the end of the ceremony, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the outcome: "The universe is wise, it is happening what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little `The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle has been burned out.
A journalist from Bogotá suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one who gave all the applause and had received all the awards in advance (gastronomy competition Oster, audience vote on the best hand-made costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which the queen therefore stressed on the scene.
And this was noted at their first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at their two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she was sure of both, she lacked the power and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist for the "Como en casa" program at RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition doesn't eventually become queen."
Moreover, Valle went out of the way to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
It will already have its reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
“Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had worked on projects before participating in the competition,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned with her defects in the hind and fibrosis noted in the stomach area, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good dietary habits, and responsible physical work.
The Queens’ coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there would be better, “but her problem with fibrosis on the stomach, which was hardly noticeable to me honestly, drove her score the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believed that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgical procedures she had undergone.
“The operations are okay, but Valle didn’t know how to get them done right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place she had to pay."
Due to this award, awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction was made after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was smiled that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation award to prevent her from enjoying the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina begins her rule year, not as a queen but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will enter history as one of the queens who had missed the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscope from Cali entered the story as the man who identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a lophoscope from the investigative unit of the Prosecutor’s Office (CTI) of Cali entered as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): “Alfonso Cano” by comparing the fingerprints.
Among the seven lophoscopists in the department of the CTI, this week Eliazar González had been the readiness service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal proceedings for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he frequently had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completion of the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
In the week of defeat against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one could be that of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he should take the ten-finger printed sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was located with the investigator, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not at all similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, did not wear glasses and was much thinner.
Fingerprints are not lying.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the print sheet.
He had seen it correctly: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was actually the head of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a dactyloscope from the Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the deployment against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a criminal offence.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery matters and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders either present false identity documents or do not have any.
We'll take their fingerprints and find them in the database.
The researcher told us that in the event of a theft he had to tear a piece of a wall out of a house, because the thief had supported himself with his hand at this very point when he took out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for taking fingerprints, but in this case we were able to take the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by bottles of alcohol.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspected, and actually a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee the murderer, he is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A dactyloscopist at the CTI stated that "fingerprints with chemical or physical reactants would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a seedling shell or tape is used to take.
Afterwards, the prints are sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the personal register.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without identification papers," said the CTI expert.
He said that not everything was as it would be shown in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all that shines is gold, not all that you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The “indignation” challenges the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Much of them complied with the eviction warrant and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday as they tried again to enter Manhatten Square with a court order after being cleared from the square at dawn and trying to occupy another seat on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access a court order that allowed the "indigned" to re-tent at this site. Meanwhile, another part of the movement kept on the eviction warrant and occupied a park further north of the city where nine arrests occurred.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp in the square, we will meet elsewhere and continue the battle with legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, one of the Occupy Wall Street spokespersons.
Bray stated that the response of the "indignated" to the eviction of their tent camp, direct ordered by Michael Bloomberg, Mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the square and approving the protesters of the tent.
In addition, the "indignated" occupied a new park located at the crossroads of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the Holland Tunnel entrance that connects New York and New Jersey and is owned by the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the town for at least an hour, but afterwards the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray could not give accurate figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists in handcuffs.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had gathered at this spot, where a deployment of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a ground in private property) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing, which is still scheduled for this Tuesday, and in which the legality of the evacuation taking place at dawn is to be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators driven by the square carried and distributed photocopies of this court order, even given to some police officers guarding the square, which resulted in “small clashes,” according to Bray, who reported that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from clearing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as applying “laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that this court order lifted the reopening of the square for public traffic and the protesters and pointed out to the protesters that city laws did not allow them to resettle with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the clearance of Zuccotti square at dawn, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "breached the law."
Bloomberg said he gave the order to clear the square because it had "transformed into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break laws and in some cases to harm others," because "some businesses would have received threats" and the locals "bumped for their quality of life."
“The evacuation at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not in protecting the interests of North American workers,” the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “no respecting freedom of the press.”
Occupy Wall Street officials said they were thinking about organizing “big actions” for Thursday, together with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have lasted since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is on the TV Christmas show the Virgin Mary
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1 on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas".
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbit at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on December 1 on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will breathe a very special virgin Mary's life.
CTV today released pictures of the television program in which Anderson - which also performs for the Internet distribution of a self-filmed porn in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - as a Virgin Mary with a doll in the lap that is meant to portray Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently worked as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" broadcast, appears as a child of Jesus.
CTV’s Christmas program not only focuses on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
At one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently described North American Kim Kardashian as a “horse.”
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still in recovery after the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe Japan has experienced in World War II.
The first estimates by the government in Tokyo estimated the property damage at $300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters of falls, gross domestic product figures from July to September finally completed this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year quota.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan, the financial year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the sale of machines for the rebuilding of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for investments recorded between January and March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual shift in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsia pushes that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan is awake, particularly thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure work.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen – the Japanese currency – has become one of the “refugee currencies” of investors fleeing from the eurozone debt crisis and the blurry forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that lies like a tombstone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, traced their weak business results from July to September to the yen quotation.
While the markets continue to siege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“We need to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrade of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The prospects are really not very encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most member states had clearer signs of slowing economic development in September.
The indicator, which predicts the turning points of the world economy, revealed that the brake would have been pulled at the biggest economic powers.
He dropped four tenths up to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below that average, which is 100, after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens gives rise to doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be passed, but the Conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the higher risk premiums of the peripheral countries and wider uncertainty, Greece continues to get lost in the maze that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a response to pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly evidenced by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon upon his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will support the new measures of austerity and at all revoke his demand for the new elections.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit," Papadimos said yesterday for the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of trust for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's message does not clear doubts about his stance: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he would not endorse a commitment to comply with the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the effects of the poker game with Papandreu's referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that its demand is not to be shaken: Economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "not signed a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The Ministry of Economics spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" of €8,000 million, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knob has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized Spain's "dominant" position with regard to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the role of microfinance worldwide."
Queen Sofía of Spain yesterday recalled that Spain has become the second donor worldwide for this means of international cooperation over the past two decades, based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity on the basis of trust in human beings".
The Queen consecrated yesterday the Fifth World Summit on Microloans in Valladolid and was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the milestone goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "particularly the goal of living under the number of people who have income of less than one dollar on the day".
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly," noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will start from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as mainly beneficial.
“We have seen many successes” and “are facing many challenges.”
The Summit on microloans is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for pushing "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen said it is intended that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty threshold.
The concept of microloans in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described her father as an "admirable idealist committed to fighting poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the local loan strategy.
This experience followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. All of them "we have been able to observe continuous development," explained the queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday brought her the assessment as "Family Head" in Valladolid and as "Speaker of the Poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her lecture by encouraging the attendees to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spain’s Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez said that solidarity is “an ethical commandment” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid in times of economic booms, because it is a "permanent commitment".
Jiménez believed that microloans are a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the developed states should now "more than ever" work on solidarity criteria, and should not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microloans are one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, declared "success", "marginalized" people, "always standing in front of closed doors" "hope" to give and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city, "their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect EU President on the basis of general vote
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig) passed for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulty.
The future of Europe was not originally foreseen in the programme, but it took place in the autumn, in particular to suffice with those activists who consider government policy to be too lax with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow.
The European Commission's proposal for the presidency proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, and ten had abstained.
The several minutes-long standing ovation, which was initially held by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble due to her intervention orders, was open to no doubt on the part of the three finance ministers in favour of Europe.
The Chancellor's main idea, like the requests, is the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could be expressed by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty to the budgetary policy of the countries of the eurozone, which strengthens the control of the European Union; however, this could result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble Pate.
Surely, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been laid.
Similarly, the delegates, by an overwhelming majority, rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the ECB Board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously entail a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The Chancellor's view of calming the climate within her party has therefore strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer attempted to win her Congress at the expense of the "little" or the European countries in difficulty, who would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
To the extent that the European application devotes a paragraph to the significance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France to the plan.
At least not directly.
For this reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, it is one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud represent in illness reporting?
After the family aid, UMP and the government are now starting the illness reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family aid fund and present a speech on the topic of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on an effort to undergo the economy in a hard test, but on the other hand represents no less foreword to a right-wing presidency campaign, the majority wants to concentrate on workers’ illness reports.
First, with a budgetary objective: the government aims to introduce a fourth calendar day before taking into account a illness report for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick worker would lose the four-day salary without the specific company’s permission, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A move that, according to the daily newspaper Les Echos, threatens to provoke anger, but would help to raise 280 million euros.
And that was accompanied by a rather symbolic approach: granting the state officials an unpaid day of care in the case of illness (to date, unlike the three days of care in the private sector, there is no time limit).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also renews the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuse associated with absence from work.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, these will be reimbursed if required," Xavier Betrand warned Sunday, November 13, before RTL's microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of illness reporting seem a little disproportionate.
Indeed, since 2002 it has been the subject of permanent observation and political offensives that have beared the most fruit.
The French are not more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let’s start with the nationwide numbers.
According to the CNAM, more than 237 million euros per day were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Healthcare, the daily allowances in 2008 accounted for 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
Among them, 46% fell in terms of maternity leave and work accidents and 54% in terms of sick leave, which is 6.2 billion euros.
2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, on average only 14.5 sick days were granted to the French.
An average that covers some differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed reported not having taken a single day of illness.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clarifies that 37% of disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days; 15% between 15 days and one month; 15% between one and three months; and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, therefore, French workers are not more likely to be disabled elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global rate of absence (based on disease or otherwise) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in illness reports represents a disappearingly small proportion of black labour.
Only a weak amount of fraud is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on illness reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (Public Higher Education for Technicians and Engineers) found that under 1.5 million checks, 13% of the 285,000 short-term illness registrations realized, which were "unjustified or too long" in 37,050 cases.
In cases of systematically controlled illness reports of more than 45 days of duration, less than 1.2 million 11% were "unfitted or unjustified" cases, namely 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several millions of workers who have applied for an illness registration.
A digit that represents only a weak scale compared to, for example, that of black labour.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a factual report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros in tax profit loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily compensation, and thus significantly more than the fraud in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
This had been announced Monday, November 14, by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament, adding the fact that the one hundred days granted by his government by the Union were not enough to complete this task.
“In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment program,” he said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament’s vote of trust on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "primary task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone "would be at stake," he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the state deficit of the country "by 9%" of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after it stood at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights reject new savings
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had given his approval to the already approved measures on an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but had foreseen that his party would not be prepared to take additional savings.
"We will not vote in favor of new measures," he said at a meeting of deputies of his New Democracy Party.
He had agreed to reduce budget deficits and debt, as well as to combat waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, an economic and monetary commissioner who had prevented the IMF and the EU from unleashing the necessary loan of €8 billion without written assurance from all parties about their support for the planned actions, replied Antonio Samaras that his word would suffice and he would sign nothing under pressure from outsiders.
Euthanasia and accompanied free death must be legalized, according to a panel of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report from the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, including beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in a position of refusal to death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various fields of expertise, including ethics, law and medicine.
This panel recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this election takes place for patients who are deemed capable of making such a decision.
As a start, the experts quote a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which compared death quality in 40 countries around the globe.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “medical death care in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the issue of death.”
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to pain reliever, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians’ desire to die at home, 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From across the country, the highest rate of hospital deaths in Quebec is 86%.
In the delicate question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are in opposition to the position of the federal government, which has already submitted that it does not wish to make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
Now, however, according to the experts, who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization of misconduct in its application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide would be pursued by incompetent or unanimous persons.
On the contrary, there are significantly more cases of such violations especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, confirmed yesterday at a teleconference.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
“Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here,” Downie explains.
Canadians support euthanasia
According to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already responded in favour of euthanasia, as they believe it would allow individuals at the end of their life to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not mean to convey the message that the lives of older or disabled people are less valuable.
Regarding those who have already committed an accompanied suicide, 41% of respondents are of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
Regarding the maintenance or discontinuation of funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Similarly, they suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal of the means for which a legal refusal was provided should not be considered criminal.
The Panel also calls for training health professionals in the task of respecting an end-of-life remedy without having to fear prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, including beyond cancer cases.
Finally, the Panel calls on the means of pain relief or life-end measures that are already widely used in Canadian healthcare institutions to consider at least these, since they, as well as euthanasia, did not serve to reduce physical pain and concern the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already made reservations regarding the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada Expert Report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the reporting experts as "extreme" among other things, since they do not set any limits to the euthanasia practice in patients in the final phase.
“This opens the doors to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years of age asks another person to help him in his suicide,” said RA Deschamps, who had looked through a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual’s own responsibility above all other values that are involved in the social activities of society.
But now, he says, there would be “guides and obligations in a society.”
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she titled a "pro-euthanasy manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular doubts the reports about the absence of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to withdraw from power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Partisan Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the foreign ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, which, thanks to Russia’s support, resists it and shows a “complot” against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League's exclusion of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, despite Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syrian countries, having taken a position in favour of President Assad's resignation.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the acting Arab Prime Minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to “depose his power in Syria” in which about forty civilians and members of the government power were killed.
“If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he would resign, but beyond that he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life,” said the King of Jordan, Syria’s neighbouring country, in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomatic leader Ahmet Davutoglu complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must go," he said, referring to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily rougher stance.
The United States, for its part, has welcomed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" as a result of the Arab League and the European Union's decisions.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have taken an increasingly sharp tone in the face of the repressions in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the governmental power have died in the Dar'a region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed at "Shifts and severe bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless believed that the country "taxes towards the end of the crisis".
He reacted with emphasis to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he believes is a “dangerous step.”
Syria "will not surrender," he added, "the conspiracies forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wishes the deployment of 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers into the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also voted in favour of the dispatch of UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression of his "paranoia".
Tomorrow, in Rabat, there will be a planned re-assembly of the League to discuss the implementation of the crisis rise plan decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial and expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the release of detained demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the Arab League’s decision “incorrect” yesterday to avoid endorsing possible sanctions on Damascus, despite China already warning Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy's
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be willing to sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian government chief, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "victims" demand to regain the credit score lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today’s meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his task to summon a cabinet in parliament, which is composed relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, MEP of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks after meeting with the current President of the Council.
Chairman of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, had been waiting for a vote of trust to the parliament by Friday to make sure the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation of a deletion list, presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock markets and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government program, he stressed, "it is sure that markets will show themselves dull and understanding."
His order by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The current Prime Minister should establish a staff consisting of predominantly technocrats, although he had emphasized that he would also like to involve "politists".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the House of Representatives, the new government should receive the evidence of confidence from Parliament by Friday.
M. Monti has undertaken to work urgently in the sense of the goal of making Italy a "renewed protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change even in the light of the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of budget compensation in 2013 despite the savings plans taken up in recent months, has in particular requested new harshness measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of Italy's heads, who will meet on Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic boost, as a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficit indicators."
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "epoch change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the lead authors.
The greatest unknown here is the longevity of its rod.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, since Italy has to pay for 200 billion euros of government bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Energy Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-weapon-usable explosive capsule, an American NGO specializing in nuclear hazards confirmed on Monday.
The ISIS Institute of Science and International Security is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Nuclear Security IAEA and other documents coming from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The IAEA announced last week its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to in-depth study of the IAEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently had worked at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he was supposed to have left the center to start a company in Kiev that produces "nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentioned "strong evidence that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system "was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only highly skilled in this technique, but also, as a member of the state told the agency, his entire career on this technology essentially worked directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes have either declined slightly or increased slightly in the same period, according to FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased by 49% from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, while there was a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The overall number of “hate-motivated crimes” has risen to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again,” the human rights organization Human Rights First emphasized. “The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant,” the organization added in a communiqué.
“Human Rights First had long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a leader of the organization.
“The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving the police attitude toward the ‘hate crimes’.
The "hate crime" is represented in federal American law as an inheritance from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence against race, colour, religion or ancestry and now also involve crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing the platform and resembling more and more Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter on Monday introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those following their entries, which makes the service resemble once again that of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" enable better readable live tracking of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and who track your messages.
This allows you to find out whether they allow you to track your messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was tested prior to its general Internet spread on Monday “in August with a small percentage of users,” Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, filled with something esotherically anmutenden Wortlaut (RT zum referenzten Wiederholen der Posts von einem anderen Personen). followfriday to recommend follow another user) doing the heureux des insiders, thus opens a larger audience with a maneuverment more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users debated about this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" via the Internet.
“This is useless, intrusive and resembles too much Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
“The ‘Activity’ feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter,” @dannykronstrom said.
Austrian
Entry of a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution
The Austrian government of the Great Social Democratic/Christ Democratic Coalition decided on Tuesday to incorporate a "Golden Budget Rule" into the Constitution to reduce public deficits and also avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top-ranking (AAA)
It was highly personally Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian state debt is at 74.6%, well above the criterion of 60% set by the Treaty of Maastricht, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s creditworthiness had not fallen from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest each year,” said Michael Spindelegger, deputy chancellor and Christian Democratic foreign minister.
Austria also holds a call at the Brussels Summit of the Eurozone Member States on October 26: the heads of state and government at that time would have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public account balance in the Constitution or by passing an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government in this regard is similar to the "German model", since Germany had been the first European country to incorporate such a "rule" into the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states and municipalities should have balanced households.
The aim is to eliminate budgetary debt within the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese government would intervene again in currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we see an excessive volatility in the yen exchange rate, we will intervene as much as we did the last time," Noda said in a statement.
On Tuesday, the yen was again close to the historical levels that Japanese authorities forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen for dollars to lower the Japanese currency value, which is on the verge of a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has risen regularly over it, doped up by purchases from investors who view the yen as a "refuge worth" in these uncertain times of global economic decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has slipped below the symbolic latte of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar traded around the 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency harms the archipelago’s exports, as it expensives the cost of “Made in Japan” products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
“Japan is struggling for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region in the north-east,” said Noda, who fears that this worsening of the yen could already kill the weak upturn in the germ.
With growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - the third world economic power has gained traction for the first time this year thanks to the jumping export increases and the consumption of households "plombed" by the disaster.
The Prime Minister, however, estimates that the decline of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
For his part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to defeat the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, however, informed the BoJ that it had already initiated "appropriate measures", making it apparent that on Wednesday there was no additional currency loosening to be expected.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its state bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to redeem the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of coverage it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest feet quickly rise, exchanges make withdrawers
The risk of infection from the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the opening of the new leaders in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, also drifted a little more into negative fields on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and dropped to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, while London decreased by 0.1%.
“Due to new tensions regarding the returns of government bonds in the Eurozone in difficulty, global stock markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
“Investors are nervous and are only too well aware of the risk of infection,” said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of market participants that the debt crisis will continue in Europe, had closed with a 0.7% drop.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has looked at Europe, and trade is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation has stabilized," said Mitsushi Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concerns about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European Valuta was worth 1.3570 dollers, so it dropped 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange brokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which met in Congress on Monday, accepted a request, which in particular provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italy’s and Spain’s loan interest rates are still at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds reached 6.85% at 10 years, and that of Spanish title matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the South, but also in France, continue to nurture investors’ fears.
Future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy threatened by debt burden.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions made at the Eurozone Summit on October 27 was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the sight of the markets as parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread of interest between the German and Spanish 10-year obligations has once again reached a new historical high.
Expecting Eurozone growth figures
Statistically, France reported a household consumption-driven economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, ergo slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the decline in figures in the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts most.
Germany, in turn, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate of the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m., warning the EU Commission of the risk of a re-recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is a topic that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to hold an electoral meeting for the sake of reflecting on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be fruitful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is pushing forward a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, so that a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity on a constant basis, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate, in order to combat climate irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to live in isolation in its decision to waive nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a substitutable replacement source, nor in Switzerland, which is just planning to build only last-generation nuclear power plants.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, continue to follow their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, decided after Fukushima to add another unit to its park by re-starting the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model focused on renewable energy sources is occasionally set as a model, however, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will reflect in the form of an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on Russia, especially due to the increased use of import gas, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives reason to think.
On the one hand, Denmark is a European leader in wind energy, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, and on the other hand, it is one of the most powerful users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 outputs and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the continuity of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill as opposed to our French households.
Since energy prices in the globalized economy play a key role in competitiveness as well as in the stability of industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a sharp rise in energy prices, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys showed that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are not as willing to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let’s note that our country’s energy policy has enabled an industry to build with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a multitude of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them the creator of countless jobs.
If France decided to withdraw from nuclear power, a majority of these SMEs would be victimized and the annual exports of investment goods and nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would entrust an EPR designed to operate for sixty years if the decline of its producer was preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is as little as a devil’s work a miracle to generate electricity.
The low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear and renewable energy, developed by Areva, testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of security is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks on existing plants such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their teams, who have made themselves a name because of their professionalism, are obsessed with the safety concept.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, entered under normal operating conditions; so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was summoned up by reactor construction as well as indefinite, human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two unprecedented natural disasters that killed several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident just as much as it did after the two previous ones.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a design that enables it to be resistant to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF, allowing them to take the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to have emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles – overburdened by police, courts and administrative bodies on the basis of a policy subject to the numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a “country of human rights” as France had titled itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the official side had shaped the weekly publications, the Minister of the Interior had occasionally announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "needs no talent, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a far-reaching consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, should not pose a problem for a country", on the left side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "could not seize all the world's poverty".
The only difference is in the degree of motion
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided from both right and left in 2005.
Both camps perceived immigrants as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit to immigrants.
François Hollande is limited in his program to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on elections; however, it is economically expensive.
Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S., there is a broad consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of immigration and economic influence on immigration.
Restricting immigration would undermine growth and damage the labour market situation.
Fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace local workers, especially those with low skills, by putting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than local wage workers, as they may focus on carrying out jobs in sectors that are technically unemployed.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that irritate local wage workers little, more qualified immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists, this complementarity also has a positive effect between locals and migrants of immigration access on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
In this way, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in immigrant flood will result in a co-involved, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of idea creation and economic growth brought by immigrants is beneficial (high share of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to the social systems, on average around 1% of the overall budget in the European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 years on average makes a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to make the missing intersections "with the teeth" when he entered his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which should deter the immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had brought the entire 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some believed that it was sufficient to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy overcome its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon's "little one" that it was a trait of mindset.
The general electoral right, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can as well become an "instrument of oppression" as was expressed by the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, education, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe we are facing is an economic crisis, but it is also a political and democracy crisis, first and foremost.
The change of mind in the Greek truth-false referendum would have had a double-recognizing character in this regard: once that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but on the other hand also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its impropriety.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for a success of the national referendum, which was organized depending on the necessities and in the wrong order.
A free ticket for the European alone ruler or a jump with close eyes into the emptiness of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, in full law, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you don't know, by the way, where to end the listing - because there is only one crisis, and this crisis prevails in Europe.
It is all Europe that bows to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, that suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - it is all of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus each of the nations that are associated with it.
The urgency is to give people's sovereignty back to the leadership of the European project.
It is all about whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from markets and drive a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is a condition for decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic righteousness without surely leading us to destruction.
After a long time of fighting against this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, today everyone is pushing for European economic leadership.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it proposes to the citizens - would be a new foolishness and a new blind alleyway.
We have to take a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the republic in France, it was necessary to "create" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not suffice here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European national sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become general
The world chip card fair opens its doors in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude on Tuesday.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with a 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that enables payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide this year!
Its market share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining on the ground in terms of contactless payments after a long time behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
However, consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move to a higher speed, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing over to their customers bank cards equipped with contactless chip in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, General Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by cell phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearingly small percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"They've been late."
"But they should at least experience a real upward development next year."
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
The banks are taking initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are expected to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE is running a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also testified yesterday to prepare the launch of an offer that allows its customers to pay contactlessly by cell phone.
Terrorist Front, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The long-suspected relations between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now gained "certainty" about this.
"The way in which both organizations act and the relations of the intelligence agencies point to clear cooperation," he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has brought to light interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, were reportedly killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators wanted to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the site of operation.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of guided phone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had stayed long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but you have to undoubtedly wait for more clear evidence before you can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
“It is conceivable.”
“It has been known for years that the sect is receiving financial and intellectual support from outsiders and that it is increasingly active,” Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo said.
In recent months, these "supports" have become more and more apparent in their course, as well as Boko Harem's speeches and operational modes, which now indicate the addition of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives that carry the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the International Community has been putting pressure on Abuja to address the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the grouping as a community of Illuminati, to which no special attention should be paid.
Fast Success
Founded in Maiduguri in 2002, around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram – which in Haoussa means “western education is a shame” – follows the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
The merger is rapidly succeeding in this low-income region.
She politicizes herself and demands strict adherence to the Sharia as the activists joined her engage in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists first targeted churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s activists were particularly active with their intensified attacks on the commissionariates.
However, Abuja’s reaction is, as usual, indifferent.
The army surrounds the city and counts 800 dead.
The captive Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination in Jos, which killed 80 people, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram was blamed for a suicide bombing that took place at the secured police headquarters in Abuja – the first of its kind.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters becomes a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which will lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has disturbed all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, Somalis operating from al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned Jonathan of Boko Harem on the occasion of a talk with President Goodluck in Nigeria and showed himself ready to communicate all clues.
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplifying and ignoring China, Iraq and helping Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead to a complex world with simple, not to say, simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate in this way, voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow fighters have repeatedly made their thunderous statements as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional Republican emphasis.
Slogans fall over China, Iran and Israel’s aid – often not underpinned in any way.
Mitt Romney, the highest in the course of the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation" - the leading issue in an America that is most irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
It went stupid if this is meant to imply the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost turned off on his emotion-flattering behavior.
He had called for a hand-held, but constructive exchange of conversations with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not answered as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's Ebenbild
Romney also vowed for military strikes against Iran if sanctions to stop the nuclear program fail.
"If I'm elected, I'm ordering Iran to stop," he said.
“When Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb.”
He also promised more military aid to Israel and accused Obama of remaining guilty to this partner’s obligations.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest-placed candidate, in turn showcases an embarrassing file ignorance.
Recently, he called for a contrary to the Chinese military threat, as Beijing "trys to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military beatings against Iran, for his part, is strongly prepared to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The resort to torture against presumed terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War despite this.
They recall that Obama himself was also an amateur and had to add water to his wine on the topic of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive talk with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his “boys” from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
However, this refinement is not quite so unenforced.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance sheet of national security under Obama, which bin Laden has shut down.
Since Iraq, she has been shielding herself from military interventions leading to decline.
And Obama is more adequately surprised by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to bring his leadership position to life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas line, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with glory and glory.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas line, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level on Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestra sounding and at Finschmeckerbuffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically jointly turned the control of the valve that transports Russian gas into the western European network.
The new gas pipeline is expected to deliver 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year through a first pipeline of 1,224 km long which connects the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the total consumption of France - is expected to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of the construction of a third line sound on your own route.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building is a victory.
The project was very controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any routes through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: for them it will now be more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not reluctant to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is extremely sensitive from a political point of view.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of a reduction in European energy, as the project has broken between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in enforcing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries that have high gas consumption and are slowing down their gas deposits.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way,” said Fillon at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing to the extent to which the major gas contracts are also important from a political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply line.
The construction of this gas transmission line is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete shell, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 meters deep.
In their construction, mine fields dating from the Second World War had to be evacuated.
“About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed for precautionary purposes,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
Furthermore, increased measures to protect fauna and flora had to be taken.
The line is a long metal line, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which has been interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers differed from it, as the Swedes were little eager to see a Russian state society permanently settling at the height of their coasts.
"In the event of a havarie, we will close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller said.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas transmission pipe escapes to the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be only unlikely, since the silent seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled from a seaship for external observation purposes, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, measuring a meter in diameter, is inserted into the interior of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entrance point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group of companies GDF Suez (each 9%).
These five companies have formed a corporate community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas line.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom has then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company on a renewable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the quantity of real-life gas is," said Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas transmission construction was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are sure to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone carries the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline appears on a sandy coastline wooded with pine trees near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas exit gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas lines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Started by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to add new style to writing.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent in candlelight writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular cover, rubber strap, egg-shaped sides, as it aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, headquartered in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a specialist consultant for the company, is tasked with launching the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin, which denotes a cotton coat used, for example, for covering upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that until the 20th century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists,” explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes.
Between 2006 and 2010 sales increased by 26% and established with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of buyers, as the notebook excites business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs more than 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in city centres and is committed to enforcing its identity.
“We followed the spirit of time and its new need for writing, which exists despite the boom of emails,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (Umweg)", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a cover with leopard patterns on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit of time and knew how to diversify his products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer covers... The brand has the entire range of items.
In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today’s Syntegra Capital, opening up a new chapter in Moleskine’s history.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th Week of Work for Disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average: 19% versus 9% unemployment for the overall population.
Disheartening?
"No," emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the 'Week of Work for Disabled'.
“The progress made in fifteen years is considerable.”
“The unemployment rate was not twice as high then, but three times as high.”
“Notwithstanding, there is still so much to do.”
However, it must be said that for disabled unemployed people, many obstacles remain before they get a job.
It is more common for older people: 37% are older than 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school and there are only 10,000 disabled among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to re-enter work, and that form the "core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992, which helps companies to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the actual brakes.
The unspoken remains, the mental attitudes that are certainly developing, but still slowly developing.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entrepreneur for the journal La Cité stated that the surveyed managers have “a low level of knowledge regarding disabled persons” that is “over-represented” by “persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually underprivileged”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way ahead to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled employees, which was set out in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, dating from 2008, indicate a ratio of 2.6%.
“We are now at about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization that is tasked with collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
The evidence: The number of "paying fees" at establishments has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts deposited between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which provides for tax increases, created a strong pressure on companies,” said Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also expresses real knowledge, especially in the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the facilities between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a luck"
Already before the "Blue Tuesday nights" (20:45) offered the forehead, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide their pleasure, which brought them the friendly match.
It would have gone too far to claim that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectators’ podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard would have been able to make peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had reaped nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," said the native Liller.
As for the contrast between his representation in the club and the national league, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
“I’m in Lille all year round, which isn’t the case in Belgium.”
“It’s time for me to start.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "glow".
However, without refrain from the note of "pleasure".
He fired the French national team since the age of 7 and led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been supported,” he said.
This inevitably contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there."
“We just walked the way.”
"To be able to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, sounded "prideful".
"The Pride of a Galamatch."
"Proudness" also to confirm - in his capacity as "neighbours" - that France "has once again become a team at very high level", and that just over a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job,” he said.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician sees most likely sharing the plane with the Blues (the French national league) ... and that to Brazil in 2014.
“We little Belgians come out big,” he said.
“We’re planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You will notice this in the upcoming games." The match against France was involved.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the return against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the end of the game, both teams lacked the factuality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest approach of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, this means just 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and to reserve an opponent, namely Bosnia.
Given the back-game (0-0) on Friday in Zenica's Hell, it seems obvious that the dice have not fallen yet.
Portugal dominated the game clearly for more than an hour, but the team was unable to push the case the stamp so important that would have taken the pressure from it.
“This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we haven’t scored a goal away.”
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to beat themselves in front of an audience that is likely to be equally hot on the game, even if the game has of course been announced as "very short," said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
“We expect a very short match, but we are totally convinced that we will be able to win the top,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We continue to have a 50% chance of being at the 2012 European Championship,” Carlos Queiroz’s successor said.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
“This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we haven’t scored a goal away,” Bento said.
"We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese planned to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "give them no time to reflect".
A good idea, on the condition that it will be implemented this time.
