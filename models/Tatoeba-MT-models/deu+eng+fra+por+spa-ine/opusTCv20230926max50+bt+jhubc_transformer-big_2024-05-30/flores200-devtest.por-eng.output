The U.S. gym team supports the charter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and agrees with the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, can be better served by moving forward with significant changes within our organization, rather than decertification.

This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already well accepted, but also offers details that are not found so often in fossils, such as colors and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper feather of this animal was brown and the lower part was clear or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues to the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaur feathers, known as rack, do not have a well-developed rod, but have other characteristics, such as farps and barbulas. In view of this, the researchers concluded that rack was possibly the result of evolutionary development after these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather to display or regulate the temperature. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample has the feathering of an adult, not that of a puppy.
The researchers suggested that despite the tail being of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult plumage, not a peony.

The work done was, for the most part, theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team sought would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matters in the same way as normal matter.
This theory claims that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a species of aureola and is composed of several tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region in South Africa.
He warned that the new variant was “very worrying and alarming about the fact of the high mortality rate,” in an interview.
According to Dr. Moll, some patients may have contracted the virus in the hospital and at least two were healthcare professionals.
Within a period of one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 nearby contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still appears to be low; 6,000 out of a group of 330,000 individuals infected at any time in South Africa.

Infrared images show that night temperature variations per day indicate that they are likely caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
“Their thermal behavior is not as stable as the large caves on planet Earth, which usually preserve a very constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are large depth holes in the soil,” said Glen Cushing, of the Astrogeology Team at the United States Geological Service (USGS) and the University of North Arizona, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and lay a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the poll and signs the voting list.
French electoral legislation codes the procedures in a pretty rigorous manner.
Since 1988, the polls must be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that no envelope is present at the beginning of the poll and that no envelope is added, except for those of duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process. During the night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Madhya Pradesh Police have recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss and retrieved their cell phone and laptop."
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki declared.
Even though three people were inside the house when she was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the red Audi TT driver.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in Edinburgh's Sheriff's Court since then, accused of the murder of her son.
She is in custody while awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence of eyewitnesses may be compromised because her image has been widely disclosed.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland’s justice acts differently, and courts consider posting photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists seem to go in a dangerous direction when they post photos, videos, etc. of suspects.”
The Crown Office, which is generally in charge of the proceedings, has told journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants based on borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other subjects covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred for both countries, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years as soon as an agreement is signed, while the AP agrees to leave that presence for only five years.
Snipers in the supplemental pest control test were closely supervised by forest engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, according to the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS Interim Director of Conservation and Park Heritage, the four snipers selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly promised a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the CEP’s prior resignation as part of a package of measures to move the country forward to new elections.
The committee was Martelly’s response to the general protests organized against the regime, which began in October.
The occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with light burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, the METI released that Apple had reported another 34 overheating incidents, which the company classified as “non-serious.”
The ministry responded by calling the delay of Apple’s report “truly regrettable.”
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19pm local time. In GMT time, it was on Friday at 21:19pm.
The Northern Marianas emergency management office said there was no damage reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Alert Center said there was no indication of tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer kidnapped a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostages in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed as dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier, as well as Philippine photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an old lady who had to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He educated himself as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Although she was working in the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in her free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the baby’s fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Moon was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first businesswoman. Luna passed away on a night with two moons. Something exceptional, just like her. Strong woman."
Dustin Goldust Runnels said, "The moon was as crazy as I was ... or perhaps even more ... I loved her and will miss her ... take her in a better place."
Among the 1,400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those who oppose change in Australia for it to become a republic has grown by 8% since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 campaign for the national election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's kingdom.
34 percent of those who participated in the survey share this view, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was expected to swim in the 100 and 200 free meters and in three rounds at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was put into doubt.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to overcome the pain, as these are prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the Central University of Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets have been a source of water distribution to the ground along with organic matter that can develop protein and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how the planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since the comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his government earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as “political and nonsense.”
It is speculated that he will run for the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would let aircraft fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon production.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to oldest ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transportation and the surface trains will not stop in Wembley. Parking and public transport connections will not be available.
The problem of the lack of transport increased the possibility that the game would have to be played in closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
On Thursday, the journal Science published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the US and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic tentilla Darwin, Strong Geospiza, and the tentilla immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in any form. It can even be wrapped in small formats.
It is possible to stretch to form a thin yarn, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or wrapped in leaves.
It can be very thin and glued to another metal. Because it is so thin, it was sometimes used to decorate paintings painted by hand in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called chemical PH. You can make a marker using purple cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have their electrons removed (since the hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, mold them into the shape of a ball.
The moisture of the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange feeling and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a toilet seat with discharge in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remaining parts of sewage systems were found in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in Ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathrooms, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then redirects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
A giant rocket over 30 meters tall is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in amazing ways. The biggest thing the wheel did for us was to give us a much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car and several other forms of transport.
Below them are medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antilopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat small, much more numerous animals such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The revelation to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social felines, living in large groups called alkateas.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males of the same family, along with up to 30 females and puppies.
Women are often closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion slaughters act similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, jump large distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genre Panthera) as lions, leopards and ounces. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roaring of a tiger is not like the roaring of a lion’s voice, but more like a phrase of screaming and screaming words.
Jaguars like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that jaguars hunt are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe the jaguatirics follow and find their prey by smell, smelling where they have been in the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also manage to move stealthily. Jaguars hunt their prey by mixing with the environment around them and then attack their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (e.g. if they transpose a mountain chain or a river, or if they go to an island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in an environment different from that in which they lived before.
This new environment has different features and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics than they already have and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less similar to the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will seem so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process of speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale)
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also offer shadow.
We build our homes using plants and we make our clothes using plants. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mosassaurus was the alpha predator of his era, so the only thing he feared was other Mosassaurs.
His long jaws were crawled with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the sky of his mouth, showing that nothing that crossed his way could escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had a forked tongue. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosassaurs and may even have been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not be matched to him.
Although most of their foods were familiar to us, the Romans still had their quota of strange or unusual foods such as wild boar, peacock, snail and a type of rodent called arganaz.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to hold banquets together where they were lying aside while eating their meals.
Food in ancient Rome did not include supplies originating from America and Asia to Europe, as was the case in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomato, no potato, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which were considered the house of their respective gods.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an internal sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramids in the shape of towers, called zigurates, were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, the shops were only open counters facing the street. Stones were used in the construction of the houses.
There were no great forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
In the Nordic sagas, they say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, found Greenland and gave it that name.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavians", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie The Legend of the Lost Treasure, you may find that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, head-down.
Although no one knows exactly who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, the large scroll document (it measures 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches per 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on Day D liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy", who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the American and Free France forces had released southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civils, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and that also somehow defines the size of society.
Cities-states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization depicts the passing of knowledge through different generations, a lasting cultural reach and a fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—the Congress being its only component—according to the Confederation Articles.
The Congress lacked power to demand taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it trusted the state authorities, which generally did not cooperate, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, there was no authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles needed unanimous consent between all states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
The Italian football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, skating and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago"
Taiwan's foundation dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans who sailed through the region named the site as Formosa Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the west and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they were originally.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of static image photography on the planet is that of 35 mm, which was the film size that had the most in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
Currently it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its proportion was inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The format in 35mm is actually confusingly shaped, 36mm wide by 24mm height.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the lowest ratio between integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal or very close to that ratio.
The rather abused and often demoralized third party law is a rather simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, went through scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christian religion has united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
All were affected by their influencers, from the king to the plebes.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church’s money funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central leadership of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective, with the cutting of vital supplies of military and civilians, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international regulations and set forth in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to neutral flagship ships.
Germany, since there was a limited response to this tactic, expected an attack similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the war during World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States without a fee, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the chief of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different times; each stage of China or every family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable era of divided provinces. The most known of these periods was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China's history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, vacancies were opened to all male candidates, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since instead of patents based on social class, they now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed workers from other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to attend a cave that became known as "Hira" in the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Residing at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
It is not possible to see anything but the clear blue sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Gizeh is the only of the seven wonders in the world that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Plato de Gizeh, or the "Necropolis of Gizeh", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (including the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, various temples and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "bow pointing up" mark has its similar appearance with a V, and the "bow pointing down" mark has its similar appearance with a clip or a square without the bottom side.
Top means you should start at the tip and push the bow; low means you should start at the heel (which is the place where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general, an arc up produces a softer sound, while an arc down produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but don’t forget that printed arch notes exist for a musical reason, so these should be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Mary Antonieta, his two young children (Maria Teresa, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four years old) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris, departing from Versailles, by a crowd of women from the markets.
In a chariot, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and screaming threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage well open.
At one point, a protester waved with the head of a dead royal guard in Versailles in front of the queen, terrified.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds with floating rates on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippine people would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of order.
The time when such events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Low Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a series of ideas in practice, from the supply of technology or the technological imperative to a strict notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: the first is that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; the second, is the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that the car necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for only a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of having a car.
The possession of mass cars leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health system to heal injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be shaped and, over time, the customs and culture linked to this geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the place of society, became better than the eventually mandatory laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the participants of the Crusade returned bringing gifts like silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital took place from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic language reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
In the beginning, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west may remain behind for 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began developing its own style. One of the greatest advances for the time was that, as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is the agriculture carried out for the production of sufficient food to satisfy only the needs of farmers and their families.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, generally organic system that uses kept seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals of similar mentality who feel neglected by the standards of society and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be different due to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargons.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to resort to the little lamentable cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, not socialized by adults as they were growing up.
These children are called "ferocious" or wild. Some of these children have been confined by people (usually by parents themselves); in some cases, the abandonment of this child has resulted in the rejection of the child by parts of the parents because of their severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are revolted may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood before being abandoned or fleeing home.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; they say some lived on their own in the jungle.
When fully raised by animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular pet, such as his fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid for students who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or face-to-face, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that little speaking Microsoft Office clip.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized into the software with the aim of questioning, alerting and explaining procedures that can be challenging for the student to deal with alone.
Children are placed in nursing homes for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not nourish, care and educate, but that happens.
We see the Family Care System as a safety zone for these children.
Our adoption platform has the duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed health care.
Adoptive care is supposed to meet all the needs that were missing in the house from which it was taken.
The internet combines elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational characteristics by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is alleged that a person can detect whether another person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The Speech of the President, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are, despite this, able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such human behavior interpretation skills can be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and manifest.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the express variation cluster.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans, consuming the available plant resources, to meet their amino acid requirements.
In addition, failure to act accordingly has serious consequences: severe depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The resources of plant origin with greater accessibility would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for us, primates, to digest, unless they are cooked.
However, animal foods (ants, cupins, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide large amounts of protein that contain all essential amino acids.
Taking all this into account, it wouldn’t be surprising if our own ancestors solved their “protein problems” more or less as the current savanna chimpanzees do.
Sleep disruption is a process that consists of waking up deliberately during the normal period of sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done using a quiet alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up at once.
If you see yourself resetting the clock while sleeping, it can be placed across the bedroom, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other possibilities based on biorhythm include drinking plenty of liquid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person’s level of inner peace correlates opposite to his level of body and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enlarged by the path of love of the Mahayana and by many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of comprehensive love.
With Yoga Kundalini, the Kundalini energy (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to the cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the clashes of systems, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years and, in fact, there would be replacement troop leadership on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans became almost obsolete overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union Red Army created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Agression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The work of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that its country maintains the ability to displace population and assets while at the same time interfering with the ability of its enemies to move their own people and assets.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic battle of World War II. Americans were trying to displace men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy organization, using mostly U-boats, was trying to end this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have the ability to conquer Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began maintaining them in order to facilitate access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that walked in the hills or other pasture areas, often cared for by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the most known shepherd. These methods of shepherd are still used today.
The wagonways were built in England from the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and carry larger loads on slightly more accidental roads.
Sleeps were implemented well in the beginning, to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it was realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cover at the top.
This became a common practice, but iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began walking erect two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedality adaptations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago. However, the Sahelanthropus may have walked on both legs, long before, seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't want to have only a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems and end them.
It is obvious enough that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of man.
Following adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten sketch signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to a few blocks away for a print of John Dunlap.
During the night there were around 150 to 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap attacks that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handmade copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive to this day. We call them birds.
Many people don’t think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two rear legs, like a T-rex.
Almost all computers currently used are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number may have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
The internal poisoning may not be apparent immediately. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The greatest sign of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container with medication or toxic chemicals for domestic use.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to this particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to treat this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects structured enough to be stuck in humans.
Both barbers and bedbugs are nidcules, adapted to live in nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease in young and adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their interest, or that of their child.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. It is this method that guides scientific research.
It is not, in fact, just experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, asking questions. Making observations also guides a scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, the Latin Bible.
All Aristotle’s scientific thoughts were accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek retreated, the West was far from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various rhythms observed in physiology and behavior typically depend primarily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are absolutely not a response to external periodic stimuli, have been observed for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological watches are self-sustainable oscillators that will continue to operate for a period of continuous cycle, even without the interferences of the environment.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in the bacteria.
They did two experiments that marked either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting nature areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, seeing birds, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
An example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, by car, people leave small towns in the inland to go to work in other towns, and meet other people who work precisely in those small towns where they left.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a private car-based transportation system.
The science today points out that this carbon-based economy has shifted the biosphere of the stable state that had allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone also complains of these transportation systems.
In developed countries, similar levels of water quality or bridge fall complaints are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the analysis of the driving of drivers and individual vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the traffic flow is difficult because the driver’s behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in planning, design and operations of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to go into the air. Their ability to fly helped them easier escape enemies and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot bend their wings back are libellulas and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said the Solar System was moving around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because the planet Earth doesn't seem like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes nearly 10 km wide.
A total of 20% of the water that goes from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River has 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ancient Empire, the pyramids of Gizeh were never exceeded in size and in construction technical excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed at the buildings of their predecessors, which were until then far over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City has about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its official legislation and communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because all can be discovered in nature in natural form and are relatively simple to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although it has also theorized that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
It is considered that elements such as calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also get alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
All things in the Universe are made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so astonishingly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was released.
Unfortunately, as new method of writing appeared, the pencil became relegated to a less important paper and use.
Currently, people write messages through computer screens and don’t need to get close to a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something newer emerges.
The fission pump functions based on the principle that energy is needed to build a core with several protons and neutrons.
It's more or less like riding a heavy trolley up a hill. The division of the core again releases, then some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the moon is composed of stones and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more maria on the nearest side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories analyze what is in certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment will cause them to do certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Theory of Two Factors.
In general terms, two behaviors can emerge as managers start leading their former co-workers. One side of the spectrum tries to stay as "part of the group of guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary measures, making performance assessments, delegating and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person becomes an individual impossible to recognize himself that he feels that he must change everything the team has done and do his own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behaviour ends in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members usually act as the contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be in varying time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization wish to go through the difficult process of establishing an organizational learning? One of the practical objectives of the concepts of organizational learning is innovation.
When all the available resources are effectively used by all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity transpare.
As a result, the process of an organization working in a team to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer’s need.
Even before an organization is innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations reach higher levels in their performances.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, thus narrowing the area of research and making it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology underpins scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to meet customer questions and diagnoses, as well as the recognition of writing, voice, and speech.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the areas of economics, medicine, engineering and military, as it is integrated into various home computer software applications and video games.
Study visits are very important for any school class. Often, teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
The technology offers the solution with virtual field classes. From the classroom, students can see museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a tour virtually is also a great way to reflect on a tour and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students from Bennet School, North Carolina, develop a website about their journey to the state capital. Every year, the site is remodeled, but older versions are kept online to serve as a souvenir book.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Since students often start their contact with blogs using bad grammar and spelling, so the presence of an audience usually changes this.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable of the world around them." The need to feed the interest of the public inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Writing in blogs is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can make students more analytical and critical; interacting with Internet content actively, students can position themselves in the context of others' writings, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a series of art galleries and museums that demonstrate the Canadian past and present.
The Niagara Falls are farther south; the north already boasts the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and much more.
Because of all this and much more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also quite sparsely populated and some are practically uninhabited in nature.
For a population comparison question that surprises many people: there are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are in the Indian Ocean, a distance from the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent alone, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxurious beach hotels.
The Arabs also brought to the lands Islam, which gained great popularity in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the fifteenth century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Road of Europe to India.
In the north, the region is limited by the Sahel, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all travellers say they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (just not one that seems too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can cause acts that they would regard as harassment, and it is not unusual to be followed, gripped by the arm, etc.
Be firm when refusing men. Don't be afraid to stand firm (whether for cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's all right!).
The modern town of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenidas as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name of the White House, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which received the name of Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Close to the historic part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan merchandise such as tagines, ceramic, leather articles, narguiles and more a lot of buggigangos, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano lava, which buried a large part of the city's streets, mainly the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma must be studied to understand the state of battle that persists in the province of Nord-Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain trails with gorillas in Africa.
You can use a wedding (mototaxi) to walk around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a quick ride.
"Timbuktu" became used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, in view of its relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city despite its reputation making it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of endangered heritage of humanity due to the danger of the desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World, broadcast on PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the rest of the country because it has a more Arabic than African touch.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each sustaining different animal species.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flag of South African National Parks (SANparks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, as is the case with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very helpful to purchase a Wild Card. With it you can have access to several parks in South Africa or all of the South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that form the horizon of Hong Kong has already been compared to a glittering bar chart that is made visible by the presence of the Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the edge of Kowloon on the opposite side.
Most of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is densely concentrated on recovered land along the northern coast.
This is the place the British settlers chose to live and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory’s colonial past, this is a great place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest mangrove strip in the world, extending for 80 km (50 mi) towards the inland of Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park
But the forests don’t only count on mangrove swamps – they have some of the last large jungles that have already covered the remaining gangetic surface.
The Sundarbans covers a length of 3,850 square kilometres, one-third of which is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer seen in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
As interdistrict buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal microbuses, which are comfortable and resistant.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a bridge that crosses the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, in Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long and two slopes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical break under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to enter operation in September 2017, the date scheduled for completion of customs inspections in Brazil.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, living as seminomade hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived on hunting, collecting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Province of the Indias", emerged from the encounter of Spanish conquerors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period that lasted three centuries.
Since the creation of Assumption in 1537, Paraguay has achieved success in the permanence of many of its characteristics and identity of the indigenous populations.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and pole players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentina Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to a British pound (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands that is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are accepted.
In remote islands, it is unlikely that credit cards will be accepted, although British and American currencies may be received. Please contact the owners in advance to know what payment method they accept.
It is virtually impossible to change the current currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below the freezer, but the combined wind and humidity make the feeling colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park’s animals are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of the park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/metre from the bears and wolves, and 25 yards/metre from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, elk and bear, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they haven’t kept an adequate distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so don’t come closer.
Furthermore, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, however, avoid loading or cooking foods with strong smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the stage of a known naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave it.
All ships were sinked, except for a cruiser from Britain, and nearly 200 lives of Germans and Americans perished.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the murder of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland standing between two coves. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches on the north coast (in the North Harbour district) are bathed by the Pacific Ocean and range from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shadows coming from the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on Waitemata Harbour in the sophisticated suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are, sometimes, family beaches crowded with a wide variety of shops around the coast. Swimming is quite safe.
The main local beer is the Number One. It's not a prepared beer, but it's delightful and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines can go down better.
Local plumbing water is completely safe for consumption, but it is easy to find bottled water if you are afraid.
For Australians, the concept of "flat white" coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate conforms to Belgian standards. Natural juices are expensive, but great.
Many trips to the reef are made all year round, and injuries for any of these causes, which occur at the reef, are rare.
Keep observing the reminders of the authorities, obeying all the signs and paying great attention to safety alerts.
The cubomedusa occurs near river beaches and estuaries, from October to April, north of 1770. They can occasionally be found in other periods.
Sharks really exist, but rarely attack humans. Most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean; their main habitat are the estuaries of the rivers that lie north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives the traveler the confidence that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often do business with specific hotels, however much it may be possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, by a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even packages combined with flights and hotels.
They can also secure your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g., visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, this should first be forwarded to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants decide to camp on site, and most of them consider this a fundamental part of the experience.
If you want to stay close to the action, you will have to arrive early to be able to camp near the music.
Remember that even after the closure of the music on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue to play until late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, check the cabin’s location, as when you cross the ice a terrible noise is generated for the most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include city tours. Passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. In general, there are no windows or watches, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep guests in good mood and to keep them on site.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages at home, however, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good bettors know the importance of maintaining sobriety.
Whenever someone drives in places with high latitudes or on highways above the mountains, they should consider the possibility of facing snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is low, and you can’t drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During snowfall, it is possible to fall enough snow to leave you stuck in very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced due to snow falling or winding, or by condensation or ice in the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the largest tourist attraction in Africa and the girl of the eyes of many visitors.
The term "safari", in its colloquial use, refers to land trips to observe the impressive African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars and the basic equipment enables good visualization.
Lions, ghepards, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you’ll see them better with binoculars.
Also known as "walking in the woods", "walking safari" or "passed", a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympic Games will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021. Some events will be hosted in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you have scheduled your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay is announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but at the end of March most cancellation policies due to coronavirus did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with normal tickets costing about 7,000 yen.
Wet clothes can help dry up. Many hotels have iron and loan board, even if there is no one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you don’t like to wear past socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Be careful not to let the tissue warm too much (which can cause it to shrink or, in more serious cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more efficient against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is enough; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of the filters varies, and if you are in doubt, it might be good to consider buying gallons of water from a trusted company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests with which they are unfamiliar in the regions from which they came.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, generally do not qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy tax-free goods and fees in certain locations.
Travelers visiting high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often go through isolated serpentine areas.
If you do not have the custom of driving on inland roads, be mindful: steep slopes, narrow slopes and sharp curves are common.
The announced speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections — commonly 55-65 km/h — and strict obedience to them is even more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as, for example, in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good and, in Bavaria, they are very capricious and varied, similar to those of the southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit sweets are recurrent, with apples baked in sweets all year round, and cherries and plums marking presence during the summer.
Many German bakery goods also have almonds, hazelnuts and other chestnuts. Famous cakes often match very well with a cup of very strong coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, can be called Berliner, Ppannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be “dry” or “wet” depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a range that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But if used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available across the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of simplely seasoned dishes, the predominant Javanese spices being peanuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
For a knight's feet to have support, stirrups are used, which are hanging on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the knight, but may present safety problems as the knight's feet may be trapped in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one of his feet gripped on the stirrup, he can be dragged in case the animal ends up running away. To reduce this danger, several safety preventions can be taken
First, a large part of the pilots wear riding boots with jump and smooth sole, which is quite narrow.
Then some saddles, mainly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall from the saddle if pulled back by a falling knight.
As the main climbing destination in Chile, the Cochamo Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
The meetings include exciting views of the peaks. Mountaineers from all parts of the world are continually setting new routes from their infinite potential of walls.
Snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding through snow-covered terrains with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important activity on the trip for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacation just to ski in a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers, dating back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport refers to the 17th century at least and, in the year 1861, the first recreational ski team was opened by citizens of Norway in Australia.
Ski backpacking: activity also known as serton skiing, hiking skiing or mountaineering.
It is related, but usually does not involve tourism for alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latest made on steep terrain and demanding skis and much more rigid boots.
Think of the ski route as a walking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover distances slightly larger than on foot — but very rarely you will get the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared runways.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to pass through visa applications and passport control several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a country in this respect.
If you stay in that area, it is possible to cross the border without passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition specifying which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define items over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar products produced in bulk.
Reindeer breeding is an important means of subsistence among Sami, and the culture around trade is also important for many other classes of professionals.
As much as a tradition, not all Sami have participated in the breeding of reindeer on a large scale, but lived from fishing, hunting and the like, having reindeer as, mainly, traction animals.
Today, many Sami work with modern business. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romans, the term "cigan" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Roma people.
If the country you will visit is subject to travel guidelines, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
It is also recommended that you consult governments other than yours, but their advice is given to their respective citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may go through situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Councils are only a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The views presented are usually superficial, general and simplified in relation to the most detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the generic term for any dangerous climate phenomenon with the potential to cause harm, serious social disturbance or loss of human lives.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and encompasses different types, which vary according to geographic location, topography and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of a rigorous climate, as well as storms, tornadoes, watertrombs and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather phenomena include snowfall, snow, ice and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather in their area as this can affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, the person should first receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for 'Hostil Environment Course' will typically indicate the address of a company in the region.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves dramatization, several first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the jungle are common, but publications about war zones are rare.
Travelers planning a gender change surgery abroad must ensure they are carrying valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with undefined gender (X), or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is widely variable.
Searches at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone gender exchange surgery should not expect to go through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
Return currents are the reflux of water from the waves on the beach returning to the sea, usually in a reef or similar area.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and can form a rapid stream to deep waters there.
Most deaths are due to fatigue by trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the chain, swimming back is not harder than it would normally be.
Try to target from somewhere where you can’t be caught or, depending on your abilities or if you’ve been detected, wait for ransom.
The re-entry shock occurs before the cultural shock (ocurs less honeymoon time), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to the new culture sometimes have a special difficulty in adjusting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of the habits of your local culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People don’t imagine that patience and understanding are also fundamental for travelers coming home.
In the area reserved for children, one of the most interesting things is the show of pyramid lights and sounds.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a story book.
The Sphinx is defined as the backdrop and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed in the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in the year 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active until the year 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, where is located the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
The rest are Livingston Island and Deception, in which the boiler flooded by a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbour.
The Land of Ellsworth is the southern region of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula mountains here merge on the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360-kilometre chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut off by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, reaching 4,892m on Mount Vinson.
In remote locations, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be your only option.
A satellite phone usually does not replace a cell phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors overlooking the satellite.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone operator may provide more information about the connection to that service.
An increasingly popular option for those who intend to have a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who leave school, allowing them to take a year before college, without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a sabbatical year can in fact increase your chances of entering higher education in your home country.
Normally, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
For those who love boat rides, Finland is a great destination. On the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the "Land of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don’t necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are really large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a differentiated experience.
Sailing with a boat is a national hobby in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but a fairly characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is from one to forty).
Most of the Baltic cruises offer extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for two whole days and return to the ship to sleep at night.
If you only embark on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if these people haven’t travelled by plane before or have never gone through a traumatic event.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s no different from personal fears and antipathies for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear that is based on unknown or not being in control.
Carrier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is very important in sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they have shipped things by air freight, depending on the route, it may take days to arrive at landing and pass through customs.
The only way to pass faster was to ship as checked luggage. The airline regulations do not allow them to ship luggage without a passenger, which is where you enter.
The obvious way to fly in the first class or executive class is to spend a lot of money for the privilege (or, better yet, making your company do this for you).
However, it’s not cheap: as basic rules, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economic rate for the executive class and eleven times more for the first class!
In general terms, it is not worth even looking for seat discounts for executive class or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The language of the country is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Izmir, it is now a modern, developed and bustling shopping center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-facaded buildings and modern shopping centers are marked by traditional red roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that reminds more Mediterranean Europe than classical Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighboring island Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the church adro, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on people's tombs.
It is worth walking half an hour through the intriguing village.
To the north, and easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after a lush account of its splendors made by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 Bus travels to Sintra frequently with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (Relicary), a place famous worldwide for Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are basically visiting a huge cemetery, also as a place that has virtually incalculable meaning for a significant portion of the world’s population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their period here and many others both Jews and non-Jews, whose loved ones were murdered or worked there to death.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not damage the place by staining or cracking the buildings with pitches.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, much of them understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish
However, most of the plates are only in Catalan, because this is the language that was established by law as an official language.
Still, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular subway ads are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inappropriate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still good behaviour, acting as someone who is "well-high" (well-educated). This will make the journey considerably easier.
The sudden outside of the Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic courtesies
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is highly wooded, mainly with beech, fir, and pine trees, and features a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to varying microclimates, different soils and different altitude levels.
The area also houses a wide variety of species of animals and birds.
Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats and tetraces, as well as various other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, women are forced to wear skirts covering their knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide costumes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring their own costumes, especially with bright colors, you will be welcomed with a smile from the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants covering their knees.
It is possible to borrow clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable to wear these skirts. For men, there is a unique size!
Majorcan cuisine, as well as similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil at all.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any ingredients available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie for you, always begin with capital letters, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, without a doubt, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to figure out if a verb or adjective is used in a substantive way.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they were written.
The main letters to be observed are C and G, as their pronunciation varies according to the vowel below.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: expensive means dear, while car means car.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mainly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar card will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
It is also not necessary to say that if you have knowledge of a Romanesque language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish can conclude precipitately that Portuguese is similar enough to the point that it is not necessary to study separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not a problem, they usually find themselves in cities or campuses of universities, easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas that exhibit favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observation of cherry flowers, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where the blooming of the plum was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom feasts were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "only one" mud.
If you are going to visit a formally arranged garden, collecting "samples" will also cause you to be expelled, without the right to discussion.
Singapore is usually an extremely safe and very easy to explore place, and you can buy almost everything after arriving.
But being in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of Ecuador, you will need to deal with the heat (constant) as with the strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses going north to Hebron, the traditional cemetery of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check if the bus you intend to take goes to Hebron, not just to the village near Kiryat Arba.
Indoor water courses can be a good theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley, the Upper Middle Rhine Valley or take a boat ride to the Danube’s interesting points or sail the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday traditions have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake somewhere open to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The most traditional churches usually hold a Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations often break the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here swimming, flying or boating.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, which made the giant turtle the main grassy animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans on Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you are visiting the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the aurora boreal, as the sky becomes dark more or less at the right time.
Since the areas are poorly inhabited, and consequently light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to appreciate the stars.
In Japan, cultural labour relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are accustomed to see.
Suits are the standard suit in business, and coworkers call each other by their surnames or positions.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than highlighting individual achievements.
Workers generally need the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without questioning.
