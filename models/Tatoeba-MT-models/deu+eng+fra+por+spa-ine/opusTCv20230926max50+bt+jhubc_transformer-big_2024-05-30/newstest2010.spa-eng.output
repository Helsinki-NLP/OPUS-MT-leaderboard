Barack Obama will be the fourth US President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and $1.4 million check will receive them, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening global diplomacy and cooperation between nations.
The White House chief and his wife Michelle will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he will for the first time meet the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple is scheduled to meet with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth president to receive it, although the third to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased further with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, the diploma and the check of ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
It is proposed to donate charitable parafines, but has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During their full program, the President and his wife will attend a banquet, in addition to the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama had a rather reserved attitude toward the award from the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not deserved it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned it represents "a challenge to take action."
Nature defender accused of blackmail
Litoměřice police accused the president of the civic association Společnost ochránců přírody Litoměřice (Society of Nature Defenders Litoměřice) of blackmailing.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded investors money for their own benefit, Litoměřice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Society of Nature Defenders Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently detained and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn’t like containers too much to separate garbage
In Prague, citizens can separate drink packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
What about Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I don’t want to say that in Brno the garbage is not split at all.
It seems to me that, to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally late in the garbage separation, not only because we, the citizens, can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a bottle of PET in the center to the right container?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské náměstí square, opposite the Potrefená Huse.
Let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues not be mad at me, but that seems too little to me.
There is no need to mention that it is not easy to separate garbage elsewhere either.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
By vagancy
What happens is that the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw out several glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going on the tram I found the right place.
The garbage was already overflowing with the container.
It remains the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extra league, which embarrass us throughout the republic, and not buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after surfing the Internet a little bit, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst of the entire Jihomoravský kraj region.
"Paroubek" budget removed money from incomes and sickness allowances
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, add funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness subsidies, or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt all governments in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for some groups, they relyed on the government to subsequently request a loan for sensitive expenses, incomes or sickness subsidies. "That means only postponing problems for the future, it is placing mines," says Janota.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest and, one day, you have to return the money.
The state doesn’t have many options to get money.
If you do not reduce the state’s social benefits or operating expenses, you have to increase the taxes.
To all whom the left added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, his children too.
People don't have to worry about incomes or sickness subsidies, they will receive them. Of these accounts, 1.8 billion disappeared.
But the price to be paid will be the rise in public debt; next year will not be missing in the treasury only 163 billion, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s effort, debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come with slightly increasing VAT or reducing maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the dislocation of money for the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be a lack of five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors in which the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their price cannot be reduced.
The most you can do is keep them, which is not free either.
That means delay or halt of the thirty large constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, warns Transportation Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
ČSSD proposed a Solomon solution for the decrease of funds: it will get money from the dividends of ČEZ, which is mostly state-owned, and will add the transportation fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year, ČEZ allocated 18 billion dollars to the budget.
Each year the dividends are settled ecological damages, serve to complete the account for the rents or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the rents.
In addition, with this trick, according to EU rules, the real budget deficit increases to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers does not end here.
Nearly three billion dollars were obtained from the budget to award various compensation to victims of communism and crimes, or for litigation expenses, including construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay it, Janota says.
Then, the Minister will have to save money within the spring or, in the worst case, take hand of the government budget reserve.
There is also a hundred million lacking for the Statní pokladna (State Cash) project, which is priced at two billion and has already been initiated. It must allow online monitoring what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage begins in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will arrive, Janota warns.
Your future smartphone will be able to operate on two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone on which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
Just pressing a key, they go from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This possibility is the aim of the U.S. company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualizer software for computers.
On your mobile you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, VMware’s Srinivas Krishnamurti said in the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and several days ago it was shown for the first time.
It will be released in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully shown journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the aforementioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is at its peak.
VMware cooperates with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
Not only the ski operators in Krkonoše are concerned about the snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That’s why you can still get free rooms in Krkonoše for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the deals, check the prices, but they’re still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether there will be snow or mud this Christmas," said the owner of the news portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend New Year's Eve at Špindlerův Mlýn according to their expectations, should not hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation in second place can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of Špindlerův Mlýn mostly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but they will soon yield and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
What we are most interested in now is the Christmas Week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered remain free.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-minute Christmas stays,” said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer vacancies.
They sell very well also on the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year's interest in winter stays is affected by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes remain snowy during the week, Christmas dates will be exhausted as well," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Horizont hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was harder.
We are about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas, we have the last free places.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays are already busy at the Omnia Hotel, near the central parking lot in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel in Janské Lázně at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we find ourselves roughly sixty percent of the occupation capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkonoše will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, director of the Omnia hotel.
At the moment, however, it seems that the hoteliers in Krkonoše will have snow cravings waiting.
On Thursday temperatures should drop and, if there is rainfall, in the mountains it should snow.
But then temperatures will rise again, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic.
U.S.: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan issue the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the foolishest.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only does the same text use the phrase “like in Iraq” several times, but it also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 statement for his own statement: “A New Way Forward.”
It was he himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from civil war, and that criticized him as “an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, demonstrated that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so that today there is nothing talking about Iraq in the news.
Bush’s reputation did not improve, yet objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to be repeated.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the indecisive gunmen in the White House to harsh criticism.
He asked for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn’t think of anything better, so at least he deceived the general over 10,000 soldiers.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be its goal, starting to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finishing this procedure in three years.
Many doubt that the increase will yield the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: it is not possible to trust anyone and no agreement is fulfilled.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, if they are used to changing the boss every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, though formally established, will remain only a people of Potemkin, after which patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to the confusing relationships, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is “capable of action,” a minimum goal of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy collides with his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to worsen and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war for "coming home soon," will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of the troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect declaration of the American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans have less and less willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and increased sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem with military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek the answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential election and that is why there is still a lot of time left to find another strategy, if it is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs bank managers will not receive cash bonuses again
Senior executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn in the event that they have taken excessive risks.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to link the bonuses on Wall Street with the long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longest path it must take, said former JPMorgan banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs faced criticism after spending nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) on bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to Reuters agency, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $20 billion.
The high bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a sensitive issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to tax at once, with a fifty percent tax, bonuses for bankers exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year women received the Nobel Prize in all categories except Physics
Five women, which is a record figure, received this year’s Nobel Prizes in specialised categories and in literature from King Charles XVI Gustavo of Sweden today in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, the winner was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded by two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was received by Israeli Ada Jonath and the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for the explanation of the structure and function of the ribosomes.
The latest award, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was received by American Elinor Ostrom and his countryman Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without a woman awarded, was Physics.
This award was received today by scientists Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which constitutes the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each winner collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This amount in each category is up to ten million Swedish krones (approximately 25 million Czech krones).
If there are several award winners in each category, the prize will be shared with each other.
The most traditionally awaited Nobel Prize, Peace Prize, received him this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by U.S. President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, since he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country participating in two wars: in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, however, he added that in certain situations wars are essential for achieving peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved Wednesday by the House of Deputies.
The budget, and perhaps Janota’s stay in the cabinet, are supposed to be the topics of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by President Radim Ochvat’s spokesman.
On his stay in office, Janota wants to negotiate with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The House of Deputies, however, on Wednesday approved the left’s proposals for fund transfers and increased money for official salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government disagrees with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
There was a serious internal policy conflict between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other. Because of this conflict, the future activities of Fischer’s bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in the spring by the SDG, ČSSD and the Party of the Greens, begin to be controversial.
Critics claim that the budget, in the version approved by the House of Deputies, de facto liquidates the package of saving measures imposed in the autumn by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus may but does not have to sign the state budget law; he said during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected "the serious problem," that is, "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finance.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president says.
SDG leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is frightening and that the government should think of its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words "strong sentences."
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is horrific, prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government.
On Wednesday, ČSSD said the adoption of the state budget for next year was successful.
The populars were also happy.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, played by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say the protagonist roles are played by American actors.
History talks about sport, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and his first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by an Oscar-winning American actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said 91-year-old Mandela asked him to play him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I will have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a real story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation is still racially and economically divided.
He believes he is able to unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong to the outsiders globally.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela’s story to the cinemas.
“I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as similar to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I discovered that by squeezing his hand, I receive his energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players predominated.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met with Pienaar at his house for the first time.
I remember knocking at the door, he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look much louder."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and ambitions for the Oscar are also spoken.
Daily Variety magazine film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendour about Norway solved: Russians tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The "Bulava" type missile, previously intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Not even its repeated presence in missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly out or an air failure occurred.
In Russian newspapers they write "Bulová" as "a missile that doesn't fly."
A missile that doesn't fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were technical problems in the aircraft again.
The engine probably broke out in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Buláva" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile enables launch from a vessel that is moving and submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Buláva".
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the very beginning that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by claiming that one cannot speak simply of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the crash occurred in the third.
In the previous cases the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Although none of the launches passed completely error-free, according to the Defense Ministry management, only six of the thirteen were failed.
The success of nearly fifty percent fills with optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to claim that "Buláva" one day will fly smoothly and that it will even be able to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose maximum total weight is 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with Moscow CSKA at 51
Legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will be presenting himself again at age 51 for a professional hockey match.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov finished his career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash is injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov constantly practices and is committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is still unclear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to raise the mood of the other players, Nemchinov mentioned.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice tracks, he will become the oldest professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played for Hartford in the NHL at the age of fifty-one throughout the season, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The biggest of the group of the five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Glory Hall.
Hyundai fulfilled the requirements of the unions. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the car factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions declared the emergency by strike on Monday.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants for this year to agree with the unions an additional Saturday shift.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential, so we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will be worked in two shifts, Vaněk said.
According to the server Sedmička.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working on Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for Saturday, November 28.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change the way it motivated its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can charge the bonus for overtime or can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend the holidays by one day, Vaněk mentioned.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive money for the trip and for food.
Because the additional work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, which stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all the additional work for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Car factory employees were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted virtually every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and trade unionists should be held on Monday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they commit to comply with the requirements and the document is signed, they are willing to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week, when approximately 400 employees spontaneously went on strike over frequent additional jobs.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management said employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
Trade unionists in their Monday strike emergency statement also demanded that none of the employees, who interrupted manufacturing on Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
With regard to additional work, trade unions demand that the company minimizes it.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The Nošovice Hyundai car factory currently has 2,000 employees.
Mass production began last November.
Until last September, it manufactured approximately 80,000 cars; its current productive potential is 200,000 cars per year.
A Czech Discovery: An Effective Substance Even in the 'Colded' HIV Virus
Team of Czech and German scientists test new compounds capable of moderating HIV spread in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus, as some medicines already available.
AIDS can’t be cured until now.
However, patients’ lives may be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent HIV virus replication in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, the so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, the medications no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and Heidelberg University demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They showed that substances called metallocarborans have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metallocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all drugs used today, and that is why they can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared to know the molecular mechanism of their bond to the albumin of the virus.
The metallocarborans have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedral cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are bonded by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the virus’ life cycle.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation does not occur and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be modified systematically.
A little weaker, but more effective
The test of the effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was performed on a probe, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from HIV patients.
The effect of metallocarborans on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes metallocarborans interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína <0xC5><0x98>ezáčová, head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Genetics.
Fight for budget. SDG attacked Fischer, he defends himself
SDG chief Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is "scareful" and Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should, according to him, think of its future existence.
The SDG statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong judgments.
They say time is left for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Nečas said the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he wants to rely on the minority in the House of Deputies, which is trying to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in his position with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy toward the public deficit problem is completely different, Nečas warned.
The House of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010, however, with amending proposals by the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Deputies increased money for state officials’ salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the SDG proposals as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
SDG before the vote left the hall and thus fulfilled the government’s wish that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and sense of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reappreciate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota would seriously threaten with resignation in the event of the adoption of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota asked for a meeting with the prime minister.
He pointed out that he is thinking of staying in the role.
The reason is their disappointment in the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Nečas in the government they have nothing to do with the nominees for the ČSSD, which imposed the budget changes.
The Prime Minister should also clearly state whether he will resign if the House approves other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to sickness subsidies, incomes, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated for SDG are not to blame
This is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the SDG have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in U.S. text news.
He recalled, that in several ministries in lieutenant posts there are people belonging to the TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas emphasized that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of struggle with the height of the public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it rests on the leftist majority, which is currently in the chamber of deputies."
However, it will not be able to rely on the support and tolerance of SDG members.
I haven’t thought about that, when the time comes, I’ll take care of it,” Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by members of the SDG, told reporters in the chamber of deputies.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS ceded at the Prime Minister’s request
Nečas stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the House of Deputies would likely vote against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister does not explicitly ask ODS deputies to allow acceptance of the budget.
We don’t feel like orphans, we’re not young children, he responded to the question, whether SDG doesn’t care about the party leader’s absence in parliament and the Czech Republic during budget negotiations.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned, he knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the Bolshevism of the House of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive, and Topolánek himself reacted.
According to ČD’s new train schedule, fewer trains will be running for nearly the same rates
České dráhy (Czech Railways) will cancel or restrict some less used fast and local trains from December 13 and, on the contrary, reinforce some links.
The total traffic extension will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into effect.
Most rates including the base and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of links to the capital will earn, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostravsko region, drahy for this line will add a pendolino carriage.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not return to Bratislava.
On the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line fewer fast trains will travel, the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction in transport planned by drahy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and surroundings.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice trail and some quick trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days of the week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance connections to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádraží station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
As of December 13, travellers will not travel again to Bratislava in Pendolino.
This year’s regional railway account: 200 million more than before
Rapid trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Drahy will receive four billion crowns in total next year, just like this year. Local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the state will help them nearly three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For fast and local dráhy trains have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract was always one-year.
Drahy are happy with the system, and perhaps that’s why they didn’t raise the prices of a large majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur on one-day tickets - ČD Net and on cheap internet tickets eLiška.
For travelers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will rise from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiska will depend on the distance, so far there was the single price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine armed forces continue to detain more than 50 people, children released
Armed people have abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was said by the AFP agency, which previously reported only about 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children detained and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping occurred in the southern Agusan province.
Approximately 19 armed men use the hostages as a living shield in the escape from police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree on the delivery of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the armed belong to the New Popular Armada (NPA), an armed fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, police previously pursued the kidnappers due to violence, the cause of which was the adjustment of accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was because of the recent slaughter, in which 57 people died, martial law imposed.
Among the victims of the November 23 slaughter, related to the governor’s elections, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre they arrested the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on the island of Mindanao.
However, they renewed peace dialogues with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
RSA’s story refers to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film, by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), will be released in the U.S. cinemas, which captures a part of the biography of former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the lead role.
The second role, that of the legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Its full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sacharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, along with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994-1999.
The media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the protagonist roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared well to play it.
Many times I found myself in person with Nelson Mandela, to – as it is said – collect his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the movie we can remember Mandela’s character and message.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, butit refers to everyone, he added.
In the suit of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book of British writer John Carlin with the freely translated title In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game the nation was born. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential period.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also wears the costume of the South African national rugby team and enters the playing field. RSA won the World Cup at that time.
By entering the grass in the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The soccer championship may be able to help people come together and form a nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, the only “black” on the national team in 1995.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as he said in an interview for LN, for example, a rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled his country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer worth tens of millions of crowns
The fire grabbed in the morning a transformer from the Čeps company in a switch box near the Vyškov village in Lounsko.
According to Lukáš Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the Ústí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously firefighters wanted to let the transformer be destroyed by fire, but later they changed their mind and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandátová, the company spokeswoman, the breakdown does not jeopardize the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, listing it exactly will not be possible before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátová, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of Čeps's activity nothing similar happened, the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman of the ČEZ company for Northern Czechia, electricity supplies were not cut, and the fire of the electrical substation did not affect the operation of households, offices or businesses.
A.s. Čeps působí in the territory of the Czech Republic as exclusive operator of the distribution system, of the electrical driving of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical power from the transmission system to the distributor system, in addition to maintaining the electrical driving of 4339 kilometers long.
Jančura to file complaint for slander to three hetmans of ČSSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura today will file a complaint for slander to three social-democratic hetmans.
This is Michal Hašek of the Jihomoravský kraj region, Radko Martínek of Pardubický kraj and Olomoucký kraj hetman Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned it in Twenty minutes on Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with České drahy.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the roses from the cake", yet we brought only the offer for what they wanted themselves.
They say, that we are more expensive than České drahy, which is not true. We know the prices of České drahy, which were set last week.
So there is nothing left but to defend ourselves.
It is for the slander towards the Student Agency society, he told Radiožurnál Jančura.
He also mentioned having evidence from all regions, and he said they have not taken necessary measures in harmony with European law.
That is why it is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this complaint to be the continuation of Mr. Jančura’s medial show, which serves as a free advertising for his company and for himself.
Of course I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and I appeal to other Hetmans to do so too.
I guess, which will also be clearly demonstrated on this occasion, that Mr Jančura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses liar and false arguments, Hašek mentioned.
Jančura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
Radiožurnál told him that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after New Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jančura began the campaign after the regions agreed with České drahy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion crowns did not convene a tender.
According to Jančura similar steps are at odds with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a member of the ČSSD because of his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was that if we don’t leave it, we can lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know, what man he is about, I am not going to say his name, Jančura said today for Radiožurnál.
Pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine starting in January will put an end to usual customs.
As the first vaccine it should be free for families and at the same time volunteer.
However, there are already opinions that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcus vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicines is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
As of January, children born since August 2, last year can receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started the vaccine last year or earlier, have to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of a child.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to let their children vaccinate against pneumococcus.
Parents, however, paid for a dose of 1600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Experts generally estimate that insurance companies will spend 300 to 450,000 crowns on vaccines annually.
Uncluttered will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 children’s vaccination annually.
The covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Pneumococcal infections in our country die each year, according to research in hospitals, 28 children not older than 10 years of age.
In addition to Czechia, the pneumococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
However, opinions appear at the same time, that this vaccine could be mandatory in the future.
As of January it must be covered by insurance and voluntary companies.
The compulsory vaccine would be better, noted for example Rudolf Kalovský, head of the civic association Nahlas.
Their association has spread pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
Experts at an international conference, in which our partnership participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not completely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovský mentioned.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
At this point we are not thinking about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say
The president of the pediatric society Odborná společnost praktický dítský lékařů Hana Cabrnochová acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
"In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have initiated the vaccination as voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts hope that by next year more than 80 percent of young parents will let their babies vaccinate against pneumococcus.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a major change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save on treatment, Cabrnochová explains.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be bought by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just like when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some deputies, however, were afraid that insurance companies could "take out the money from health insurance."
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in vaccines 40,000 a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta father, 81, is famous for his representation of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press news agency reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
The agency reported that Frazatta, a 52-year-old son, told police that his father had ordered him "to enter the museum by any means to move all the paintings to a depot."
The agency said that Frazetta father denied having granted such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have advocated tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, facing criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling "washed" an opportunity to show his seriousness about the deficit cut, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Security spending and a 1% ceiling in public sector wage agreements from 2011 onwards.
Cholera for Social Security
Trade unions have complained that low-wage workers are punished by a recession generated by others, and have warned of future “problems.”
The rise in Social Security spending, which will grow by about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year, has angry the business community, which claims that this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those who earn more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, starting from April 2011
The economy will shrink more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers’ bonds
1-point corporate tax increase for small firms was ruled out
Tax exemptions for electric cars and wind turbines
State pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal to halve the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the highest wages.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that tax increases and outlined spending cuts were a “grain of sand in the desert” compared to what was needed.
“These are big figures that will allow us to halve the deficit, which is absolutely essential for the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he had confidence that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party’s forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit is reduced, have been questioned after the Minister of Finance was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely shrink by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while the loan request would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion above the previously estimated.
"Wasted Opportunity"
The Conservatives, which will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning about the Labour Party’s “debt crisis,” said the projection of <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application for the next six years was unsustainable.
The ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, “cynically” avoiding difficult choices until after the elections to be held in June 2010.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
“All major announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek further short-term deficit reduction.
But Democratic liberals claimed that the money raised from tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sand castles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the time chosen for the announcements, such as rising inflation from some of the above-mentioned disability subsidies next April, would leave the Finance Minister exposed to charges of electoral manoeuvres, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that people are being provided the most needed and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"False Budget"
Although ministers did not publish the post-2011 spending data, economists said it was clear that the adjustment of public spending would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said the figures from the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“This is really postponing the pain for later,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All major announcements will come after the election, who wins,” added Roger Bootle, economic consultant for Deloitte’s accountants.
"This has been the fake report before the budget. Markets realize this."
FBI inquires about "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were detained in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia, U.S., last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also looking for information about men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian inheritance and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they are U.S. citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are being held back,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who were missing,” the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house that belongs to one of them's uncle.
He said the house was already in the sight of the local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency said, but said the U.S. had to “work closer with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students’ families reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iranian “abuses”
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the models of abuse" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened to rape him.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticism has a political foundation.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens murdered in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s election sparked the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been convicted, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran, Jon Leyne, now in London, says during the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, as saying he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the outcome of the election.
"They often hit me in the face," according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said after five days she signed a false confession and released him and left him on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, while others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied allegations of rape, but admitted that there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed that he was held in a container along with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention facility in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the discomfort of the postselection and the government’s response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were confused and the parliamentary committee’s investigations had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the last three weeks, to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a competition track.
The Track at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jumping ramp opposite a 100-meter-long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
It sees under a beautiful view of the lights of the city blinking.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the county, true talent.”
The prizes were presented for the best tricks or manoeuvres performed on the track.
After Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be melted.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have asked for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is a widespread alert to the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (which are actually integrating) into one of the continent’s most openly secular societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as fans of the author's latest work "Why the French don't like veils" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and media are saying about Islam in France, but what is actually happening.
It has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide the 5-6 million Muslims in France what Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces."
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions that interest them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should they teach young Muslims about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, things of daily life, that worry the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not able to disseminate this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Mr. Bowen interviewed tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of the Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questiones to what extent French political strategists (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are probably treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historical commitments to secular Republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, it perceives “a value adjustment.”
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most devastating landscape in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming speed, taking life with it that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have focused on recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result of this.
In "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and policy of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave proof of courage confronting the white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson as a courageous 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is surely a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, the zoo enclosures are still generally one millionth of the area of a wild adult’s area. The climate is almost never adequate: a polar bear residing in Singapore was greened by the algae that grow within the hairless areas of his fur.

Ellis resorts to stories from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters present to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and snowmobile Eskimo Indians use high-powered assault rifles to knock down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters northward of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a stunning look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It's not because of lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries gave insights for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines traced a map of the moving ice cords that circulate beneath the ice masses.
Satellite explorations and extensive series of probes mounted on icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by salt jets that compress as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders in the interior, they are all condemned once the summer ice withdraws, what is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 placing crowns in Arlington's graves
De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where they are embarking us, these could be us, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If it were us, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I just try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns on the tombs of veterans in various sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown Company in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year stoping in different cities along the way, to host events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year the volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, New York City Battery Park, and United Airlines Flight 93 commemorative site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and carry crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a career military deceased.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was her way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the wide meadows and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers headed to older tombs of World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War, because they don’t receive as many visits as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands, while carrying the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red bow tied at the top.
Nearby, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraqi and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark atmosphere of current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the ice air.
Some read loudly names carved on the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone to remember it."
Cuban officials arrest US government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on Dec. 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything that is considered "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an emerging blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has on several occasions requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of an U.S. contractor may likely cause tensions between the Communist administration of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-paced” approach to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to announce the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobiles and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mostly used for text messages, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors to the hotel, and in some government establishment, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are in jail for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly misappropriated.
An activity that would be legal in any other open society, such as distributing free mobiles in Cuba, is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program for the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Nuevo Castro, itself Cuba", a reference to Raúl Castro's position as the country's leader, to replace his sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often detained, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He said any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban government often triggers a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unravel conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who cross the Internet in search of radicalized young people.
Investigators said they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been informed of the case, said Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Consequently, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of an undercover operation.
For this reason they were rejected, the official said, who spoke from anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men were not immutated and were even trying to get adequate approval to access al Qaeda camps when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who are trusted.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has put as a top priority attempting to infiltrate people within al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting pass those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said that al Qaeda looks at aspiring American recruits with special attention.
But for the organization they represent an enormous appeal, due to their potential for access to U.S. targets and due to their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst for the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years than admittors, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts on their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than following the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand "action" climate
On Saturday tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center bolder actions for climate.
Protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little happened in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English that said “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish that declared, “the Earth says “yet enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country has to deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the world’s leaders to present a just, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to avoid it any longer.
Police prevented the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because of wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, such activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black outfits placed several explosives near Copenhagen’s main channel, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started like flares, but that were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "I was really not aware of the situation."
Then he continued to say in Mandarin, "Because the meeting place is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on each’s perspective to determine whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the attention of the general public and different sectors to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that it affects negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Test data reveals persistent racial differences
Last week’s federal gradebook on mathematics performance was very good news for public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best-performing systems, the gradebook showed that fourth and eighth grade students have moved at a faster pace over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains recorded in the recent figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent performance difference between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of D.C. fourth grade white students over the past two years increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African American peers increased only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of eighth-grade African Americans remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average scores of the whites were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Over a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade students in 2003, when the first ENPE was announced in the District, was 60 points of the scale (262 to 202).
Although scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as the advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were driven largely by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we’ve improved the whole by serving those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit organization advocating educational equity in the District.
I am not leaping joy for a two- or three-point difference, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth grade of the Elemental Eaton.
Brown, a regular critic of Rhee’s management style, said the test score message is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly they always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But what worries is that we are not spending the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue finding better ways to address the needs of low-performance students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at primary and middle school students who did not master early reading foundations in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a mathematics curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, emphasizing games and real-life experiences, was introduced to the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who was credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to continue working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below the degree level, Rhee said.
Others say ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase overall system performance while still providing additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to decrease the difference.
Here’s a kind of scary dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California in Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to allocate its resources and administration reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she tries to cling to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children will have access to excellent public education.
Janey, now supervisor of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to get the force of change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers’ union last year in a 185-day year, which he considers to be an “indicator” to seek a further increase in the upcoming agreement.
Make higher education part of more futures
The tourist bus arrived at Gettysburg University with a strong resolve.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12, came down and flashed for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders of the group explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! Here is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
“Oh, seriously,” he thoughtfully said, when the guide spoke of the school’s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already fully absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you are going to go to college.
The question is which one.
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who leave high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education that they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexican and Central American, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest-performing say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it is deduced that any intervention at any time will not solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the tour by Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to run college preparation programs, which begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its fragile infrastructure during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements the Iraqi oil ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in the restoration of Iraq’s oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies left by bidding at just two of the 10 auctioned deposits.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who submitted an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctioned deposits in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will take a long time before something else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the US military withdraws, probably prevented US oil companies from risking more vigorously in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest oil reserve, analysts said.
U.S. companies were in some cases disadvantaged because rivals, in particular Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Leading U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have tightened ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese-owned National Oil Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and achieved large investments in contracts for two major deposits.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said the spokesman for the Assam Jihad Oil Ministry.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be up to date with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
The companies preselected to submit proposals made bids that later confronted the barrel grant that the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each deposit.
Al Qaeda's main planner has been apparently murdered in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile strike on the Pakistani-Afghanistan border is believed to have killed a leading al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles hit his car near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials from the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified aircraft, of the type operated by the CIA within Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car, in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was hit, a Pakistan civil intelligence agency official said, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said local suspected militants rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what was left of the "fully broken bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials quoted unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking military planner of al Qaeda, who led the terrorist group’s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He devoted himself to conspiracy around the world, a senior official said, who spoke from anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guidance from al Qaeda’s superior command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had rapidly climbed in the ranks of al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a known name for some Americans, but that does not diminish in any way the threat posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unpiloted aircraft attacks has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a count of The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is perhaps due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly murdering suspected informants, the site said.
UN top envoy in Kabul about to resign
U.N. top envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday he would resign in March, ending with a tumultuous mandate that was harmed by allegations of extended corruption in the UN-backed Afghanistan presidential election.
Eide’s departure comes when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal that begins in 18 months will push other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials to collaborate with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the Secretary.
U.N. General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it is better for them to start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and covering evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said Galbraith's allegations, who was fired, "surely harmed the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a high civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also boosted the leadership of the UN to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, lent to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase his confidence that his money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration over the constraints on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that the U.N.’s burdensome recruitment regulations undermined his ability to attract talent.
This is how the UN rules allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That's catastrophic and it can't go on.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose “significant additional sanctions” on Iran for failure to start talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, deprived the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs me is that, if we have learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population as a whole.
He said it would be necessary “a package of incentives and disincentives,” “to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less safe with nuclear weapons,” because “its people will suffer enormously” sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he said he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his reserve of enriched uranium in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such a deal as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have moved away from tempting agreements, in part, experts say, because the Iranian command is divided in relation to the possibility of committing to the United States.
“Frankly, I believe that Iran’s hardening with the international community over some proposals they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that they have not been in terms of meaningful additional sanctions against the Iranians,” Gates said.
President Obama has set the deadline on December 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before rethinking other options, including pursuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations denounced what it called on Thursday "baseless and unfounded accusations" by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, saying it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution."
Gates, who was about to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning, before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq, to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to decrease the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delays in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.S. officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the president of Kurdistan’s Regional Government: “We will preserve their security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them."
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching them about the fact that “Mother Earth is too tired to support more children” and “one baby more means one more grave.”
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aged population of their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instantaneous and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only to a child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously hooked children, misleading only sons, affectionately nicknamed “little emperors”, a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when policy came into effect, according to the Division.
UN demographic, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly cultivated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Family Planning and Municipal Population Commission, said that fertile couples must have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aged population and mitigate a future labour shortage.”
Shanghai is about to be "as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden," he said.
Gradual relief
Drafted in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labour discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have reported abuses in policy imposing.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples have made abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural proportion of male and female.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed further exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they attenuated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost in the evening in the morning, the posters ordering families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be suitable for having a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide pamphlets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very unoverwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural town outside Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples wanting a second child after the campaign launched, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to reach only around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee for the Caolu municipality in Shanghai, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best to their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the insufficient health and life insurance that the government provides them.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view single-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yes, they're robbing us of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples quote psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said he wants a single child because she was too: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, a translation agency owner, explained this in a stronger way.
For parents with two middle-class careers, which reduce the birth rate, it is about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up watching their parents’ struggle during the early days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategic "has to have a curriculum prepared for the best day care centers when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN group outlines plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, so far characterized by challenging stances and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden on their shoulders in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a time-out negotiation, with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to face global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what would be the limit of the global temperature rise that political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what U.N. top climate official Yvo de Bóer described as "the big picture."
It shows profiles for a possible deal, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs over the same period by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also encouraged talks on Friday, pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years, to help poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, the same kind of verbal fireworks that dominated conversations last week was presented on Friday.
U.S. climate envoy Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if not funded by the developed world.
The maneuver indicated that the Obama administration is taking a tougher line with China, with respect to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States is not going to make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei claimed that the U.S. top climate negotiator lacked "common sense," or was "very irresponsible" for saying earlier that week that the U.S. would not economically help China face global overheating.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s leading powers at stake, failure lines have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the world’s twenty-four most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that major powers are discussing who should pay the expenses to limit greenhouse gases, even when vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain the major emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is developing, Ulate said, who also works as a regional climate change counselor for Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated that they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say the talks will at the most produce a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, prepared a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push of small island nations has "posted political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most exceptional issues before heads of government come to a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, descended from the planes and ran into the Bella Center halls, meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, to be able to delineate claims to be arbitrated next week.
The absolute disorder of the meeting (where 13,000 people every day come in and out of the convention center, activists who play guitar present night shows mocking the countries they say are selling, and passing preliminary proposals from hand to hand rather than via mail) poses a challenge.
Intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice President for Global Conservation Policy.
Heavyweights are coming.
The first train at 225 km/h from Britain redefines that feeling on Monday
At 5.13 o’clock on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to point to a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country's first high-speed interurban train will reach 225 km/h, when it passes like a lightning from Ashford, Kent, to St Panrcas Station in London, covering 93 kilometers in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, on board the first Javelin intercity service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
Neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and the shift from planes and cars to railways would reduce domestic coal emissions, as well as alleviate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears about environmental damage, can still curb Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will hand over its report to Lord Adonis on Dec. 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be traced within a five-meter radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be traced within a radius of 25 meters of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set up three options for a broader high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with a branch heading west from the Peninsula to Manchester and Scotland, and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once finished, travel times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stretch, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to the slightly more than an hour today.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support trains 400 m long, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
At least 18 trains could operate every hour on a London-Birmingham line.
This means that a London terminal would be needed capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour.
Considering the capital’s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to suit the high-speed network.
Railway industry experts argue that only St Pancras International or Euston stations offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes the scheme should proceed, but broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made until after a general election.
Even if you start the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
At first, trains would be forced to leave the fast lines on existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change from planes to trains, a benchmark for the railroad revolution.
Taxpayers face mortgage for a Conservative’s <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 orangeal
Alan Duncan, the spokesman for the Conservative Party, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in the house of his electoral district.
The party's prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that deputies lived "of rations," raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framed extension at his second home in Rutland.
They allowed him to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the requests at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said that the requests "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orangeal".
Neighbors described it as “a greenhouse for entertainment.”
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the loan increase during a recent inquiry by the Committee on Standards and Privileges of the House of Commons on his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, following an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal guarantee for a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 of his London property to the house of his electoral district, which he had bought in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was requesting approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month in mortgage interest, until March of last year.
In April, their applications increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase was going to finance the loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75,000.
The BRE standard variable mortgage rate dropped from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, which is now the rate.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan still requested <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 a month in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his job as Chairman of the House's opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying the deputies had to survive "from rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated as a daughter."
He said, “I spend my money in my garden and request a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as a petroleum merchant, was first questioned about his expenses in May, when it turned out he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the salary office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a hole in Mr. Duncan’s lawn as a protest after he revealed that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved both by the salary office and later by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about circumventing and criminalizing or violating rules or anything.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It could not be in any way clearer or simpler.”
Come those who have faith, to see the Brighton Beach Palapa Advent Calendar
Brighton palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for every day of December, using villains as their theme.
The event started on December 1, with guests who could see the last palapa from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, with filled cakes and punch served for free.
The songs chosen so far include Vi Three Boats, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant for Hove, is an unpaid clergyman of the diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He stated, “We want religion to be more relevant to people, in a post-Christian society.”
“Why do we as a Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the palapa Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we are trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested Saturday in demand for an ambitious and binding deal to fight global warming around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested several hundred people.
Some 30,000 people, according to police; hundreds of thousands, according to organizers, marched through the icy Danish capital in demand for an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would come into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish climate conference president, the growing global climate mobilization, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to making "the political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents broke out shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with pavements and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened quickly and firmly.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, they are especially members of the "Black Blocks", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinction," stressing that a hundred of them "were immobilized on the street on Saturday night, handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold."
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left parliament and took to the Bella Center, home of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped approximately 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle watch.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present as did some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with sky rainbows, responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: there is time, Benin singer Angélique Kidjo said.
In Africa, there are drying rivers, rivers where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the struggle for another world."
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, initially kicked the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people went out on the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dressed in red and wearing scarves with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, hundreds of protesters were formed who claimed to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people were concentrated.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces “fraud”
On Saturday, Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces “fraud.”
Approximately 131,000 people were summoned to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazia Electoral Commission, the participation was 58 percent just hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night to Sunday.
The five candidates in career, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved the vote scrutiny.
These elections are a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili “shall regret that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation,” his spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladzeh said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After her separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that she is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage of our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, told AFP, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The theme of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes on the banks of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: “We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate the support of Moscow, and very particularly, the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope your country will be quickly recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexey Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his glass of vodka.
The opposition represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two entrepreneurs, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, such as the one that cedes control of Abkhazi railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues he does not support the current power or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus a vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: protests in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people went out to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding agreement to the Copenhagen climate change conference, where police, on alert, arrested more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some 30,000 people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, marched in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left parliament and took to the Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped approximately 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, led a candle watch.
A few moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them down.
Police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a adoquin, and four cars were burned near a busy house during the incidents that led to about twenty people being arrested, police said.
We did not take the eyes off the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters were flying over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam, and even Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as did some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them with sky rainbows, responded by forming a first morning concentration in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form “blue tides” for “justice and climate.”
Today we take the streets to ask for compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

France’s anti-globalization figure, MEP José Bové, told AFP he came to Copenhagen to “unite climate justice and social justice”: “Today’s fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world.”
The Oxfam organization along with former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands highly vulnerable to warming, initially kicked the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people went out on the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, demonstrated dressed in red and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the Philippine City Council.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters were formed who claimed to act against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered hundreds of people, especially in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).

The subject of history and geography comes reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
National Minister of Education, Luc Chatel, said in an interview that will be broadcast in Sunday's Journal (JDD) that history and geography would emerge "strengthened" from the reform of general secondary education, despite being eliminated from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachelor's degree.
From now on, all students of the first bachelor’s degree will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the Minister, "enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the C branch is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students."
The General and Literary Teaching branches cannot be subbranches of the C, he continues even stressing: "I have not heard that historians or intellectuals were outraged for having eliminated history and second-graduate geography in technological schools."
An IFOP poll published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven French out of ten (69%) disapproved the government project to eliminate compulsory history-geography secondary school teaching C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some right-wing elected representatives also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "it is not talked about" eliminating philosophy from the second graduate program C.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will perform an admission test that will aim for their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will also practice in real conditions during the year of M2, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as intern teachers.
If you do all the practice proposals before the contest, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister notes that he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the plan to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Higher Normal School, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of climate.
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge he accepted on Saturday morning Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (IPCC) invited by the Ulm street Higher Normal School.
Jean Jouzel, also a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the Ernest conference wheel, a day composed of a series of 15-minute presentations by experts, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist said.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and convey them a desire to know more, explained Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this day called as the students baptized the fish in the pond of the school.
We chose about twenty participants from among the experts of their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, “we can talk hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes, but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific role, he stressed hoping that the public will understand that “the Copenhagen conference is based on a very serious scientific record.”
Videos filmed during those lectures will be online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly rate.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, action is planned
Prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the holidays, premiums and overtime, which was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
The Penitentiary Workers Force (2nd guard union) asked out-of-service personnel to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of prisons and "block" them to report the theft of their assets.
The CGT Penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls them to "gather in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a mass mobilization", as it describes the failure to pay in December of "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October as "embarrassing and unacceptable".
And the first guard union, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the end of the day, the chancellor reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the guard unions guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice writes in this letter.
I requested the Directorate of the Penitentiary Administration to immediately implement a set of measures to ensure that this situation generated by a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not occur again in the future.
The December pay will then be scarce, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous premiums by functions and objectives, and who "always blames budget demands," the Ufap/Unsa deplored.
It’s a true scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille said outraged, announcing its decision to boycott to new order “all meetings and calls.”
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and relevant holidays if those of October are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, threatens also FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As we are increasing our tasks and missions without taking more staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack staff salary, the prison CGT of Bordeaux estimates.
According to trade unions, not all regions do the same, as some are more lucky than others.
But anyway, the outcome is not as expected, Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget said.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes "better gifts" than he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas at the White House, confessed to famous television presenter Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion as to the gifts: "I make better gifts than I receive."
During a special interview that ABC will broadcast on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they intend to celebrate the holidays at their new prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be from the start.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will "of course" receive a gift, according to the program extracts broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: “No way, last year I made you beautiful gifts,” she said provoking the president.
It is true, he was forced to admit it before he replied humorously pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a distensive atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devoutly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts from childhood.
Barack Obama remembered a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, who he rarely saw, gave him a gift for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For her part, the First Lady remembered her doll house.
I had no idea how to arrange a house, so I put all the furniture in line against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the house, yet I adored that dollhouse, Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL says he's in induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was intervened again in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" derived from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to a coma induced to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old was intervened again Wednesday night to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked "injuries derived from the operation" of disc hernia performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in that same city noted, indicating that such injuries "required a repairing operation."
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility claiming that the situation was "under control," and reported that a new medical party would communicate within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday agreed, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications."
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more certain about their condition, RTL adds.
The press service, questioned by the AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannula would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days ago, was practiced by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux refused to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday entered Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to an infection derived from Delajoux's intervention.
Johnny Hallyday’s close friend, singer Eddy Mitchell, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through “a bad time,” but said there was “no problem” because the rocker is “a fighter.”
He called me just before traveling to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was foolish to get twelve hours of plane after such an operation, it is not possible, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, intended to reassure by stating that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had talked to Laetitia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
But the singer’s health problems have multiplied since July when he was internated for nine days after a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed that he had been operated on a "colon cancer" after a mild infection.
In late September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem is overcome. Fans and journalists noticed the musician's difficulties in moving on the scene.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new internment.
Euro-2009/short pool: first title of Bousquet on his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medallist in the 2009 long pool World Cups, won an international title on Thursday at a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Istanbul.
In the first day of this competition where polyurethane swimwears were last allowed, only three world records were exceeded when in reality many more were expected.
One was enhanced by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A shame for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50m free, a brand he owns in a long swimming pool (20.94).
At one of the two queen distances of swimming, at 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman imposed with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, an international first.
Bousquet advanced Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to reach it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane swimwear that from January 1st will be banned.
These swimsuits, originating from 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the wearing of the swimsuits did not help German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark by 400 m free (3:32.77), however, he defeated with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give myself in this race.
I knew I wouldn’t be able to break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: A panel of sarcophagus belonging to Zola sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, well above the estimated price, Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long and 63 cm high, dates back to the 3rd century AD, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural framework, surrounded by satyrs and drunk women, is an unusual piece, as in the world there are only four or five," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold between a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot has been the most bidding by buyers, undoubtedly, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that the marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, later appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her private Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that conditions were not given to transfer to its territory the overthrown president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the evening with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility to make the transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya, returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General for Migration.
To grant him a safe behaviour, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to “renounce” and seek political asylum abroad.
But the overthrown president refused because he wanted to arrive in Mexico as a guest-in-exercise head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my office (...), they wanted me to submit my resignation," Zelaya told radio Globo on Thursday, in which he usually makes statements since the beginning of the political crisis that has been in the country of Central America for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar, he added playing a few chords the deposed president, a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted an application for safe behaviour, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the coup government’s Interior Minister Oscar Raúl Matute told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview on Telesur, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do it as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president on Wednesday, who gathered around the Brazilian embassy, heavily besieged by the military.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government’s position.
That reflects the marginality of this government against international standards, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, when he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he surprisingly returned on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be detained and must be held to justice for the crime of “high treason,” according to the coup government.
The de facto president, Roberto Micheletti, managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
In the controversial scrutiny, Porfirio Lobo was elected, recognised by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya's return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up Thursday, the U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to both the U.S. and its partners’ economic recovery: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the final figures at the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the Nasdaq, a technological component, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose by 0.58% (6.40 points) reaching 1,102.35 points.
We receive good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "on the half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on U.S. trade balance figures, “reflecting an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big novelty is the growth of trade volumes, in particular goods exports, which reflect the growth of major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States increased unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "was the lowest in a year," said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.482% vs. 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% vs. 4.408% on Tuesday night.
Cuba: More than a hundred supporters of power slaughter the "Ladies of White"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power struck the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty "Ladies of White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro's government as they walked to the center of the capital demanding the release of those detainees, an AFP journalist said.
The Yankees died!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Viva Fidel and Raúl!" the power militants raised their fists to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by agents dressed in civilians who came to "protect them".
On the eve, a similar demonstration unleashed against the "Ladies of White" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were arrested by police officers dressed in civilians, an AFP journalist reported.
The agents forced the vehicles to the dissidents who were stuck by government supporters, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents in similar circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "Ladies of White", awarded the 2005 Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "appeal for the release of all political prisoners", about 200 according to the dissent, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, serves a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities call opponents “mercenaries” or “agents” at the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Very rare in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of government militants against the “contra-revolutionaries”.
Cuba, governed by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
An alien killer killed an eighteen-year-old with a knife and left 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the centre of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts of the Seine) on Thursday at the time of most influx in the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant would have beaten with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, an elderly, in the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses reported.
Following the serious injuries, the man born in 1929 died in the hospital, according to a official of the Alliance police union.
Then at the pharmacy or in front of it, she attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, stopped and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elder died.
The life of the other injured, with the vital organs seemingly affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered fainting and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who seemed to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped through Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
Apparently randomly, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: one thirty-year-old, and another forty-year-old seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
It was armed with two butcher knives that had crossbounds on its back, said Arnaud Pressé, an Alliance union official in the Seine Highs.
Several passers-by, including young people, tried to control the alien, according to testimonies obtained by the AFP.
I saw a guy about thirty years old wearing a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn’t do it because the guy was strong, explained Alberto, a bartender at a nearby bar.
A crowd hit him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
On Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal officers, including the chief, attempted to arrest the armed man and were punched, according to police testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was a man injured on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the floor. When put him in a secure position, I perceived a very serious wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person about 35 years old arrived, with knife wounds.
National police officers arrested the man without identity documents.
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his provisional detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not exclude the possibility of being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, six police officers were needed to control him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
It was "in a state of overexcitation" as "every such disrupted whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
U.S.: Polanski’s lawyer asks again to dismiss the cause
Lawyer for French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), to dismiss the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, for a case of sexual abuse occurring more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director’s attorney for “The Pianist,” reported serious procedural mistakes at the time of the events to three judges of the Second District of California Appeals Chamber in 1977.
Hummel declared: I claim that the charges should be dismissed at the same time, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "were scary."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since then) had talked with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail, before giving a judgment, which constitutes a serious lack of proceedings.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But finally Wells declared in late September "he had lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel claimed the holding of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The indictment, for its part, reiterated the argument presented in the first instance, i.e. that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his sentence was issued for “illegal sexual relationships” with a girl under 13 years of age.
Since then, he has never stepped in the United States again.
Los Angeles District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski "has to be here to present himself at the hearing."
Do we want to convey the message, not only to Roman Polanski, but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of fleeing?
The filmmaker “asks for a favor from the court, even though he despises his authority.”
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed that "there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one who asked to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also complained, once again, to close the case.
She argues that her client no longer supports harassment every time the Polanski case reappears, adding: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years, that’s enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland for an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months after the bars, he was sentenced to home prison in his Gstaad cabin, awaiting an eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses its course and is slowed by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday, in a market that is struggling between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final figures at the closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the Nasdaq, a technological component, lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend continued thanks to the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which “helped to improve the market’s views as to the solidity of the economic recovery,” Charles Schwab analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence recovered visibly in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
Indexes, however, were slowed by a new dollar break that reached the highest level in the past two months against the euro, which “leads downwards to sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond amounted to 3.540% versus 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% versus 4.492% on the eve.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month’s South Africa tour, the 112 Miss World candidates are on the final straight to fulfill their dream: to be elected the world’s most beautiful woman in front of a billion viewers.
During this great celebration of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Beltran Pearl of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Athlete or even Miss Top Model during her stay in Africa.
It was a real upheaval.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw so many things and lived countless experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone astonished.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 p.m. GMT).
It is impossible to imagine a better country to deliver my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, notes Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the warmth of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, Miss World candidates focus on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned into Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, declares Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, the music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, in swimsuits.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee chief Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has proven to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of the Miss World contest.
Like last year, the candidates made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time on a bicycle, and tasted local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who tightened their hands.
Something unusual for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will definitely be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been dealing with people I never thought I'd meet.
She will probably return to the 2010 World Cup, says enthusiastic Miss Italia, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday’s news is “very positive,” according to son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he disembarked from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after local 13:00 (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, distressed, said he would move "as sooner" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday entered Monday due to an infection derived from the disc hernia surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "induced in coma since that night in Los Angeles for reasons of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the news service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been subjected to a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered Monday due to an infection, a sequel to a disc hernia surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated Wednesday night to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles, attended by his daughter Jade, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The Chief of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be next to the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer last November 26 at the international private clinic at Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
We are talking about a possible demand, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said Johnny Hallyday had traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon.
I spoke directly to the doctor and I was surprised when he assured me there was no problem making the trip, as I was operated twice with disc hernia, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he said the singer apparently had "gone without a cannula, with nothing", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux worked at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed following a brain bleeding.
He is a doctor with a poor reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions for mispractice, as well as for tax fraud and scam.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being “a man without scruples” sued “regularly” before the Council of the Order, and is “far from being recommended.”
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention "was carried out without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "couldn't cause bleeding and therefore didn't need drainage," he added.
Either way, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have been multiplying since the summer, entered into a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, it seems very risky to me, Camus said.
The UDF Association lifts the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by François Bayrou’s MoDem (Democratic Movement), reacted on Friday to the attempt of the president of the New Center, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Offer of Acquisition) on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, urging him to withdraw from any support, under penalty.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the UDF, considering that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political inheritance after extending his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Defense Minister, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his management, he received the help of the deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, current NC) who claims ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the deputy urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the property rights of the brand, under penalty of court suit.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you were going to propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, the association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Centrist Alliance.
They also believe it is correct to continue using the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in their militant material and on the presentation page of their site, the signatories of the letter argue.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that requires the NC to “immediately remove the mention of the UDF’s name from all support, as well as from (its) website.”
He also requests Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of the trademark to the legitimate rightholders."
If they do not, they will appeal to justice to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they point out that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "choosed" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP."
Therefore, the New Center has, according to them, no right to use the abbreviation UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 for its accession to the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the brand," he was no longer "member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
It scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do it on its own.
This indiscretion is turning into crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: “We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make one’s own name than trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one has no right.”
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for weakness abuse
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to bring artist François-Marie Banier to trial to determine whether, as billionaire daughter Liliane Bettencourt claims, she took advantage of the weak state of the eighteen-year-old to rob her of a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars from the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime whose sentence consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and €375,000 fine.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the wealthiest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87, to be subjected to a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal always refused to undergo such examinations, even more under the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
Doctors appointed on Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating whether and during which periods Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness.
I think he'll accept it.
“I’m going to talk to her,” said Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, when leaving the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ attorney Olivier Metzner was pleased with the court’s decision.
The expertise will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has initiated criminal lawsuits against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or works of art.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-standing friend.
On Friday, as the court examined the origin of the action filed by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ allegations resulted, on some occasions, in a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters her client had sent (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary in which she said she did not trust Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to talk to Françoise again."
For its part, the Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre once again held that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear, especially as a custody judge in recent days refused to give effect to her request to open a court proceeding for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to stand before justice, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No one else will be able to appear in his place,” said Marie-Christiine Daubigney, a representative of the public prosecutor’s office.
Finally, the court decided that it would proceed after the judgment was made on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managing Revolution or End of Business Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to "values" determined from above as it was previously about imposing on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution gave its place to strategies of conquest of the markets... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that are not related to the factors of preference of customers is repeated regularly.
A demobilization of employees can end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization severely compromises the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially of R&D and, even more, of business intelligence.
Indeed, the BI (Business Intelligence) “demands that all parties involved ... have proactive behavior and a forward-looking vision”; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we call for a managerial revolution, which would consist in putting employees at the center of the concerns of the company as well as the customer.
Internal opinion surveys have relative usefulness.
Will internal opinion surveys, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many lapses, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did!
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the ancient behaviorist theory that the American "neurosciences" recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media widely spread behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the “commands” (sic) of executive engagement, a recent Ipsos research published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a mechanistic management posture, inadapted to today’s world.
Identifying and measuring mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, implies adopting a finalistic vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating into every reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, engagement with the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make part of their dreams, ambitions and projects a reality.
Today, only studies from Motifuntional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies showed that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their own life projects.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of mobilization factors, business managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and relocate human resource management "in place".
In this way, they create a favorable ground for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo speech: for “just war” Obama receives praise from the right
On Friday, the U.S. right, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against U.S. enemies, praised the speech Obama had delivered on Thursday.
Conservatives, who had discredited the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former vice-presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, Mrs. Palin, the main figure of the Republican party’s right wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of war “sometimes necessary” in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing that the Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he observed.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, devoted himself Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech went really well, the former Chairman of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in presidential words.
For a moment, the speech seemed very historic to me, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former elected representative, who some consider to be a potential candidate for the Republican investiture for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear “a left-wing president” when he reminded members of the Nobel Committee “that they would not be free nor could they deliver a peace prize if the resort to force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current chronicler in the Washington Post, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as he “always does,” he “speaked like a U.S. president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few not very convinced right-wing, a Bush-era falcon, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “monoton, pretentious and lacking inspiration” on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech a "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech “should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California newspaper commented enthusiastically.
Obama “pronounced the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times said, deeming it “sunny and edifying at the same time.”
Road transport: three marathon negotiations to ensure Christmas supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the unions of the road sector and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employer organization that remained until the end, came to an agreement on Friday afternoon that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supply.
During the signing session on Friday night, Transportation Secretary Dominique Bussereau was "joyed" over the deal, following several negotiating sessions that began Wednesday morning.
Following a second night of discussions, the negotiators said goodbye at dawn Friday in the hopes of quickly signing the text according to late morning.
Even when three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew by giving a doorstep.
But a meeting of more than six hours that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text was signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "had been very harmful to businesses" and "was feared that it would disturb the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It’s not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantages, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there are no further cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some disgusting rebels, he added.
Philippe Grillot, chairman of the TLF, acknowledged that this is "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages taking into account international competition."
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros per month for the low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects employees, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historical agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is “an acceptable compromise.”
The agreement also envisages an increase in travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow to address the issue of extraordinary pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a €100 million drop in employer burdens" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 rectification finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote “under the same terms.”
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply, firstly, to companies joining this organization and, secondly, to the entire profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
Opposition by employer organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced that it was a “naive business,” as the €100 million had “already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the CO2 tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to not contradict those who want to eat turkey at the next Christmas Eve dinner, Unostra lamented.
For OTRE, the agreement threatens “the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months.”
RER A: Weekend conflicts, unions disagree with RATP proposals
The conflicts on the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the 2nd day of strike between unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., at the rate of one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train in four on the other lines.
The interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Préfecture, which will force passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which await 200,000 customers each day, were pleased that “RATP strives to provide service to the big stores.”
The RER A crosses from west to east the city of Paris.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, approximately one in two trains traveled in peak hours, and almost no train in valley hours, as planned.
On Thursday there was no disorder in the runways thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Île de France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had risen "an hour and a half earlier to arrive at schedule."
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had envisaged supervision of police and law enforcement forces.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from the Saint-Lazare station to join the metro stations.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, will be analyzed from a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for the RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers want who claim a premium that is owed to them, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT commented outraged, noting that the direction "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to conduct "a more extensive analysis of the conditions of the profession's exercise," the RATP said.
Which also led the unions to say that the company "doesn't care about weekend users."
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters in Paris.
Then the management, which until then refused to talk during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters."
The conflict could extend to the RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independents had filed a notice.
The unions request a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Independents) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has a million passengers per day.
RER drivers, all in the second degree of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros premiums, for alternate shift hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday in favor of the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately sparked manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the country's southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just helped the Kurdish community trying to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that damaged the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kiliç told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to obtain the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party’s leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysel Tugluk, were separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity that Türk and Tugluk enjoyed, and the confiscation of party property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that MPs would leave parliament before being parliamentarians without a party label.
The decision comes as a result of a proceeding launched by Supreme Court Attorney Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007 accusing the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s verdict intervenes as the government helps the Kurdish community propose a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to stop the Kurds from supporting the PKK and thus put an end to the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan degenerated into clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the Southeast populated mostly by Kurds.
The Order forces threw tear grenades and used water cannons, while the protesters threw Molotov bombs or stones with depths.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
Following the verdict, Türk said the justice decision was going to "deepen the discouragement."
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party coming from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
This is nothing to be resolved, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic opening launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK awarded itself an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snowfalls can start suddenly
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It’s at all something you want to make life impossible for citizens, comments FES’ winter road maintenance director
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master the entire vehicle technology.
On the weekend, meteorologists may announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to deal with snow and ice.
In this case, the ESF acts in accordance with a thorough plan.
As soon as it profusely snows in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called sections A leave with large vehicles with salt, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also accesses for the firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and slope sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service begins around 3 a.m.
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as necessary, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is best adhered.
That’s why the FES starts around three o’clock in the morning, “with this the tracks are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins.”
The hard thing is when it starts snowing around 7:30 p.m.
“Then we have a problem,” says the director of winter road maintenance, “because then no one is ready to clear space to the vehicles with salt.”
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it comes to the secondary and private roads, to which also belongs the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That’s where the discomfort is generated, Brauburger knows well.
Around five in the morning the FES infantry is launched, mainly hazardous points and cruises are cleared.
Usually, the FES could not take over all of the bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which from 22.00 to 4.30 p.m. does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, Brauburger comments.
As these become slippery quickly, the vehicle with salt starts as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of emergency, the police can also call them.
The dinosaur's cradle
The Tawa hallae looked the same as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters tall that ran over the two strong rear legs, had an elongated head with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle-shaped claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of millions of years later, this would not have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangea in the equator.
Tawa opened a new window toward the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the genealogical relationships, propagation and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, this is something unprecedented for Triasic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
The researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation they gathered in total the remains of five specimens.
A find confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional finding: "Triasian dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share such enthusiasm at all.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts debate, for example, when the sauries were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the sauropods quadruped known as the "long neck" and their relatives, and the Trinithisch species.
According to Nesbitt and his colleagues' analysis, Tawa hachae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, Nesbitt comments.
For example, in the skull of Tawa, researchers found signs of airbags, such as those that also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to airbags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa findae, the bones of the spine were obviously partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, comments Randall Irmis.
Because the related line of the later giant sauropods also possessed airbags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migratory waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far known lived in South America, researchers deduced that sauries first emerged there.
Consequently, the three genealogical lineages were initially separated and spread from South America across all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single earth mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say the team found along with Tawa find the remains of two other theropods not very closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single relative predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migratory waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study Science.
Of course, there are also opponents.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a brother group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, comments Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their opinion could give a distorted image, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is barely anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs evolved from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic remains an enigma.
While in the Triasic dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other sauries.
Towards the end of the Triassic dinosaurs spread all over the world and many new species developed, while the kinship extinct at the limit of the Triassic to the Jurassic.
Successful stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, Martin Sander comments.
It could have been a massive extinction that dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or dinosaurs were better adapted, so they were able to defeat opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact halts the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triasic and since then had a miserable existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California participate.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction from the busy casino at the Goethe University of Frankfurt impacted all over the world.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, but also from higher education institutions throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarizing with students in protest at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the management board.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted last week the building occupied by students and teachers on educational strike, because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students suffered injuries.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify “the violent dissolution of courses organized by the students and professors themselves by a police command.”
The eviction represented an “unacceptable attack” on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served for “delegitimization and criminalization of protest” and diverted attention from content.
The Executive Board has refused to initiate the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the court complaint.
Most occupants have not caused material damage, it is said.
Legitimated protests
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Federation of Trade Unions are also solidarizing with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, comments Verdi’s national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hessen defended, however, the performance of the rector of the university and the police.
We are grateful to the rector of the university.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in a broadcast of Aktuelle Stunde Thursday in the parliament of Wiesbaden province.
We are comprehensive of the protest, but we are not comprehensive of vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a provincial parliamentary deputy for the CDU.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the Left, is different.
The CDU used the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying the arguments and demands of students, they are evicted.
The Left has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strongly guarded site for secret arms investigation.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from downtown Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers for micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg scientist headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "Narrow Collaboration Protocol" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Juri Rosljak and Selengrad Mayor Anatoly Smirnov led the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt signed head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science research center will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set a foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of important Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortia Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "City of Socialist Planning" for Arms Research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the landscape of wooded mountains, in which research facilities were settled.
Stuttgart brakes
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not placed at all high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate to the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irreparable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with rails, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brakes of modern rail traffic, since it used to take an enormous amount of time to hook the locomotives back and forth.
Rotate, dry stop continue the journey; but this must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is approximately halfway through the trans-European operating lines between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be launched, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost unpaid to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course also have no more entry and exit problems, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver’s carriage on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE section to Ulm will be started.
Federal and communal politicians have done so.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are carried by the taxpayer and not by the State.
From an urbanistic point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the computer-generated graphics of the designer.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The passing station and road support are designed for the transport of people, which was attributed to the enormous growth typical of the 1980s.
At the time there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first deal with strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is considerably more green than that carried out by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections in construction are good for freight trains due to intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros must be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is sure that in the next decade money will be lacking in other narrow crossings and passages on the net.
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails across the Rhine valley.
The slow-paced trail has been built since 1987.
It would be urgent here to step on the accelerator as appropriate.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The section of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment on the airport.
The federal government leaves pending in the Wiesbaden parliament if it is going to file an appeal before the ruling on the prohibition of night flights by the Hesse administrative court.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the 400-page VGH judgment, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The administrative court in Kassel had substantiated in writing that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport, the state would have to re-regulate the ban on night flights.
Admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as foreseen by the federal government, would be inconsistent with compulsory legal protection of the noise population due to air traffic.
The coalition has to decide by January 4, whether it is going to file an appeal against this judgment.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to renounce the appeal to the Nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of a ban on night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It’s pretty difficult, if one is allowed to keep his word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP’s slogan “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's blame, which the federal government would be trying to obtain his night flights through law mistakes and tricks.
A thorough legal investigation would take a lot of time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a “fast first impression.”
We need a legally impeccable decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As the opposition represents, it would never have been his group’s claims about the ban on night air traffic.
The U.S. banks return the aid.
The big U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are stripping their state bonds.
The "Bank of America" returned at once the aid provided to it by the Tarp bank rescue fund of a total of 45 billion (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return state aid, according to a U.S. CNBC report.
With this, the institutes aim to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation of the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had earned approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken from the box itself, which had a lot of means, among others for the sale of rubs.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers especially on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the investment bank’s absorption at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi group also aims to get money in the capital market to be able to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from a source of known circles that the U.S. bank could announce by Thursday its capital increase of $20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group did not wish to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were returned.
Quick election
In the end, it all went faster than you thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF (German television channel) board pressed editorial chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may introduce a successor.
Yesterday night the group wanted to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of ZDF’s main studio in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially not to anticipate the proceedings.
But it probably also influenced not harming ZDF director Markus Schächter further, if this proposal would not be approved in the board either.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The result of the vote was not yet concrete at the closure of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the board with his proposal to renew for another five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's dismissal was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the administrative council had indicated weeks before the election that they would not support Brender in his position.
The opposition against the editorial head had been organized by the Hesse government president, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another mandate from the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument that under Brender’s leadership the ZDF news reports would have lost audience rates.
Until shortly before the election there were protests because of this, in which political influence was flogged on the ZDF.
At the end of the debate, 35 public law specialists had even interfered in the debate, who described Koch’s conduct as unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He later worked on the station "Südwestfunk" and the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 it was changed to the ZDF, in principle to the informative "aujournal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal rapporteur of the editorial head; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the ZDF study in the capital.
The Greens political party announced a constitutional lawsuit following Brender’s dismissal, who was elected as a journalist of the year by the media magazine Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Unlike Koch in the administrative council, the president of the Rhineland-Palatinate government explained last week that the states should change the ZDF state agreement in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A retreat of politicians supporting the ZDF control groups was dismissed by Beck.
Brender's likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with a smart move: he strongly criticized the board for Brender's dismissal.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence both Schächter was able to appoint him to the post of editorial chief without losing his face, as the administrative council was able to vote on him, without falling under the suspicion of giving him the post to a supporting sequeaz.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded anyway to the left liberals.
College careers are cleared
Partial success for students: After a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the states finally ceded.At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university rectors, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in bachelor and master cases.
Students in the future should be able to exceed their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the exam burden: basically each module of the race must be completed with only one exam.
It is also intended to examine the workload of the students, and it is intended to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities want to further simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federal states are committed to making more flexible the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Rules of states that diverge from this should no longer exist.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the directors of universities are continuously talking about improving the ability to successfully carry out and complete a career (studiability).
Now for the first time we talked about a specific content.
The so-called accreditation council agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module ends with one exam," is stated in a 30-page document, which intends to partially regulate the approval of university careers.
The "sensitive reduction of the burden of exams" aims to avoid development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, as explained by the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Furthermore, in the future "studyability" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of..
the courses.
Students would have "the right to gain more spaces, which enable and encourage their own initiative."
These rules would apply for new careers, but also in the examination of existing careers.
These must be "re-accredited" once every five years, but this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation council, which is set up by the states.
The Ministers of Education and Culture urged the states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
Until now only Rhineland-Platz has provided additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student tutoring and counselling programs, as well as strengthening exam offices and abroad.
The state and universities intend to have 10 million euros available for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring a novel of university law to parliament.
According to her, a single exam should be enough for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the career should be made more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of assessments at other universities and facilitating accessibility to the Master.
By the end of next year it is intended to examine all careers about their "studiability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the state.
Aside from the praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal-level board of the Juso university groups (Young Socialists) demanded that education policy setup should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" of ministers and university directors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, now students as major involved should be able to comment as well.
The chairman of the university board of directors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to the students: “We need the experience of the students,” he said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education, with whom the HRK deliberated on a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not entirely sufficient: the union demands a legal right for each student with the Bachelor’s degree the possibility of accessing a later Master’s career.
Furthermore, the states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there will be enough places to study for the Master in the future with the best possible conditions of study, according to a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The states have to hire a lot more teachers.
But about greater access to the master’s degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
“Entering and leaving Germany is virtually uncontrolled,” says the first line of a poem by the lyrical Werner Söllner in unbalanced idiomatic fragments, in which he thematizes the experiences of arriving in Germany lived by a dissident, who won his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children’s book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literature awards, in 1993 he gave memorable lessons or lectures of poetry in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the literature forum in Hesse at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He spoke a lot last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of its Securitate files"
Visiblely unsafe and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow Romanian-German writers including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
The recruitment attempts had started slowly, in early 1971.
“So I’m someone who didn’t defend himself sufficiently against Securitate’s fear-provoking attempts,” Söllner concluded.
The lyrical Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors originating in Romania was shaken by a case that evidences the abyss and the evil of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, so far known, not only author, but also victim.
In his Securitate IM record Walter had played a role, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, and stressed the positive influence for him of IM Walter.
He had excused or defended him in all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge for spies from the Securitate-Spitzel, wrote Herta Müller in the weekly "Zeit" in July, after reading her own 914-page file.
Those involved will surely have speculated and will have known in some cases, what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, Securitate’s handling of the control files is still fairly diffuse.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hindered in recent years.
A national council for the clarification of the Securitate files (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the delivery of the files since then is rather traced.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, following the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large.
“She has psychosis,” she was only interrogated once in the end.
The infamy of power seemed to be shown without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, inevitable questions arise with the Söllner case, as many times when there are silent guilts.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession lets hope that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the cravings for knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in Literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from his team supplier, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, it felt like an elegantly dressed outdoor service member was coming out of a very pleasant Christmas celebration, in which the sports goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The man of the bald characteristic had hired a driver, because he did not yet know the city.
He could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk of joy either.
It had been a nice evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we have reached the eighths of the final," namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by success: we will have to fight brutally against the descent."
The "much more important task" awaited them next Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Maguncia the success of the "royal classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly evidenced again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sorteo
The eighth finals of the Champions League (departure games on 16/17 and 23/24 February/round games 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy remained limited by Babbel's successor's fulminant entry.
Not only in the supposed savior, which in a short time had inspired the confused pros of Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to surrender and pleasure for the game.
I went with the players and told them they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more thrown, soul repairer Gross explained his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with therapist Babbel had no longer come into effect.
He deployed some magic, accepted Babbel’s supporter Jens Lehmann, “When a new momentum arises in football, sometimes things happen that would not have been thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who after a several weeks break due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what had been missing, obviously, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not passed the test yet, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs mainly persistence.
Like Gross, the players and the administrator also refrained from overvaluing the triumph against a weakened defense due to lack of relief and totally overtaken by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had arrived the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And director Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been reached, the other was still far away.
We haven't overcome the problem yet.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate on his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, awarded by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make, and not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
The latter had reproached weakness in the direction of the board of directors, which had decided to change coach due to the pressure of teenage fans.
Also that his day off after the games was eliminated, Lehmann called it a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness,” Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the latter.
They will probably no longer be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with all the others that without the previous efforts with the replaced coach’s team, the show of great game and battle force would not have been possible.
Babbel and her attendees had "a significant involvement in success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the plastic suitcase man also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship Fight
Burning mourning in Bern: over and over again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judge’s trial was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson by unanimous point decision (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Friday-Saturday night in Bern.
For Klitschko was his third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice the world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout that everyone had expected could not be accomplished.
Klitschko extended his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators at the Berne Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight mostly with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower than before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was dodging the world champion’s blows over and over again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right-wing to his target.
In general terms, Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve complete rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already produced some scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a “horrible zombie,” who “knows nothing.”
While weighing, the champion was provoked on Friday to remove Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so that he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a nearly four-year break, he defeated then Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered his WBC belt, which he had previously had to hand over without fighting.
That year he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I only received a blow, and I am in very good physical condition, had Klitschko explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to bring together all four major titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is the world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall in November.
Last summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko planned for September.
The company that promotes it is supposedly already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called the Minister of Defense, Gutenberg, a liar because of false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the leftists demand explanation from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about Kunduz’s airstrike, the opposition has accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of deceiving with knowledge.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast on ARD television channel, the head of the Greens group, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister "had not knowingly told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he said lies.
The order to kill would have been issued without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday it was announced that this attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left urged Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of intentional murder is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy, and whether the foreign ministry, the army and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast demanded.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, decidedly rejected criticism.
The Foreign Ministry exerted no influence on concrete actions by the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday there were also doubts about the Ministry’s presentation on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector-General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and thoroughly about the background of the attack on the convoys.
It had been officially said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two high-ranking officials it transcends that they had even reported to the Ministry of Defense the existence of several reports, including a two-page document of Colonel Klein, who was in charge, and a report of a field patrol.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, the Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports.
So far, no response has been received, it was said.
The ministry did not speak on Saturday regarding the reproaches made to it, noting that this would be clarified in the Federal Parliament investigation committee, which will be formed next Wednesday.
Oniric worlds
In a vigilant state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of mentally ill people and drug addicts, the boundaries between imagination and reality are fading away.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender without barriers to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during waking up, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is considered most of the time in the modern Western world as crazy or drug addict, or at least as a maniac.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mentally ill or the drugged.
The fault is our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels, sometimes make the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality uncovered.
Onirically modified alert states of consciousness may appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although triggers and effects can be distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, the states of shamanic possession, and psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been disrupted and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disturbed.
During a schizophrenic psychosis very often complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts appear.
Gravity no longer has power over it.
The relationship between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with the oniric states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the unintended and unlocalized forms".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
Its body is two-dimensional and scandalously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over it, it's floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red muzzles like blood, deformed, scratching their teeth.
They are chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, thrown him against the walls, he feels the pains throughout the body.
Striking and evil voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls out two cables from the stereo, ties them together to form a hanging knot, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
It climbs into a horn and puts the knot around the neck.
Jump. Jump.
The rope is loosened.
“What a lesson for you!” shout the voices in a choir that breaks his tympanes, “Go to the clinic and have them heal you!”
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that caused it was LSD.
Its diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, in addition it is maniac-depressive, takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the lifetime of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inner world, and fall into a state of overexcitation that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of greatness, relationship disorders, or persecutionary mania.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain is no longer able to filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the gates to a stream of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says professor Thomas Fuchs, chief doctor of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time he enters a passive role, as in a dream, he feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenic people often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remain in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, distancement from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers, it is still unknown why our brain makes cabrioles.
According to Fuchs, states of exception can lead anyone to lose contact with reality on a temporary basis.
But not all people develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains an unknown how this alteration of the neural system occurs, which also does not manifest itself at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a pre-disposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitting system of the brain.
When the brain warms up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer from their hallucinations and take very expensive medications to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experiment with some, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been compiling reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf, published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychosis, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
These include, along with psychic disorders such as boundary personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and cranial brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people also suffers from hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are made up of memories that are normally repressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or poorly cohibited; when our brain gets warm, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, sickness of love or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported having experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and went to a high school.
A regular girl.
If not for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a foolish boy with long, dark hair speaks to him.
When she replies, the other students look at her surprised; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a little strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she's not dreaming.
She is awake and goes and hears that guy, just like she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You can even feel your presence, at least a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
In the evenings, the appearances are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class he can’t sometimes follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is presenting a new companion, while for the rest he explains the mathematical equations in a visible and audible manner.
In the evenings, the appearances are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for sleep to come, which often comes late and is scarce, she cannot distinguish whether she is awake or dreaming, whether the images she sees, the muddles or the girl with bleeding cuts in her arms and legs, appear in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, scream to the figures.
She hasn’t told her parents and friends anything, they would think she’s crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She approved selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
It's been a year since hallucinations have disappeared.
Since she got in touch with psychologist Kasten over the Internet, she knows she’s not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person is socially isolated or suffers from a stimulus restriction, it is highly likely that after a while he will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and is responsible for finding entertainment.
Sarah K., the only daughter, was little afraid of the other children and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at age 13, he learned that the man he calls dad since he has been using reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected like Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality. "Every experience," Kasten says, "has place in the brain, reality projects there.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, psychically healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that his patients appreciate their hallucinations as a special skill.
Boundary situation between sleep and hallucination
In this world too conscious, imaginary experiences are usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful illness but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Oniric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers to be real and that can subsequently not differentiate from being awake.
Oniric conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or illness, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis being fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of himself or the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, it replaces a very dangerous real situation with a self-imagined world that is detached from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an unbearable situation in itself that our own ability to create allows us not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich describes his onic experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action of salvation of the soul.
He was 49 years old when his consciousness embarked on several-day trips after a heart valve surgery with included heart transplant, while his body was doomed to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places of other times: he saw himself bowed in bed, an older man aboard a sanatorium in a train, a robot watched over his health.
It was seen in the high Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle kidnapped him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow and met a Korean mafioso.
It gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, these indoor trips are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so it describes your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intensive than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and drug consumption show how fragile the inner reproduction of external reality is, even when we are awake.
Every modification of the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
Snow can come
Burda
The children will take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new editor Kallen has come to a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two children, he told Spiegel.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Editor Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have a firm willingness to enter the company, confirmed Burda, 69, to SPIEGEL.
Details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if they are trained to do so.
One cannot put his children in front of 7,500 workers if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end the kids and also the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will withdraw from chairmanship of the board of directors from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the 52-year-old Kallen family has been a member of Burda's management since 1999.
At first he was responsible for the technology.
After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over direct marketing, overseas, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publisher.
Burda's sons are 19 and 17 years old. His son Felix, now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
With a look at Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said family businesses are also not safe from the decline: “This has always affected families that are infected by the search for capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I’ve never had “delusions of greatness,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor for this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with the “Time” in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything you can desire – in terms of beauty and well-being – within reach of your hand.
This is what appears to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and mime of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai - which takes care of laser hair removal-; Spaxión, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which owns a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the tea is highlighted, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and a cup of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxion.
A total of 250 m2 are distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these machines, as well as virtual 'coaches' that guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts by entering your personal key on a touch screen in front of the machine.
So, several videos show us how to do our exercise table correctly.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles in the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where rituals of hair recovery, brightness or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 a.m. to 22:00 p.m.
Various necklaces
Christmas is approaching and you are never going to review the looks of the stars to suit our party clothes.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must consider.
There are a few suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the City Council of Barcelona, have created the 'Oficina LIVE'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The Office LIVE (Logistics for the Deployment of Electric Vehicles) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the deployment of electric cars in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it aims to boost what the transportation of the future will be.
3 'electric cities'
But Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the deployment of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to drive the deployment of the electric vehicle.
The power company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
This aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy and in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a quiet horizon' for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, looks at "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
In the presentation of the President of the Government’s Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero reviewed the measures the Executive has taken throughout the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, the closure of some of our main production plants,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the readiness of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a peace of mind horizon for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3 billion.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to modernizing existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized governmental demand-support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market by 6% and has led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting space for professionals and fans of the engine.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Crystal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters on which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only can you find motorcycles and classic cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche car sales and restoration; or Cochera Clásicos, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill testing abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be completed with parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and contests.
Skill tests will also be performed on classic cars and motorcycles on an enabled circuit outside the fairground.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sustainable Sports
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sportivity is not a matter of respect for the environment.
For this reason, it has just incorporated into the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system – named as i-Stop – a device that at least for now is only available with the gasoline 2.0 engine with 150 horsepower.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good score achieved in its entirety.
The finishes, the finishing of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving position, we verify that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and support.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Following the set formed by the instrument board and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic as well.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this Japanese compact features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large luggage room with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for now, is only available with the two-liter 150 horsepower gasoline engine and with the manual six-speed gearshift.
This engine is a true delight. It stands out for its finesse, its reduced rumor, its performance and its consumption.
And it is that although the most sought after Mazda3 will be the diesel versions, those who do not make a high number of kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high driving comfort, and for its consumption content.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. the one that incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
From the standard equipment especially stands out the lane change assistant (RVM) that eliminates dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive inner mirror, onboard computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
Furthermore, if it were its equipment, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenone headlights and BOSE sound system with disk charger, among other elements.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It is particularly highlighted by the quality of the materials used, their behaviour and the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 horsepower.
The only inconvenience of this model is its high price, which ranges between the 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and the 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high number, the Mazda3 will offer us great doses of satisfaction every day.
'Premiere' of luxury
L.A. covers the sensual red carpet of the hand of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexy' at the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at the mail, without even the possibility of seeing a certain type of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance cost, of around 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those traveling with a smartphone already know what it’s like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately search for a cafeteria with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to check the mail.
The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and would have been running for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and some good glasses to read the small letter.
The repeated ears of the European Commission to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is fear of using the data, and rightly.
That a device like FonPeek (when it is not Wifi) gets this type of rates means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no gaits.
It is a connected device and is paid for when you buy it, not month to month.
And that’s what I hope to see someday with FonPeek, a lifetime-accessed purchase option like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it is a more fair model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the first lady.
If Barack Obama has already taken office as President of the United States in a dress and coat of this color, he has chosen him to accompany him in, undoubtedly, the second most important moment of his life: the Oslo pick-up of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color - green yellow with bright reflections - the twice outfit consisted of three pieces - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric - and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of the United States followed the steel of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestury.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for taking possession he tried a fat lace, in Oslo it is a velvet with print.
Add-ons have also varied: green half-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but golden, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one collected this time, melena releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women from younger generations who want to become mothers.
This is revealed by the study ‘Fecundity and Trajectory of Women in Spain’, prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of couple coexistence and the number of children, depending on whether or not they work and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, start coexistence before, advance first maternity, and have more children.
On the contrary, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
Women aged 35 to 49 with fixed work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting coexistence, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their vital career to achieve them, which has led them to postpone union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a great deal of influence on maternity but less on the timing of pairing,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of study is another factor that distinguishes the age of women when they marry and when they have the first stem.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which they marry and the age at which they have the first child.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, women with elementary and higher studies were first mothers at average 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
Another division among women is also established based on their level of education.
While those who have elementary studies marry and have their first child before getting a stable job, those of middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its envious list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, chanting the universal motto of 'Because I am worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris films, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Losts') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millonaire').
In the male section, the cosmetic brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (‘Anatomy of Grey’) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s companion in ‘Lost’).
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His highest representatives – designers and models, yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicent's poker
Manuel Vicent gives in 'Póquer de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) a thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in some cases, also through the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and fearful genres (biographical likeness, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent spares no scare or illumination.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a touching invitation to readings and re-reads.
Here are some snapshots.
Albert Camus: “In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same that I felt without name: pleasure against aziatic fate, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
“Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in the blood, not in the intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him.”
“Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition.”
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulises' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, one of the peaks of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed through the northern wall, from which the best climbers are slid over and over again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he once said that he was heir to a county landlord and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were of greatness.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the demented cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to bring his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century in his literary form and did so on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed, ‘God dear, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.’”
About Joseph Conrad: "About his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'Sleep after effort,/ after storm the harbor,/ rest after war,/ after life tired pleases death."
Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage she also brought her depressions.
The husband normally accepted that she told her that Edward VII spyed on her among the Azaleans or that the birds sang in Greek.
There has never been the case of a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet try but to pass Baroja through Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do except to take away the fame of that man so that he could serve as his own pedestal?”
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed alongside her and our dog, a mixed breed, rescued from the puppy and weighing no more than six kilos and, without a word, she was given two kicks that left the ill-wounded dog.
Our indignation is capital because we do not find fun in a free aggression against a small and helpless animal, which, by the way, was bound.
To this must be added the suffocation that provoked a lady who walked quietly and who, when he incribed these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energy that attacks an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly or, ultimately, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event occurred at five o’clock on any Tuesday afternoon in a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we placed a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt it would serve for much and to not generate susceptibility, just clarify that the cowards killers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand that it is happening among young people so that they consider it fun to abus for free a helpless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has been.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among younger riders, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while driving on a motorcycle.
Michelin said this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and said it also contributes to this goal through other actions of a pedagogical and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote helmet use in the motorcycle, under the motto ‘To be or not to be’, will have a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of two-wheel tyres, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safer products.
Sale of light commercials increases
Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employer of the manufacturers Anfac and that of the sellers Ganvam.
The good fact, not osbtant, should be put in quarantine since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly poor, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
Consequently, despite the upturn of the last month, the accumulated registrations in these 11 months are 40% lower than in the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold together with all the vehicles that make up the tailor drawer of light commercials: passenger car derivatives, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Also, the clouds that affect its demand most have not disappeared, because although they are also acquired by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in nearly 100% of cases through external financing.
In addition to the restrictions imposed by the closed tap on bank loans, other factors must be added, such as increased unemployment levels or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In view of this panorama and unlike passenger cars, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has served little.
In addition to individuals, self-employed persons and SMEs who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been testimony.
Yesterday, from Ganvam, they recalled the need to pay special attention by the Administration to these vehicles and also to the industrialists (trucks and buses).
The vendor association predicts a 2010 similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is already mandatory
As with the anti-blocking of ABS brakes and will pass with the ESP stability control, emergency braking aid systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a lack period is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, because of their way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions per range.
The emergency braking assistant is to increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects by the tramp that the driver gives.
But it doesn’t always keep that pressure up to the end.
According to a study conducted by the car component manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not reached the brake before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum from the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 deadly accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented a year.
The reduction will be even greater - it is estimated that one in four accidents with damage to people would be avoided - when so-called smart emergency braking systems become popular.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (via radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps you increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While workers at Opel’s plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April – likely on day 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the U.S. manufacturer warns that it will need more time to complete the recovery plan for Opel.
What Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants is that each of the points in the plan has been previously agreed by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document to be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries in which there are factories to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days.
This is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but takes on the choice of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is backed by Russian group Converg.
In case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to China's Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is maintained if it does not sell.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to lose no less than 80 pounds, leaving the scale at just 1,275 pounds.
This led them to do without, first of all, the automatic roof that has been replaced by a canvas with manual drive, saving 21 pounds; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'fall' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, they gained 7 pounds more; riding the 19 other sports cars.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system brought another six kilograms and changing the door shooters for ones of cloth, the remaining kilogram.
Although also offered with the double clutch PDK gear, the test was conducted on a drive with the six-speed manual box, mainly on California’s secondary roads, in mountain sections with truly turned paths.
Their behaviour can only be described as impeccable.
Weight reduction does not imply that the car does not step on the asphalt with aplomb.
Rather, the opposite: we hadn’t tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time that, at the same time, transmitted so much safety in the turn-by-curve, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, capable of heating his muscles in a short walk for the time necessary, until we order him to sprinter, brake, recover and squeeze his motor again...
Whatever we ask. Thanks to your address, as communicative as precise, what we indicate with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is highly achieved and can be enhanced with the ‘sport’ option and through a system that modifies the engine’s noise, previously released on the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, either on the ground or in recoveries.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car digested the bumps well.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in one of the curves we found ice at dawn and gravel, and well in the morning.
In short, an ultra-light car, one of the most fun driving one can on the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
'Bag Girl'
Intimate of Karl lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'house' parades, the singer prodigies her bag face with as much contumacy as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's a 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia wins a victory in Israel
The Labor Caja achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in its visit to the complicated court of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous losses with which the team of Dusko Ivanovic had, and thus places itself in the leadership of its group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, which with eight triples scored was the best of its team (29 scores).
The Victorian team was able to supplie the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with large doses of involvement and collective work but had to suffer until the end to win.
In addition, the great success from the perimeter, with 16 triples scored, had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match started face-to-face for the bluegranas, who were put from the start ahead in the scoreboard.
That the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already indicated that they had jumped onto the Israeli court with their hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main creators from 18-20 to the end of the first part.
The second quarter was more than the same, but the alavés team opted for Barac's indoor play and Eliyahu's work, who was welcomed with pits and applause on the return to his home, to continue expanding his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'less six' rating already predicted that this would not be the best night of the Brazilian.
But the match, despite being on track for rest, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court no one wins, and with the ‘hand of Elijah’ squeezing they managed to get into the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellows' turning the luminous (50-49).
More disadvantages
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but not much less dead, needed to thread a couple of steps to get air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three nearly triples consecutive and the help of English and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring income (54-67), who got the locals make-up at the end of the third (57).
The alaves went out to leave their skin in the last partial and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already warned that they would not let anyone take away what had been deserved during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of his team did not resign and tried to keep his team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the game already owned and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent the Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost strikingly in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Euroleague Group B, in a game marked by the cash players' losses, especially in the inland game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship and not by the rival’s entity, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from Omar Cook base and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, when an action, fighting conato, between the two American bases Beverley and Williams, meant the disqualification of both players.
The Greek set began to function by showing its superiority within both zones, where the injury loss of the English pivot Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez, were blowing the drawers.
Between the indoor players and the Lithuanian alero Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the 44-32 edge, minute 19.
An impossible rebound
The third period was very offensive with the Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, showed itself superior and even came to equal the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the lead of the group shaking.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last loss of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite all the drawbacks of the Unicaja for Cook's management and triples, and Lewis' contribution, it left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos when pressed and given its superiority in centimeters within the area proved unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to pick up the average basketball 81-62, 37 minute, and the Unicaja went off, handing over the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads of real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers available by Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is in operation, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data Trovit has of its search engines in the UK and France, the Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 gross euros per year and a French one, 31,059, compared to the 24,000 received by a Spanish one.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 euros net annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by a dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of an operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are drivers, half-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010, when his term of office officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date of the embassy, where he has remained a refugee since September 21.
“He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he has to look for another destiny.”
The broadcast also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the set deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the government of Brazil," Zelaya declared via telephone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek shelter in Brazil.
The operation was finally frustrated by rejecting Zelaya’s political asylum status, which was intended to impose on him by the “de facto” government chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant emphasis on the markets, again the uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by uncertainty of nature.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by direct purchasing assets and indirectly giving liquidity-free bars to near-zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to deduct.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, start to throw some sand on the gears as the ECB did with its year-on-year auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatilities of the stock exchanges and the differentials of corporate bonds have rebounded, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
The states were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the U.S., Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differences between the eurozone countries and Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this instability episode but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new review to the decline of the rating of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence moral risk advocates who were trying to re-create awareness on those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what should be done is to decree a new Thanksgiving Day.
However, what happens in Dubai paints like a tribal struggle between the Emirs to rebuild power in the Emirates, and what happens in Greece we’ve seen before.
A government that hides public deficit, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from a failure to comply with its foreign payments earlier this year and to allow a euro member country to breach its commitments.
What makes sense is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to make its citizens co-responsible of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of normalization of the transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within the expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt differentials increase as European corporate bonds should not be worried.
If European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise upwards their 2011 scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not suggest much life expectancy to your warning.
Again, it has all the appearance that it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although at the moment "prudence, friend driver".
Related sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which today is discussing Spain’s energy strategy in the next two decades.
After his speech, followed by that of Gas Natural-Fenosa president Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushes of what he had raised in the subcommittee behind closed doors.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, as long as the nuclear power plants remain open today.
Otherwise, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue will change and the power will need to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energy.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, that yes, with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who considers that the Sustainable Economy Bill that the government has just passed is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the royal decree to encourage domestic coal consumption, which contradicts climate change policies.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "on-time" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán considers that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should be started as they are maturing delayed and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Railway wins Aer Lingus’ handling at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary of onshore airport services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports in which it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, of which the economic terms have not transcended, has a duration of five years.
Furthermore, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Center
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which corresponds to Ferrovial.
One of the centre’s tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency in highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
She fights for her first concession motorway in Australia, a market in which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are their rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the nearest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a builder and motorway dealer.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private partnership (PPP) to advance the project, in a business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to take the work and exploit the toll.
Pending their bids in May, the investment is expected to amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros) and in the last phase three consortia are competing with a remarkable presence of European builders.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spaniard in Liza, and his companions are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French builder group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where they share capital the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German builder Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but it entails a clear difficulty of entry if not through the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that the abovementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger have followed, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants of the sector.
Just ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of said Leighton.
Millionaire assets
It bets on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy provider and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of lifting and managing the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The underground toll route, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link, is called to link the Toowong West Highway with the Kelvin Grove Circuit Route along 5 kilometers of tunnel, which is the largest step to reduce Brisbane traffic congestion.
The calendar set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would be open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is not expected that the work will be finished until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Government of Queensland will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to its financing.
Brisbane now offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to bear remarkable results to Hochtief, who yesterday announced the obtaining of a contract with the Government valued at 154 million.
ACS will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give the German woman work for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has passed the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the Australian city of Brisbane, with works yet to begin and Hochtief has closed sales at 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC awards a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a Slovenian highway for €64.5 million.
The firm gets this contract days after completing the expansion works of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the works is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and its execution period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore awards Renfe's advertising
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore for an amount of approximately three million euros per year, the railway operator reported.
Ms. Rushmore has been chosen among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition convened by Renfe, of which four remained finalists, including TBWA, which was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom is fined $63 million for curbing competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of €63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to the institution, the operator limited competition in fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programs outside of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competent authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore reoccurring.
App Store
On the other hand, the French company’s mobile subsidiary has followed the path of other operators and has opened an online app store, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
In principle, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
We will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origin
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
So much, that Real Madrid and Barcelona have entered 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club that has earned the most money in the competition.
The leader on the list is Manchester United.
The leader on the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only provides glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
So much so, the competition has distributed €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/93 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have been well off in this cast.
The white club has been the third in the continent to earn the most money for participating, and the only one, alongside AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth of the qualifying.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also billed the most money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country that has earned the most money through the Champions League, despite having earned more titles than any other (five, for the four in Italy, the three in England and the two in Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated cash-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body chaired by Michel Platini plans to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each match they competed.
There are also bonuses to win (800,000 euros) and to draw (400,000 for each team). The eighth finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarter finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will be packed 4 million each.
The champion will win 9 million, against the finalist's 5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will enter at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
The Barça, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main, and has four assigned places.
The previous year’s champion stays with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of games played in this year’s edition.
New Rumasa Offers 61 Million Euros for 29.9% of Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday unveiled the details of the offer of buying stocks with which it seeks to acquire a ceiling of between 25% and 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that does not require you to launch a public acquisition offer (opa) for all of the securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be paid out in 10 years and that would be paid with an interest for such a postponement of 1% annually.
Yesterday the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 counselors.
The Jerez group gives shareholders a 15-day deadline to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, despite the Ruiz Mateos company claiming that it had contacted the regulator.
If done, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his address.
In an attempt to stay out of potential purchase offers and the vacillation of his former executives, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, he announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will be directly dependent on the group chairman.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to companies of the Salazars.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that in the coming months Sos will unveil new deviations of funds.
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former counselors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared in the National Audience that they approved the deflection of 212 million without knowing their destination.
The CNMV authorizes the opa of exclusion of Paternina presented by Investor Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the opa of exclusion presented by Investora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation by considering that its terms are in accordance with existing rules and considering the content of the explanatory prospectus submitted following the amendments made on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which he has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New tools for peripheral cars
In these days of temporary and accidents, not only car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No sin is the same, and the calculation of part costs and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Manually calculate the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service and solutions providers for claim assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information supplied by manufacturers, then developing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading firm; 80% of the ratings are made with their products.
The other firms that compete in the field of appraisal and reporting tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is far from easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Commercial Director of Audatex, in Spain, they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them supplies the information in different formats.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that more versions, variants and engines have been released in the last five years than in the previous fifteen.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very hard work, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter their price.
In addition, from each model a "smart" graphic image is made where different parts of tourism can be "pinched".
If it’s a massive sales model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If you are a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that runs, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the documentation work and the development of the databases, Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million annually in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most frequent use is focused on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for managing scrap parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that reports on the value of used in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support they can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the star product AudaPlus, the standard claim assessment solution, intended for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy commercial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint bars.
This tool is paid depending on use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which conducts thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass is focused on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows bidding for vehicles declared total disaster.
Their statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analysis or knowing deviations by brands or models.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a particular brand have passed through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious disasters in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or official manufacturer prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, damage or car maintenance.
The Gt Ratings Guide is your historic reference product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has grown at a rate of 20% annually over the past three years, and in 2008 it rose to 10.8 million euros.
Earlier last year they began their internationalization process, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38%, in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The global revenue of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country the company will earn 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion in stock markets, and now its shares are quoted for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Internet auction of accidented cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars such as motorcycles or special vehicles.
The transaction represented a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scraps and professional sellers who must register before starting to carry out operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered vendors and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and around 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market each day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose frame number has been disabled cannot be re-circulated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Historically valuable cars can be unsubscribed even if they have been unsubscribed after some harsh operations.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Workshop tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating a quote and generating a quote.
Ease of use is an essential conditioner for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, that to a greater or lesser extent they are more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 off-roads, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, it requires a computer with an internet connection to use it.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphical image of the model in question appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a rating tool like AudaPlus, but rather a catalogue of references.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented one does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
The company Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside face.
