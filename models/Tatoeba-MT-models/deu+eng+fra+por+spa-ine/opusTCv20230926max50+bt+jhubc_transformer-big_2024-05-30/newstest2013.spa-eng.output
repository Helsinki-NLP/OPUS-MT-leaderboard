A Republican strategy to hinder Obama’s re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and states that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And on that same line a majority of U.S. governments enacted, starting in 2009, new laws that hindered the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 election, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Consequently, in 2011, 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
New electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with a photograph, in addition to a proof of American citizenship.
Moreover, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the vote and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with a criminal background.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present an identity card with photography.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
For this reason, the Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with photography.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity card with these characteristics.
But often obtaining the required identity card costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo-issued ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by those clubs.
Before 2004 no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers supported certain laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on the same day of polls in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create an aid service for voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 have resulted in a decrease in the registration rate for new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted laws in five other states that favored reducing the pre-voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanic people, the same thing happened.
These represent only 11% of the voters, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, which make up 76% of the electorate, make up no more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
It was possible, in part, to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity card with photography.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that they aim to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the scale of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will in part undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Do you get the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test presents, at times, incorrect results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is a more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant on their own, doubt whether or not screening should be done.
Doing the test or not?
We have asked two experts for advice.
Studies in the United States detected a high rate of infection among sample groups, making it difficult to interpret that data and make strong recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who did not.
The study, with follow-up at the age of 12, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of suffering metastases if the screening test has not been performed.
Therefore, I recommend testing from 50 years of age, or from 40 years of age if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk rate.
The key is to make a good decision once cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of their cancer. They should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat long-term prostate cancers, in which case they should rather opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since cancer is not aggressive or poses a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We are increasingly determining precise criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend doing the test in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether or not to take the test.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous prescription for preventing cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of illness.
We estimate that if everyone eats well and moves well enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assessed that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” spokesman André Beaulieu said.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after you quit smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
Increase the risks of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
“Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer,” they add.
Feeding
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale up the risks of colorectal cancer.
Carbohydrate products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can damage the body’s cells and lead to cancer development,” they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the moment his investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While one observed a decrease in risks of prostate cancer, another observed rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly determined either.
On the other hand, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking about the concerns and family history of each person with his doctor.
"Doing the screening does not cause cancer."
The Higgs Boson in Detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a huge shock last summer, and rightly.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And moreover, it is the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But to the physicists it is not entirely clear that this is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it resembles a lot the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, new data revealed this week at a major physics conference held in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data still lacking to be completely secure.
Anyway, we assume that this is Higgs, because the chances of mistaking seem little. We will see what it is about.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to violate that rule and do not try too much, because it will end up hurting itself.
Although the physics of particles is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we encounter the good citizens called Fermiones, who wisely obey Pauli’s beginning.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories which, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we will not talk here, and the "particles of force", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, I should emphasize here, are not the exotic beasts we could believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or "light particle" that acts as the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (from light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force carrier" bosons.
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, it requires extremely high energies, a bit as if it were an ice pond in which only a thick rock could slide through the surface.
Therefore, it takes an immense particle accelerator such as that of CERN (the great hadron collider is a 27-km-circumference ring!) to reach such energy levels.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself glued to the door of a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what can all these investigations “contribute?” asks Ms. Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between observations and MS predictions.
Many, for their part, fervently wish that they meet, as the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Impacts
The repercussions of such investigations in our day-to-day lives are difficult to predict, but we don’t think we’re mistaken in saying it won’t have any.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would bring about.
They encountered scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, initially the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
And in addition, the applications can also proceed from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light collector in 1969 in the course of his optical research.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this pick-up now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That doesn’t mean, of course, that LHC’s activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In its Death in Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon as a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year break.
"I had been given five years of life, but I have already been seven," he says, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has caused her harm: an enormous weakness that prevents her from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned to help him eat.
Brave, even smiling, talking to strangers who devote attention to him, bringing him medicines and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for diarrhea to be cured, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found remedy for that evil.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man pisses on his feet,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care centre have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Mrs. A., 89, is to die "consciously and drowned."
But the disease has made her children discover.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I no longer have any wishes in this life,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the coming days, she expects a last visit from her son who lives in Italy.
At Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid is offered.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It’s very little, since we know that we’ll all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the center’s doctors.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
A dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand.
Diabetics no longer control their sugar level.
Death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died overnight.
This morning, his son finished beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
In the centre of Victor-Gadbois the days pass without being equal.
Alongside a 94-year-old man who enjoys his last family meeting in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two children, after trying everything to survive.
“Since six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 with cancer,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Centre and the Grand Montréal Palliative Home Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely that large relative shortage in Quebec’s health care that causes many palliative care doctors to worry about the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliative care eminences, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to demonstrate their opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
“Recently,” she says, “I’ve seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergencies suffering great pains without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I’m afraid that patients want to die just because they don’t get proper care.”
And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Hélène Richard’s survival expectations were already low when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was so sorry that she wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who request death thank their caregivers for not meeting their demands once they have been relieved of their pain thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful when it comes to the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative home care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until his death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can’t pretend we don’t understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
Those who are not relieved say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want to be relieved.”
The realization of this report has been made possible thanks to a scholarship in journalism from Canadian health research institutes.
Large real estate scandals in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers from political parties and Italian mafia specialists tell, day after day, what they know of a formidable “system”, of which the construction industry is part, officials, politicians, unionists and mafiaists.
A "industry" that went too expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system pulverizes once we’ve hunted the big media,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible thanks to a thorough investigation into malversations linked to road contracts in Quebec, which Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest at the time had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transportation would have saved $1 billion in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to stay with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the existing stratagems behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government stakeholders, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the "Marteau squad" police, who, since 2009, have made Montreal's "sewery cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to the serial record of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal officers such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been packed in exchange for public procurement.
Montreal road network engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public procurement.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money to the right and sinister during the 2000s, awarding more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, mainly to the Liberals in power.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
In ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewer contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other officials in the road network have admitted they received money for inflating bills between 30% and 40% in terms of fake extras.
In addition, a mayor’s party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately blinding a parallel budget and filling his cash box with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to a huge crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politics in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she has since 2010 opposed the sale of a municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to real estate developers in full boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money.
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, she says she pulls "from a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
And he adds that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning up the wounds but it would take a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that doubtful practices do not repeat.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is mostly worried about the role of the "elected politicians in the stream of the stratagema."
Estimating 70% of the share of dirty money that was destined for funding election campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: “I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but that will not change the donation, he says, “as long as election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He advocates a complete review of the system of public procurement and party financing: “We cannot fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws.”
If this story blows the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
PSG is not FC Barcelona!
This season he has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Advance from day to day by your side.
The technical staff also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything is going very fast in football.
But I don't get hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training center to my passing through Saint-Etienne, I have always moved forward with huge steps.
You're going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti contributes a lot to me in terms of my positioning.
It’s backed by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the equipment?
Yeah, of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like that in Liga 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think other titles will be won in Paris.
In January, I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The trust he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away the position of leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the eighths of the final with style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league against Porto so that we can get the turn of eighths of the final.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a major European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
For now, that’s not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is handed over to its means to make this project concrete.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as in last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts in taking that championship title.
In the last season we didn’t get far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should have been champions.
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
I think this year will be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it away.
Do you think the media expect more from the PSG?
It’s normal for them to expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have totally accepted it.
After we won Troyes 4-0 at home, still finding things to reproach is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to start a game project.
A team is built in time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for eighths in the final, and they have invested a lot too!
In view of the amounts invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that Liga 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up taking the trophy.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s successes.
It's better to say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and set a lot of goals.
He came to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he has shown in every team he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us to progress.
How did you live the 2012 Euro with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things out there and I got reinforced.
Today I manage to play good games in the team.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the "blues."
We learned from what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have an exemplary behaviour today.
What do you see from the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the "blues"?
It's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the team to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to lay the foundations?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn’t had a match like that in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a way of payment.
Bitcoin’s quotation, after reaching the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (quotes are censored on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It’s nothing impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It described bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competiting with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credits", used to advance a video game and that can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both accounting book depositaries, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed via a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are contained in the public book of accounts, which is spread throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction into that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file cutting, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "crossing" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zero at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, in order to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept one of the two transactions as valid; the other would remain orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in calculation power.
The life of the network has its ups and downs.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and stolen bitcoins in deposit.
“The fault used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money loss thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Insitit in Israel, analyzed the book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins don’t circulate.
In November, the “giant sales” were launched.
"There were $30,000 exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes quite a lot in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Their system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The carrier also manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to run in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB plans to re-evaluate the various risks, today considered high, in the event that this currency succeeds.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished mostly Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also with peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be tolerated when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the almond-planted hills thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attacks, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no inflow of Taliban in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was wrapped in fire and blood because of the fights between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of their peasants outperformed by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujahedin, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking government land to resell as land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting at the same time as huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
There will be jobs to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is eager for mobile phones. The television and its Turkish folletins presenting a modern world has great fans across the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of the Western nations; however, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the position of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, their country depends on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has reestablished its services, no reservoirs have been fixed or major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth has expanded.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned Mes Aynak’s copper mines, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the province’s leading employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which imports and exports are heavily dependent, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops departed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, sanitary and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of trying to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions match, a service of "civil and military actions" by the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
Those works, delightful of obtaining local labour, have been able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, clean water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local, very harsh living conditions in those valleys often above 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be freed from the insurgency carried out by foreign groups, something farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civil aid that reaches directly to them.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And for almost two years Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, weakening institutional stability and leading to judicial mess.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delusion" and continues to "traiting his word" and "pisting the right."
On the part of its supporters, it assures that this is a measure to quicker end the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy causes havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either you vote for my text or I keep full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, the vast majority of which are Islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt that they could not enforce their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, yesterday morning 11 people, substitute members, were added in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As you could expect, the articles voted have been unanimously voted.
The commentators are funny, on the other hand, the fact that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the clock of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still under vote yesterday late, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, subject of all views, remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the primary source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that “principles” could be replaced by “standards”, which would have allowed for more stringent enforcement.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising trick.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm his conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we look at the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could arise in the future would be to what extent the civilian judges are competent to rule above all this.”
Beyond its religious nature, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms concerning the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few in comparison to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the military’s desire, the revision of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Nor will prosecution of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
They also showed their concerns regarding the text, which they consider liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy continues and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was scheduled to go on television last night, demonstrations are planned for noon.
Supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and a pristine nature.
“AIF” identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal stack" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the filled nets.
In this same place, Jesus appeared to His disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
The believers travel here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin, "Via Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretory, where the trial was carried out, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, to the Stone of the Anointing and to the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree of which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will later come true.
Make a Vertical Journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret shelter against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to be built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, only those who devote themselves to climbing can.
The others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
Until there, from the foot of the hill bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are about 300 museums.
In one trip you won’t be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Manuscripts or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the desert of Judea, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath Al Basha, which are some rooms of former Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and swimmers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And there are the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Healthcare
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, lies at the lowest point on the planet: at 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily supports even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to pass treatment courses with salt water, brine and healing muds and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to get their broken nerves in order.
Playing the mysteries of ancient times
They preserve the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It passed the famous sea route that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the zodiac signs.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "same" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves a lot to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently 1-3$.8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is fast tram and in Haifa is the only subway line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travelling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transshipping for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday evening to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning a new working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, flakeless fish and dishes where milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on cow and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are ground chicken balls, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no street dogs.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk to their liking" in an imposing way.
In the evening you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Snookers love crowded places and don’t reject treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bicycle will get you out for 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to travel the country and rest were citizens of the US, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the UK and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeded 51% of the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: Immigrants Save for Language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue about the consequences that the law would bring on mandatory examination, scammers have already appeared in the country trading with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million immigrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law comes into force, according to which every labor immigrant must take an exam to verify his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service provision sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to complete the examination of the language, if not that of Russian history and that of the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are exceptional.
Persons who managed to obtain their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Utility, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examination centers will operate sponsored by the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Peoples Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to run for testing in all cities, with more than 160 such centers open now in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, managed to ask the press this question many times: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring for both Russians and immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
Many people are talking today about defending the rights of labor immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
Problems have immigrants without profession, education, those who don’t know the language or pass medical control.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, put him on a "paid little trip" to a creepy, narrow cow, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise them one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages," confirms Tolib Sharipov, head of the Tajikistan Immigration Service's Labour Immigration Directorate.
Don't get angry, little boss!
In the meantime, however, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write in their own language with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families even have nothing to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, clothing them and buying them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these boys venture to work at the first chance.
It’s hard, if you don’t know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, rights defenders point out an important point.
Exams will only be conducted for those immigrants whose legal status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only a thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry fake documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Umed Hushkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stubborn, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was revealed that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several “false” certificates of language knowledge have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The counterfeit documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is twice and a half more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to pass the exam successfully the first time more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is fairly low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly with respect to owners of weapons for civilian use.
This is the reaction of the government to recent incidents: Squeeze shots during wedding celebrations where luckily no victims were, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Squeeze seven people died.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for licensing to carry weapons, from 18 to 21 years old.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on gun possession will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying “hard-hand policy.”
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social shooter organizations, demand that such measures of “purely meaningless rigor” be renounced.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, Russian BBC news service lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov said.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 firearms-related crimes were committed during six months of 2012, compared to a total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be a drawback for the offender to turn to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stated that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons was under control.
Suppliers: From factories to officials
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Víctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts gun orders
The first, "army or military weaponry", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the same Caucasians,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes the stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
The illegal weapons are on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were caused deliberately to cover the fault," said a former military officer.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also lay their sand granite.
“They have now proliferated private weapons factories that are not competitive on the international market and distribute weapons in string to the black market, including that in Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” the former military said.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these illegal weapons supply sources to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Planning of Public Management.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and publicly accessible portal data that revolved around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market’s weapons have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there is armed conflict, 14% of cases are stolen during arms production and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology."
The arms store owner, who asked his surname not to be mentioned, says the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a shipping.
Through some clerk, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the registry and pass it over the fence.
"He brings the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he said.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when we have to comply with the crime discovery plan, they make proof purchases from illegal weapons traders,” he added.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
“I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed me to go to the Begovaya platform, where a man would be taking me to a ‘skinny’ where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I heard only there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store dependent. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
There are sellers in the markets, but you have to get there too, say "on the part of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel handcuffs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to deal with him.
Novices are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets was tested as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was prepared to publish an article on this topic.
The schemes, according to his words, have not changed.
He was given a photo album where there wasn’t “everything.”
“I felt like in a luxury boutique,” the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranets, does not offer cat for hare: everything there can be tasted.
I, as a prospect, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the title of the advertisement “Buy a gun or a machine gun.”
There users place their orders and ask questions.
Do they sell to minors?
"No permission, of course," asks the user "Iván" (preserved spelling).
"I buy TT gun. Moscow", laconically asks your question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish, to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia.
Ex-military and military commentator Viktor Baranets
I’ve heard of these systems: Usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send him a photo and instructions so that he knows where the gun is hidden," reports NGO press secretary "The Right to Weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is placed, one goes out of a weapon and puts him in jail.

Makarov for $100
On the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to weapons", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
It should be waiting a month and a half.
It is sent from military warehouses by middle rank chiefs.
According to official statistics from the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7 per cent, accounting for 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against the low wages paid in Walmart’s supermarkets and restaurants in popular fast food chains such as “McDonald’s”, “Burger King”, “Taco Bell”, “Wendy’s” and “Kentucky Fried Chicken.”
For now, no one dares assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is meant to lose strength and to relent in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages received by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the aim of protest organizers is to create labor unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has virtually not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", which in the United States began the discount orgy that captured millions of inhabitants, and which was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
That day, some workers at the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and leftist activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products target modest and moderate income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and product assortment have made Walmart one of America’s largest corporations.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, partly because it pays little to its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" demonstrators demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 per hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on consumers’ shoulders, each visit to the store will result in only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are pleased that the protest took place in only nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. Thursday evening until midnight the next day and during that time, Walmart sold around 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left their job "less than five" Walmart employees and that the protest had been just "another public relations trick" organized by the labor union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the Walmart stores (which in this progressive city are not appreciated, and so for now there is none), but the McDonald’s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, according to federal and New York laws, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money is something incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers went through the McDonald’s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble in some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a Wall Street Journal forum there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if they don’t know what to feed them on.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday morning at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 per hour, i.e. that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be established in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing them from doing so and from punishing trade union activists with arguments and layoffs.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main is excessive staff rotation.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the McDonald's rally near Times Square, in which several local Democratic politicians participated, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of portions, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received the support of other prominent Democrats in New York City, such as City Mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support fast food workers to achieve fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times described, this has been the biggest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, which works tens of thousands of people from New York.
It is still unclear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
“For now, fooling the brain isn’t that easy.”
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, is lately perceived normally mainly through the special glasses prism.
Earlier this summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it was clarified that for the company’s scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of study of your research group?
- We devote ourselves to the person-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its large mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with a finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future owe us?
Although Kinect has brought the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design technologies.
The world of computing must be freed to ours, to the physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space surrounding him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, hell with those foolish virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don’t you think they overestimate it?
- Of course it cannot be considered a panacea, it remains pending to resolve the question of privacy, since it is not always wanted that others learn about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not loose, but shorter movements.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- What's that like?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this can of soda?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Normally I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's going to be very difficult to recognize.
- I mean, do you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think in the near future we will have to work primarily on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and current 30fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made an adjustable processing delay contact sensor from 1 to 100 ms and it should be noted that the modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human-machine interaction.
To me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the pictures per second are more.
Isn’t it necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible slide sensor.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn’t presented its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to the smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is their strength (private things will only you be able to see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibility to these "in-air" images. For example, the interference of various ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone was blowing it in the fins of the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he seems to feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to struggle with for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believes that he is going to an open, almost endless space. We are also working on the idea of running ribbons (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, fooling the brain isn’t that easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes the work with virtual reality attractive for researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Avanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens standing ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of St. Petersburg’s art and scene, whose achievements go beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without even Russia knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed up and down in red, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are displayed.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophy tale writers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the avant-garde of St. Petersburg from the late 1980s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organiller and became the organiller of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, by his Bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why do you go around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red color is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray arouses aggressiveness and unrest of good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
When did you realize that you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the subsequent ones exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I plunged into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
It was important for me to find myself at the St. Petersburg Cultural Center, where the best creative minds were to be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Bohemian Saint Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's Ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was currently fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the days of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of her great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our regular employees and customers.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was made in the press, the award was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our time it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go apart. One can be popular but very unculted.
- There's something recognizable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them it is clearly expressed the current and occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are an everlasting category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything is bathed and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change of clothing.
Now one follows him through the clothes, orienting themselves outwardly, but not inside the person.
And perhaps that person shouldn’t be held in hand, but spit in his face.
And deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- We saw you recently in the role of urban organizer. - A cult town must have such a hero.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have tact.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before the people were grouped into herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the Simplones wanted another.
Now everyone has been divided into microcommunities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a 100-dollar banknote for everyone to like.
Now you have to think who you want to like.
Now, each cult hero has its 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything fades.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to spoil what you have achieved.
When he was young he made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denying money just to paint paintings.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is one concept: the official of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right ones everything was different, the kings perhaps did not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to correctly assess them and pave their way.
The subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is ground.
But on our stones it is hard for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people curious who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is insignificant.
We have to make art fashionable, as it did at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a St. Petersburg grant.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or shock with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with humans on board depart in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is asked: How to continue the species in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says Chief Researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at large altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Reproductive problems in space with flora were started to be addressed.
Half a century ago, experiments with plants were conducted.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were not different from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophiles.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of inweight.
We get a normal chicken as a result.
But then the problems start.
“The problem is that this chick has to find support, stand on his own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) at the Russian Academy of Sciences.
As they didn’t find support, the chicks randomly flipped.
And after 10 hours in newborns a total atrophy of instincts was given.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the unfortunate thing was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we got the chicks to be born, but then we left them because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only same-sex species will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely on biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an adequate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our flying turkey, and no one on Earth could say, if it's after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says aerospace industry veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a child.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, we count the astronauts to whom after long flights everything has worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even on orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new pathways in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The Cosmonaut Preparation Center’s hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero floatability, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, although still hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its native element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the time of birth to the time of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, a swimming monitor for newborns.
In short, if inweight is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation, the force of gravity is necessary.
In inweight, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepit very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, relying on the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, this will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear a special workout suit, like adults.
He will be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled, a completely inadapted person,” predicts Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee at the Institute of Biomedical Problems at the Russian Academy of Sciences.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when the human beings on their ships head to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space.
NKÚ Chief: Inspection of the "švarc" system has not met with the guilty politician
In the field of public awards, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is soft.
Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Office of Supreme Control (NKÚ), said this in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," so describes the current situation.
The joint controls of Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDG (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother entrepreneurs with inspectors. So is it prohibited or allowed?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case neither the president of the government can hinder the action of the office that has an obligation to carry out such checks or require obligations,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the control committee at the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint draft between the Czech and the German team, in which the legislation concerning public awards in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we began to carry out about two years ago.
Simplified: European legislation regulates how public awards should be organized; this follows the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have all joined together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "stricter and more complete", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think are the conclusions?
It is precisely a common control of this kind that could help us stop investing efforts in the implementation of laws, reducing and improving limits, even though this does not have such a positive impact.
Savings economy means getting an adequate thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not because we reduce the limit of tenders means that we are going to achieve this.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paper" that those who want to search for system failures will be able to do it more easily than if the limits remained as high as now.
You talk about the problems of our country with the transfer of the legislation that regulates the practice of public awards.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized otherwise?
As far as offices, such as the NKU, there acts the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a college as well, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallelly.
Also competences are to some extent analogous, however, as Germany has a federal organization, the courts of accounts are even at this level. In this aspect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, what we here call state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without concrete data, but Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be precisely specified what is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
Surely not, but, I repeat, I don’t like making such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must deal with a large number of problems.
If it weren't, they wouldn't have any benefit to collaborate with our office, don't you think?
As for our country's legislation, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean for your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been manifested in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex post checks, a certain delay is needed.
For now, we see in the process of preparing future controls: we have launched a new "non-economic risk detection" tool, through which we have passed nearly 14,000 public tenders, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are corrected and the like.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be beneficial or rather a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that can arise is that the regulation "shall be hardened" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional regional council operational programmes), and every non-compliance with laws on public awards meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to harden the law in this way?
I don't think it's this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal decision, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only be able to create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this started path leads us.
The Prime Minister recently declared that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the "švarc" system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way, and if it prohibits anything, then even the Prime Minister of the government cannot prevent the action of the Office which is obliged to carry out such checks and impose obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and we allow it," but you can't say that we're going to pretend nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the regulations are quite strict as to how it should be acted formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for failing to meet formal demands.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. That is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice sheets, although most of them are transitable.
In various parts of the Czech Republic the roads feature ice and snow plates.
Although most pathways are transitable, in some cases caution should be exceeded.
Karlovy Vary Region
Today in the morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but featured ice and snow plates.
The temperature falls and will range between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the lower areas the snow layer is thin.
Instead, on the ridges of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor because of the fog, according to information from the regional road operations control center.
The R6 highway and top-notch highway in the region are now unrestricted.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, in some of them there are still sections with ice remains and pebble snow.
Attention on the road needs to be increased, especially in the highest areas.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové Region
In some roads in eastern Bohemia there is danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have formed on the roads, reports the Directorate of Highways and Highways in its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of forming ice sheets, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third-class roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains from Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a pebble snow layer in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of East Bohemia, the sky will be clear and partly cloudy today, with no rainfall.
Temperatures will usually range from three below zero to one positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitable today in the morning, although caution should be extreme and it will be necessary to adapt to the weather.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frost, temperatures will range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent temperature drop, some pathways could also be ice-covered.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will progressively improve.
This is what comes from the information from the region’s road operations control center.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although it is recommended to be extreme caution, especially on the lane between kilometers 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany there may be sections with ice sheets.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case it is also warned of ice-plated sections.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less trafficked tracks in the Šumava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators removed snow overnight; on the Šumper road some three centimeters of snow were accumulated, according to the track managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are accessible without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, snow remains.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will encounter medium snow waste in the direction of Jeseník,” a road administration operator from Šumper to ČTK confirmed today.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to the Jesenická and, after chemical treatment, the tracks of the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are transitable without restrictions, in that of Šternberská drivers should drive with caution on the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem Region and Liberec Region
North Bohemian road operators have reported complications in various sections early in the morning.
Aside from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the roadway; instead, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
For the time being, no service complications have been recorded.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surroundings of Štětí.
During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and ice will be overcast.
Unfavorable conditions have been announced from the general roads on the I/13 road, at the border between the Ústí nad Labem and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched over the track with the weight of snow.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in just under a month the end of the world is coming, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other alarming news we like to catch.
The music group The Tap Tap rather likes to joke about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
Also, in December you are organizing a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain it to our readers?
This is a state-run act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar set out for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, on 20 December at 9 p.m., we will organise 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled “End of the world, cancelled.”
Currently it’s very popular on YouTube, can it be heard at charitable concerts?
Of course, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All performers will sing it at the same time at all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where Xindl X...
How did this collaboration emerge?
We work together even with other personalities from the Czech cultural scene, besides organizing many charitable events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised at the concerts against the end of the world be for?
Equipment for the Studeo educational centre without barriers, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
Students of the Jedličkův ústav school regularly receive the visit of teachers with whom they perform fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough financial means to pay the teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning on another similar "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage of being in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
What is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, until now, we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which keeps me surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned from, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to exits abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still uncommon for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there is not.
Fortunately, a civilian association has been created that strives to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what aspects should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with severe disabilities to travel on their own in public and can go to service, to the museum, wherever they want to go.
But it’s not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap Let’s go a bit ahead!
A respectful or barrierless society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will begin to change everything.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered Jedličkův Ústav as an educator, where there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a coworker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we got a bit off our hands (laughs).
However, popularity hasn’t come until recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us a lot to connect with famous singers and also actively work to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the aid of the European Union, we can also afford teachers in quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to go so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that something could be done otherwise.
The world of the show is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is accepted with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare to say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction.
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, on the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it’s not just a breakthrough for them, but for the whole society.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss help, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they learn that they have to go to rehearsal for two days, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people come in and out, you can’t avoid it.
Whoever has will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21:00
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will take part in 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through videoconference to jointly sing The Tap Tap group's song "End of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources needed to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO educational centre without barriers in Jedličkův ústav of Prague, which costs 25 million Czech krones.
Entrance to the concert costs CZK 400 and children up to 12 years have free entry at the Bohemian early ticket option
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intense collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency’s project commission.
However, Poland’s path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the conference by A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent, and years later Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Award for their "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a major driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name on one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a drain was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is unknown who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are not known either.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for starting the dresin or for its braking.
Information about this dresine is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
In 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes clear that the investigation has reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the specialized press appeared the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, society is first referenced with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronomy.
In one of them, by Professor M. Subotowicze, it was proposed to create a society that would devote itself to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautic Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautic Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He served in this position until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) probe rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a peak of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg of weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial testing of the two-stage RM-2 rockets began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind of height.
In 1962, however, work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differentiated from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial testing began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Subsequently the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the research of cosmic space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the social labour law is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the law on social work.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will of course be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulatory.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unrestrained financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the importation of cheap goods, attempts to shorten distances and to this end "provoks a decrease" of the price of the competitor with the aim of gaining most of the market and thus increasing its profit margin.
On a large scale, for most entrepreneurs, it means moving production abroad, buying cheaper there or disappearing, resulting in high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour is higher compared to other economies.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and therefore is not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
This whole situation encourages the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their desire to obtain profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of those countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is evident in particular in the changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees as regards labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing differences between poor and rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid reaches a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, a rather frequent case occurs: employees with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
Such a scandal was made public related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
Savings from virtually all southern EU states lead, without a doubt, to the same situation: people, pressured by a steep decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to miserably live on the limits of society, hoping that one day they will arrive in the private investing capital country.
Is it necessary to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a small part of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media affirm to the satiety that the state should not bring capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by interfering in control.
Then it is necessary to wonder whether private capital does not influence its egoism on the political march and, therefore, on the whole state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the sphere of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, commission the drafting of bills to private legal companies, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power emanates not from the people, as proclaimed in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation find themselves quickly in a situation such as Appiános describes in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long been disintegrating and the administrations have been occupied by force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and helps to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption spread unimpededly and the people went to the polls with the vote paved in advance"... "there were no people with character that would aspire to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganisation, the state was eight months without consuls"... "He began to talk seriously that the only remedy for such a serious self-cratic situation was necessary."
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today’s society is based on disregarded preferences for individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not, in its essence, capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole society.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unrestrained liberalization of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, awaiting the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that today’s elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and recent history.
The suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue searching for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose stirring reads "Let's not forget how fragile we are" (let's not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children didn't want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, diverse reactions have arisen, as always.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favour of the right to self-defense and encases the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and calls Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the periodic killings and who is the victim; after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to give readers a look behind the curtain, a look to find out who takes advantage of the tensions that have been crawling for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small ground surface of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have come to on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, about who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity, the history of struggles for power is in the forefront.
In each era we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who directed their steps autonomously or whether behind his throne was someone who directed their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been reached in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
They don’t write much about them.
Yeah, of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant strengthening.
They have major shares in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, declared or is preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the Iraq attack there were five, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only four remained, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of America of the Rothschilds, began during the War of Secession to print money and was murdered in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was murdered in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their desire for world power led them during the years 1859-1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was marked as an absolute aim to eliminate the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially of Britain; and the third was intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (so much powers of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and consume not so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more).
The method with which the group of the wealthiest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and subsequent offering of a solution (order ab chao – order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, erroneous, and always lead to a worsening of the situation; otherwise, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so as not to repeat a crisis like that of 1907.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francis Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, and after the First World War was triggered, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unwarrantedly from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungary Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, covertly, a conflicting situation in the wake of the enormous war repairs imposed on Germany and represented this minority, with which the optimum function was created for the German radicalization of the impoverished masses was guilty.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds pushed for the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour statement laid the foundation for mass Jews’ immigration to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terror attacks were taking place on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know if Hitler threw too much of the rope to which the international bankers had tied him at first or if everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way the war repairs imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers managed to initiate it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a first-line victim of combat, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice bring about injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we take into account that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz, the world's only two-way.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said: “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order.”
The new world order in his imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-wealthy financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted a chip at birth that controls their whole being.
And he forced all, small and big, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two fingers in his forehead, let him add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo Movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist student demonstrators occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 graduates hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive prospect: tossing the Shah on board could not afford it, since, if it did, it jeopardized the trust of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free hostages by force.
The incarcerated diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the US, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which harvested a small hit for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated trip, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping a covert story to achieve an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined the location in the country for the shoot of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combination
The plan drawn by "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a singular combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines moods. On the one hand we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the credit sequence are shown iconic photographs of the era of events, which were plasmated in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: suited men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the office halls, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Little Goodbye, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town: City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first Affleck film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed ancient film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is "wheeling" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy takeover is impressive for its synoptic ability which, at the same time, conveys the excitement of disconcert and lack of prediction that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect on fictional scenes (the impostor team at the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here not everything comes out so elegantly (the scene in which the crisis at Tehran airport is stalking, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled quest behind its track become madness).
The weakness of Argo is the uncontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck’s film loses a bit of dramatic trace, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, appreciate its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 1970s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as a proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services may be, it is enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnikovpoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the regulations or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop".
“It happened to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent quota of women in leadership positions in major European companies,” said Právo Patrik Nacher, organizer of the survey.
Among the nominated absurds is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify male and female insurance policies.
Until now, women were advantaged by better life insurance prices because they objectively represent a lower risk.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel which as a result harms the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the guideline obscures the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
The factual ban on the use of the term "ointment butter" or the removal of the classic bulb from shops has been criticized.
A quality banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the petition, for example, that higher quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters long in the EU and could not present “abnormal curvatures.”
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this only seeks to harmonize the unhomogenized national rules to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been smoothed on the basis that the existing directive involves a waste of foodstuffs.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year’s EU prescription that in inflatable balloons that are marketed is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The U.S. referred here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the leading cause of childhood death from suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of sugar trees by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious events are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia; in order not to hurt Greece's sensitivity, we must talk about FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU has determined the maximum amounts of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for canned mushrooms, posing a substantial fine threat.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying to those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application for grants.
This kind of ideas arose not in Brussels but in Prague.
“We are at a disadvantage because we don’t have sea.
We ask for compensation from the European Union,” said the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the fall of 2004.
He argued this with the fact that a lot of cereal was produced in our country and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was prepared to assist the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU). In particular, it is intended for the drafting of Brussels grant applications.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member States’ guidelines are often criticized, EU regulatory efforts and more effective operation and development across the Union deserve, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also concerned with the sensitive fiber, as is the case with other countries of the Union, the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these fights.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the name of origin of Olomouc cheese, but had to change its name to national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and was renamed "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugarcane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official EU list of protected denominations of origin, along with feta and gorgonzola cheeses known worldwide, the marshmallow of the German city of Lübeck or the ham of Parma, are already found for example the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Pohořelice and Třeboň and, even, the variety of lú
As protected maras of the EU, you can be proud of the ginger bread of Pardubice and the boats of Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up for the presidential election?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If it were all right in our country, then I wouldn't submit my candidacy.
But I can no longer stand to see how robbery has been done in our country over the last twenty years, how thieves are left unpunished, taxes are increased and retirement age are increased.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I am forty years old and my candidature is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon afterwards it is on its way to the presidency.
Isn’t he turning his back to those who voted?
I have always said that my candidature for the presidency depends on the results of the Senate election.
I later stated that if I was elected a senator, I would run for the presidency.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest mandate as possible.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but we trample anyone who wants to initiate a change.
This is added by the media, which disregards you and confuses freedom of expression with freedom to lie.
I am said to have bribed journalists or served as a adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property over twenty million.
To do this, the law must be changed.
As president it does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a lobbying group for the guideship to be recognized as self-employed, and we have achieved it.
The problem lies in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to get the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without encroachments or party dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing or left-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more leftist.
It doesn’t matter to me, either a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we go ahead.
I don’t care if someone is right or left, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KSČM or the SDG, and I will likewise be against bad ideas.
He jokes when he says he’s populist.
But isn't he demonstrating it with what he says?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get closer to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world or well-known experts speak of them.
But without the support of the parliament there are only slogans left.
And so he can’t survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will, for example, get criminal and financial liability?
I have no choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve this.
If he was elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask parliamentary party leaders to legitimize criminal and financial liability for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong character pointing out the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time, I'm just an amateur, I'm not a genius or an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I just started in politics and try to get as much support as possible for my program.
I'm trying to get things forward myself, but in case it doesn't work out, I'll leave it in six years and go back to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I do nothing with one person, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they may be encouraged to submit their candidature to the Senate.
I went to Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light fraud with light heating oils.
I presented myself starting from the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did, voted on the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two from the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the impeccable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money either.
I have no money for the presidency campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have money?
It's talking about property statements, how's yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of works of art valued at ten million, an Aston Martin valued at about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was galant with women and, at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don’t have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but don't want to put too much money on your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to owe myself?
In the campaign I have already put 2.5 million.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there isn’t too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money out of my pocket.
The campaign expenses cover in essence what I will receive in terms of senator's salary.
For example, I couldn't pay my son for English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run as a candidate.
So you will continue with your business activity so you can live?
Didn't you say before that you're going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I have promised, I have partially quit my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in the spring.
People would want it to be the Samaritan to save the republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much do you earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still win.
If I was president, I would leave the business.

The architectural studio MVRDV demonstrates that true adventures are not just in the head - in the example of the library of Spijkenisse and the newly finished "mountain of books"- 2 photos
“I think the building is funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passing by the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company near the library, says: “In addition, the building is beautiful.”
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
No one goes into those old-fashioned libraries for good, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom town located at the gates of Rotterdam that barely deserves a fleeting visit, boasts the dubious honour of having risen with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute somehow to the general culture and copy the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated armed concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how policy makers decided that there was only one possibility to improve the statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architectural studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings at the same time as cynical, took the theme with his usual serenity and attended the competition presentation in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile in his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged on his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here is my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg.”
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain rises in the intended place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of house and townhouse buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second award "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
Thus, the small town without history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white façade one would rather intuit a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it is a book paradise under a cheeser.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but the real lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with their topography every step of their climbing to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to embrace with the view, the annealed brick floor and elegant headlamps unmistakably support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
As you lift your eyes, you can see the park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally the book shelves are arranged along the façade and in the center a huge dark room is opened which is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put up the classic spatial configuration and pull the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well used: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall covering, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most current architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that’s like a day, on a Friesian farm, we encounter the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in the greenhouses and fields of the Netherlands, a small-millimeter thick plastic fabric is used as a basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library, this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, until irons of four centimeters thick were obtained.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a blend of new car and sneaker.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but there you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining adequate atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge crystal pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located in the transverse direction of the glass facade serve to shade and absorb most of the rays of the sun.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is about automatic shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to put his foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, traditional Chinese medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, at the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has shut down deep.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain bond with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Even if he's just there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved all a success in that queen discipline that in specialized slang is known as "creating an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uncultivated he may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prominent role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather thick diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany indicated that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of observer state of the United Nations.
Berlin finally abstained.
- Why? - Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, due to the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don’t think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from establishing a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because at the moment he is reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to doing so.
I think they're still trying to see what their role will be, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken on the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful and not alienated from the Arab public opinion or from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn’t give it that much importance because it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions like the Palestinian vote?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic breakdown as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with this Germany has achieved some respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
Instead, the US has clearly shown itself in favor of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the U.S. and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed due to U.S. domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is obvious that the government cannot publicly defend this position.
I believe that the genuine disparity of views does not actually have the extent attributed to it.
If we look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all excited about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the stance of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but this is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a higher entity, but they must drive things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing with the euro now.
I believe that in the future Germany will take on a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European stance.
Of course this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a heavy topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take a leading role?
Or maybe you still find it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as the main actor, certain anti-German sentiments unleashes.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seeing this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude to different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The influence of the US on European politics is decreasing more and more, but the EU is not covering that gap at the moment, who is left then?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role.
Even if they don’t like it, if it finds them unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular village, it’s la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese Brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponymes do not file a lawsuit.
Even then it is unclear whether they will be given the right.
“Foreigners find it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing firm specializing in violations of protection rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens an archive in which it holds seats at the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, the cases of Pattloch are of another nature. On behalf of his customers, he struggles against the fact that the trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word originates from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan".
It refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
“It’s harmful to the business, we have to fight it,” demands Pattloch.
“The mark makes water, the monopoly position disappears and the damage that the image suffers is enormous.”
The financial losses and process costs of the affected sectors are billionaire, especially in the case of luxury iconic products.
According to data from market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros a year, China is, in size, the third largest market for luxury goods and the largest growing market.
However, to achieve the cancellation of dubious legal entries in the trademark registration is complicated and also costs a lot of money.
The processes can be prolonged for up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had passed so long that the name the lawsuit has already become a "market reality".
“If the plaintiff is bad luck, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money because the process has damaged the plagiarist’s trademark in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphical elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can still use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that largely reminded BMW; the case was addressed in court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they encountered difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the work emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed complaints has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints remain unresolved.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means that China is leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, the brand office notes.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been packed for rights.
In other words, this means that on average each entry costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting against this costs a lot of money, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacturing of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
“We have caused this situation ourselves because in Germany surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the Munich’s appeal.
In the next two instances Freudenberg was given the right, but the opposite side continues to fight today.
We have to be very careful
The case has now reached the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where it remains pending a resolution.
Wentzler is confident that he will be able to settle the issue favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review files up to 100 years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "six-digit sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly deal, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care about,” Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe.
Specifically if the imitators are assured the rights to unprotected trademarks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long been leaving this commercial area, but has managed to prevent registration.
“We have to be very careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and attorney Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely prudent in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what has to be done is to “register everything that can be protected in China as well,” as Wentzler notes.
Otherwise, the subject may be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the contrary party license rights by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, singing, helping
In Heidelberg Imbongi choir rehearsal and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a bond capable of surpassing much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and mocasines look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then begin the voices of the singers to rise slowly (contralto, bass, tenor, and soprano), roaring, stunning, and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost get out of his boxes by trying to put order with his energetic and gentle gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers, between the ages of 23 and 69, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program, there are approximately 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month a child can be sponsored.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "narrator of stories" or "panegirist".
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this Bantu language, but singing do know.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this gentle foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At a distance of 8,733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a town called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s inhabitants are carrying the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at age 30 has become usual.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this tiny population, but what they saw mostly were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the chances in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first, it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day, all for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association that has since professionally dealt with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among bacterial-original STDs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Ticks and scabies are among parasitic transmitted STDs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur more often in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute argues that at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
For heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (mushroom) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively scarce; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has continued to fall since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were recorded in 2011.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, discomfort when urinating, discharge, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but do not offer 100% protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change your sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir charges for its performances throughout Germany, they come to raise a lot of money.
“In total we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says proud Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman confident in herself and with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It takes care of orphans finding a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as the elderly women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offering them a roof to live in and taking care of the children going to school every day punctually and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two chickenhouses and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, managed to make many of the villagers undergo HIV testing.
This is not obvious, since, despite how obvious this disease is throughout the country, it is not often spoken openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent and excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
This unaccepted form of life is largely responsible for the spread so rapidly that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless temporary people who travel the country from one side to another and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "at any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years in southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost extreme of the African continent still remember from the era of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but it has also managed to pull out a couple of tears to some other angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small village barely appears on the maps, in the Ezulweni River valley it is well known.
“Come close to Esitjeni, there shines the light,” the local people say.
And after travelling the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsals on Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice in Mercury
Messenger has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice sheet is likely to have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by three studies published Thursday in the specialized journal Science.
The Messenger probe reportedly found evidence that an ice sheet has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It seems that it is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that collided with Mercury.
No one relates the ice finding to the possibility of life on the planet, says Messenger chief investigator Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Totally unnoticed for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immenseness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, Ceres is not a “planet.”
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the older stars are shown as blue dots, although the hardest to recognize is the pink color of the "new born" stars.
This star-forming region, unromanticly named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This thunderstorm image of an extinct star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the enormous Triphid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleyades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope colors can be seen better.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has given it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photography and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
The star was captured in all its splendor for the first time by the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the greatest unknowns in astronomy.
It’s probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared untraced 4.5 billion years ago.

Depending on the shades, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Tripid Nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambole: 400 million light-years from Earth the nuclei of two melting galaxies swing toward each other to end up colliding irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it by the nickname of Southern Mill.
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is composed of dust particles whose size is ten to one hundred times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a moment as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, also continuously emerge new stars; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe mostly hydrogen could be found.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer have become more and more deep.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
It allows us to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed lifting angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the radio telescope of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer by providing processing capabilities.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of how it would be.
However, the most important information from the cosmos comes from the hands of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 he sends images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers start from the basis that there is also ice at Mercury’s South Pole.
However, there is no accurate evidence, since the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the North Pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now sure that it is.

The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great noise through the sinuous road that passes next to wooded hills, high-flowing rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that you are in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a town that is not known much, apart from that they perfectly dominate the Persian and the Azerbaijani and are very long-standing.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive architecture designed in the Soviet era and does not seem to fit entirely into such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban hubs, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this iconic region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the World’s Oldest People,” says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the lives of eight dozen local talyshis who have passed the age of 100 years. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
His son died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is sheep shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies it.
And if we take into account that the oldest man documented lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. It appears that he still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Has Shirali Müslümov then been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of this Central Asian resident’s advanced age.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan, very old people also live," Scholz says, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there is no civil record either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a surprisingly frequent fact that the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the Talishis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it doesn’t seem logical that precisely the calorie-rich diet of talyshis, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink daily a glass of melted butter, is so healthy.
Or perhaps it is the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At the age of 97, he is relatively young for what is stretched by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it tirelessly moves a huge butter tub.
Eight people live under a roof, among them one of the sons and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play from one side to the other two young children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that they serve in a typical glasses with a bubbled shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and are perfectly aligned and under the scarf hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that his son discovers we proudly.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, so I’ve never fallen and kept my color.
"I have never used a shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I have never gone to a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II period.
However, everything came back to its way when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyev, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the worship of the nation’s paternal figure, which rules its country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he gave the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s son is right: “In our culture, the elderly are highly respected.”
They live in a large family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn’t enough reason to stay alive for many years...
In the Constitution the words "Human Rights" are missing.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division in which the country is plunged.
The future constitution, with Sharia as its basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in patheticism.
“We have to overcome the transition.
And that this happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially to Christian Coptics, Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
All of them, plunged without remedy so far in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile banks for the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily nullify the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand its powers "in order to save the revolution."
However, neither Egyptians nor the whole world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of your power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean of “principles”?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal maneuver space it brings, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: on all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the disability of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exert a severe repression of the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the State must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
It is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Clearly speaking, this is nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly states equality between men and women.
Instead, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is unclear what an offence is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "insult to people"
Is a president cartoon or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Mursi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be submitted to the Egyptians for referendum.
“The revolution has returned”
For weeks, the opposition has been closing lines against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir del Cario square and swore to make the Act fail before it could come into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” says Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be “in the trash bin of history.”
He accused Mursi’s followers of wanting to lead a “coup against democracy.”
“When the referendum is convened, we will go to his palace and overthrow it,” said Jasser Said.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned,” opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifestation, perhaps not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in the cry: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They called for Mursi to “clean the country,” while proclaiming, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir square, where everything began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is obvious that Mursi’s supporters did not want to risk something like this.
The Muslim brothers stated that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loudly and clearly.
Now the time would have come to let the people decide in the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has the majority guaranteed.
“The expression ‘Human Rights’ doesn’t even appear.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process that should actually have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper 'Welt am Sonntag'.
The extension of Mursi’s powers to the three powers of the state caused this attorney to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of democratic play and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda said.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the Nile banks with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You are conceiving a monster that you cannot control.”
Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success has any relationship with its greed for a highly smelling fish?
Take a series of excessively healed cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
Then you can smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s exquisites.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water for up to a year, depending on how stinky you prefer.
As it gets dark and colder, the Norwegians come in tropel to a festival that is held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this delicacy of most, so to speak, captivating.
"You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small buckets and drinking from a drink large amounts of the beverage.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not very different than a serving of sushi that has traveled a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, in which poverty whipped Norway and in which, before refrigeration, fish were kept during the autumn immersed in water and salt in sealed barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated primarily to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even makes it not much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, though fairly smelling, of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, it’s all expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the crazy 10€ ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 incident."
Norwegians are very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be able to commit such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she goes through rakfisk trays and that, with her long blonde blonde and amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise people.”
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
“We don’t like to boast, we don’t like ostentation.”
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone wasting money they didn’t have during the years leading up to the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with an unwrapped unwrapped.
I'm in the snow tailing for something to eat; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now an alce burger is definitely something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, that smell of fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many locals where a rakfisk dinner is held where guests vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nose pits most.
A television has connected live with a host who carries a little bird and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision competition.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe they're the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
While Mexico’s incoming President, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take over his position, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially poor today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel enclosure has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already taken about 60,000 lives in six years.
“My administration has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before he joined the U.S. President, Mr. Peña’s previous political experience was as governor of his native state, that of Mexico.
A very populated and rapidly growing state that surrounds the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute the merit of the growth of tourism on site and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked roads and filled with bumps that were rehabilitated.
Plates with their name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern sports car and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he will achieve real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
“Especially, as far as security and economics are concerned, we expect the interesting and true change that our country so much needs.”
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was unbanned by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition’s lack of essence of the new president.
"He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that a lot of people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under high highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to intervene to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
On a desert plot next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a rate much higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, that he was unable to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critics accuse their administration of making their eyes fat.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the incident, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
"When I came home, it looked like her body was cleaned," Mrs. Buendía recalls.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
As his mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross that reads a single word: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says has been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I was an old gossip, an unrest, a complaint.
What they want is that you simply accept what they say and that you shut up.”
“But that can’t be so when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
“I hope he’s the same type of president he was when he was governor,” says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not denounce ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning's abuse allegations during his stay in prison
Trial focuses on Manning's period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the basis that Manning's imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while in military detention.
During the prosecutor’s interrogation of Manning at a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney Commander Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits of unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which was carried out during a hearing conducted following the defence’s request that the case be dismissed since his imprisonment had been harsh and that this had already entailed sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while he was detained.
The army’s intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on service in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled in after Manning's visits during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officials would have asked Manning questions and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had qualified the treatment given by the cellers as “excellent” and the treatment received at the facilities in general as “very professional.”
The forms show no report of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern on some issues and that the officers who visited him had spoken of those issues and had indicated to him that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the record.
"They wrote 'without incidents' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why she had not reported the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council in charge of examining suicide intentions she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said they had put him under that restrictive regime, which is a degree below that of possible suicide surveillance, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the chief executive to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... to be able to enjoy what, in my view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison located at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and once lost consciousness due to heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning explained Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some slippers, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light from the outside pointing to his eyes while he was asleep.
He said that if the cellers couldn’t see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
In January 2011, Manning’s attorney filed a formal complaint regarding the treatment he received.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday’s statement, according to which, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the jailers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the counting.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced by the cellier's order that he should drop the blanket with which he could have been covered, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his slippers to injure himself but that he had not.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, slippers and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he had during his stay in prison and drastically reduce his sentence in case he was convicted in the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it intends to make Manning guilty of minor crimes and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of application to all detainees who are in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leakage of national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If he is found guilty of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; they say they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely gone down the esplanade and arrived in the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some signs indicated the path to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where to go.
Having grown up in Central California, I have been called "Mexican" throughout my life.
This is ethnic tachygraphy, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as “Irish” or my New York friends refer to themselves as “Italians.”
I later decided to be "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, tactigraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was just an American.
I speak Spanish. Well enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought of that time this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, it was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why a Mexican is now so likely to stay in Mexico as to venture to go to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a trade block in North America in the style of the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to give up half of their territory on a gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think of centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that leads to the least criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping their neighbors’ sovereignty.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand at the feet of war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is the one they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that somewhere in our family tree, there was a person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, to whom the door of opportunities in Mexico was closed and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fitted into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight that what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is clear.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulders as if we were from a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first ones know more solidly who they are and the second ones bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel that they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to make things even more complicated, so I learned during my journey, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised “ambassadors” of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
That's not going to happen.
There's too much resentment.
And with wage inequality, crowded corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be alone with this idea, guys.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resented by how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who began first, piles of buildings have been destroyed; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles coming from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything pieced apart whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional turmoil.
Perhaps this will make your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that his lethal deadly situation could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems to be very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week’s clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite Gaza being beaten well.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders might conclude that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renewed regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the wealthiest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Exultant Hamas members say the Islamist half-moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbullah militia party dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, until they reach Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have too much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brothers are Hamas cousins and their leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in their place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for starting the last wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has thrived, especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has widely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of an aspiring territory to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to rise despite international law being illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on January 22, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good hit if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing is imposed, although the Arab Spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the area’s superpower will hardly help new Arab governments improve their economies.
That pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dust that will one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics worsen the situation as the Arab population increases.
Cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one that wise people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to other people who are struggling for this cause.
Egypt, which must start stopping the entry of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the matter should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also plays an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to devote his attention to him.
This attitude is a deplorable vision for the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
General tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with illnesses look on green off cartons, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneering the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with a wrap of an olive green off, awesome images of parts of the body with illnesses and representations of children and babies sick for being children of smoking parents.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed on a small type of font.
It is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia claims that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by removing the traits that make this habit glamour.
Rely on studies that show that if a person hasn’t started smoking before age 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
“You can see that boys, even from an early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls linked the crown logo with the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black market for tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will carry serious involuntary consequences,” Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia said.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited after the law has been passed.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, claimed the demand for silicone pitchers and covers to cover the nasty images of the boxes had been fired almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a recusation to the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stocks.
“It’s a good deal for us.”
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social media among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most vendors not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone on to be done online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local companies and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
“If you market tobacco and only have this small window left to promote your products, online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in reviews of brands coming from “walking citizens” posted on social media websites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One might ask if this is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigars and has taken the trouble of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
Australia’s British American Tobacco said the industry focuses more on what new regulations involve rather than marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering enforcing similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the mandatory inclusion of images on the boxes.
Currently they are mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, harsher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“Photography doesn’t affect me.
I just don’t listen to them.”
“You pick up the cigarette and keep the package,” says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
“It’s just one reason I’d quit smoking: for my daughter.”
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in downtown Sydney, indicates that uniform boxes make it more difficult to put them on shelves.
“It usually took an hour to unravel a delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it’s, okay, it’s over and we closed the store,” he says while raising his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get bored a little bit
During this year’s Thanksgiving holidays, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free stores.
But there are more and more academics and child development experts who praise the goods of boredom.
According to them, it’s okay that both us and our children get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in good mood?
Yeah, yeah.
And I don't.
But we will talk about it later.
First, like many people, I supposed that now that we have more time for leisure, boring would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not.
“In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin about the boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and raising the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “wanting but not being able to participate in an activity that fills you.”
The difference between boredom and apathy is that the person doesn’t do something but wants to do it.
It points out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom may sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed think they have the problem.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble focusing.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a tape from a person reading the article from a magazine.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-volume television show that had no connection, others listened to it with the low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the low-volume program showed more boring than the other two groups; it was hard for them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to the boring.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, disrupting attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, such as detecting defective pieces on a manufacturing line, music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or crawling, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is to be bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed in the 1980s a “scale of boredom trend.”
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things I'm interested in that I don't have time to do it all."
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, teenagers are a kind of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he wasn’t in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he knew was that “adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest quotas,” largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning, is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, as, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to be exposed to absurd physical risks, such as wagering or falling into substance consumption as a method to combat it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Boredom is the way the brain tells you you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he hasn’t learned to entertain himself or dose himself,” Professor Fenske says.
And "that ability to dosage applies to other situations," he notes.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don’t think we really want to praise the boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Our goal should rather be to feel comfortable away from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boring is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate it to something worthwhile,” he says.
He points out that what people really seek is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when noise ceases.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Consumption Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community institute and a footballer in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of some marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when police stopped them.
Police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a court appeal for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences each carrying a US$100 fine) informing him of the trial date.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote for the legalization of the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on law than on location.
Hundreds of minor offences for marijuana possession are being cancelled both here and in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have ceased to file charges against persons over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be passed legally once the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s more conservative district prosecutors have pledged to continue with marijuana possession cases and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“All of this is changing so quickly that I don’t know what will be next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those who are in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice on establishing a production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licensing system, all before the deadline arrives, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for good or for evil, Colorado goes ahead of most states in terms of regulation of marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what could work.
“There is no real precedent that serves as a model,” he says.
The law of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which you will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to offer “adequate access” to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of conducting cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centres.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On November 21, Aurora’s police chief Oates sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would cease to bring lawsuits for minor offences for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 and that police would cease to file charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police chief Oates said they would be responsible for enforcing the city’s regulations that regulate marijuana cultivation for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug dealers and salesmen.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers and that they decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those faults that at the time they occurred were a crime,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative on legalizing marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer quote adults for possession of small quantities.
Pete Hautzinger, county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
“I don’t think you’re wasting your time continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Even though 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing marijuana consumption for recreational use to the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials with respect to the great environmental experiment in this state.
“This is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney representing the accused for possession of marijuana and a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of the Marijuana Law.
“They’ve spent so long bringing people to court that they can’t actually still accept it to be legal,” he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the national test cases for drug legalization.
While state lawyers and officials have a new legal sales boundary, they also look forward to receiving instructions from the federal government, which still provides for selling and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates for the legalization of marijuana are hoping the Department of Justice will give up.
Despite some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has allowed mostly marijuana selling businesses for these purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
“Although anti-drug agents are likely not to throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of recreational marijuana, allowed under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser at the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to get into a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the town hall.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of what the community voted against voting in favor of what the state voted.”
Many questions arise about it.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I was thrown out of Oxford for being a Tory"
College students are not attacked for their views just now.
I don’t remember any moment in my life when I haven’t been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been where I supposed to be the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I took my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the history career, I had already packed the bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper The Evening Standard claimed that I had quit because I didn’t tolerate some collegemates having sex in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had gone because I was forced to drink in cups.
The truth was less fun.
I fled from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that it came from a private school.
I was harassed for only one reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
Perhaps you wonder what that is coming for now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-wing students is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students is such in Oxford that last week a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR at Corpus Christi College say they are “often seriously separated, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the equal opportunities committee of their college to make sure they can freely express their opinions.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary entitled "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" on student politics and presenting the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
He showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with a silver handle.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as “Turkish heads” for introducing higher tuition rates.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice president of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
People assume we are like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who submitted the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old president-elect of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members toward center-right people has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford I was more lonely than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
Last year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an "honoris causa" degree after cuts in the financing of higher education.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the welcome week to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a show of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that the professors not only looked big at the mockery of conservative university students, but they participated in it willingly.
The policy of miners’ strike, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminar.
The first I attended was to translate French texts from the eighteenth century into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Ms. Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't give one.
Pitt, a low man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew well how to eject bad bile.
“Is thatcherists refusing to learn French or are they simply fools?” he asked.
The other college students laughed.
My eyes were burning from the tears I tried to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt grumbled.
I returned to my room as a soul in sorrow.
That night I sat alone at the time of dinner at college; then I felt a slight knock in my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly said.
“I’m afraid that’s how it goes.
They get in with anyone who is suspected of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so for you it'll be even worse.
Many newcomer Tories appear to be Labourists.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick turned out useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that little song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They beat each other, don't they?"
I felt the same way homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who would think like me only after dusk?
Should I become Labourist and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years awaiting me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history for my college.
They hated him for being not only of the Conservative Party, but also Thatcher’s foreign policy advisor and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely out there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took a chair at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I started moving daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding shelter in my family and friends with a more open metropolitan mindset.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But if it’s the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
“They would never do that, not there among my beloved dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude.”
His painful eyes began to cloud.
“Give him another chance.
I'm sure they've done it just to joke.
My heart would be broken if you left him.”
Exhausted with so many trips to London, my emotional endurance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his credo.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had insinuated, speaking totally seriously, that I was a "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and I called them "old stupid."
The truce lasted for a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was locked.
I was inside wrapped in fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left I packed and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak crying.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but, to this day, hides behind an unworthy reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of the Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worth hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Maestro de la Couture", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 high-end dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This show is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarity and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos with the signature of the most aristocratic pomegranate, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from humble costume of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong with it.
“At least they don’t shut off their chips on your magnificent carpet as some beautiful pop celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his villa in Gstaad," explains the former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also forgets the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, everything looked and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Paris High Couture Week, in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art,” she remats.
Alcurnia Parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-corresponded loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-foot-long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must march along the walkway to contemplate a dream "audience" that looks like Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with the On Aristot.
In that audience of mannequins shines names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modest, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a Gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he made to me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty,” she added.
I really like the colors it uses, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriber Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergt can also forget the first time she dressed a Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting the age and the opportunity to wear one of his night suits...
The time finally arrived in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with fly skirt, draped "corsage" and word of honour neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashion party dresses with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories that it carries."
The "King" of Fashion
The great end of Somerset House’s exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding costume at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion designer calls his seams) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different lace types and a four-and-a-half-foot tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a milestone of the late 20th century haute couture, "the return of the clients of high society."
Obfuscated for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is his best exemplar.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of her clients.
“I have always been attracted by his refinement, his calmness, his pulcro and perfect look,” D’Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
“It was impeccable, time doesn’t pass for him.”
If a princess says so...
The toughest craft in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers play life and health by loading 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone trails
There are people for whom their job is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living by taking sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfur gas emanating from the Earth's entrains solidifies when it comes into contact with air.
After tearing out large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, it carries them in two baskets of bamboo that loads on their shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb as a turtle, keeping balance and tensely measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the cliff.
They know that any sweat could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who dumped years ago on the scratches of the Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn five euro cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once up, the tourists who photograph them as circus monkeys open their way and, loading the heavy baskets tirefully, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulfur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make fireworks, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As usual it is to load 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries three times a day.
It takes three hours in each and ends ground, but allow it to collect 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhumane effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
“The miners’ journal is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” the carrier explains, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the slice was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java."
Anto has asthma, breathes hard, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing his skin on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already started paying his bill despite covering his face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It’s the price you need to pay to achieve your dream.
“I’ll work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and smart young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cabin with other carriers, he rises every day at two o’clock in the morning because the sulfur doesn’t stop running at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends to the crater lighting up with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its penguin benefits, the mining company has not machined sulfur extraction to save costs or supplied any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and at the same weight.
In fact, they don’t even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for the beasts and not for people,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old furnished carrier who has been in the Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
Able to lift up to 110 pounds, he says he will endure working "as much as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between the ages of 18 and 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and sticks the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and catches the miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, they are so hard that none complains of serious illnesses ... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pains and sores in the shoulders, which have been misformed by weight.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can already carry only 50 pounds at age 53.
Every day, he and his companions pull 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away, along a goat road between the weeds.
“I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life,” Unainik proclaims opening his mouth, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the toughest crafts in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, the stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we believe life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an advertisement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rap that uses local references such as "Let's put a bao in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hoping that with the announcement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is purely about the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was a topic we had to address.
We knew the government had tried a lot of things, such as tossing perfumes with pheromones or arranging fast-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don’t we do as creative as we can to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn’t take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as replenishment rate – was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies at the National Population Division, says it is due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marrying and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to increased singleness, and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a U.E. immigration policy peaked on dramatically increasing immigration to address the decline in population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, is abundant, criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe box", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of real estate firm EL Developers, says their "shoe boxes" are sold much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units run out days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, which were previously blocked if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too Stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules can be a step toward increasing national birth rates, talking to Singaporeans working in the center’s financial district seems like they won’t have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, and education is too, so many people are postponing it,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another young man about 20 years old.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
The private offline is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is the quality of private or "the sphere of private life that is entitled to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under the age of 16?
How do you apply this definition to your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by ventilating on the Internet situations you would certainly not share offline?
The Journal interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on the personal level, and “in the user’s key and name,” when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t be uploaded to a post,” says ten-year-old Jorge when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“They’re very secret secrets, my mom may know them, but not everyone,” she says.
On FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I am also talking to my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo other than mine, or someone who’s making ridicule,” she says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he meets the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just get them up,” he adds.
“Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” she says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14, is different.
The teenager has opened accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits he did not know 20 of the people added to his friends list.
“I’m not afraid, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for his home address or phone number.
“If I was pressured or asked to do so, I simply took them out of my account,” he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“I never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"It only gave him privacy."
Then explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I'd do it, if I like it or I like it.
“Although I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents it should be understood that the purpose of social media is to inform.
“The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these sites they changed the rules of the game,” he says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Native and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we're asking them to have a definite criterion on what is worth spreading, publishing or telling at an age that maturity doesn't help."
“They are also selective when what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't help," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to be posted a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people for permission to tag them?
And one more, do everyone need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, equally must be on social media,” he says.
Surveillance
Stuart Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is indispensable for parents to read the policies of social media awarely.
By understanding each of the incisions they have solid grounds for talking to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of “don’t talk to strangers.”
UNASUR Summit Ends Without Making Public Lima Declaration
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded in Peru today without the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assisting presidents.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources of the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency initially pointed out that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later stated that it will be published at some point on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When they were consulted by the text, they pointed out that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day only the soundless video of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, audio restricted".
The little information circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the appointment, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
The Peruvian Presidency subsequently sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is about Humala's statement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South America-Arab Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, neither was the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities endeavored to ensure that there were safe broadcasting systems for all journalists, but limited the obtaining of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment by the Court of The Hague that addresses a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both sides, in the trial Lima filed against Santiago.
“We will comply with and execute the judgment that defines the differences we are bringing to this international court today,” Humala said, along with his Chilean pair.
“Chile has been, is and will remain a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts,” Piñera said.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered seriously erroneous.
The summit was held with the inassistence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action lines for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments were set.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take “important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the residence agreements.”
He said actions are being promoted to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-priced internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address natural disaster risks.”
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant matrix but must serve to broaden our productive matrix and glimpse a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it gave no further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for his reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,” from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace, and good neighbourly relations, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this regard, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before starting his participation in the regional meeting he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan pair, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal in a respectful way with the maritime dispute following a ICJ ruling, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not excluding, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell you that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He defended, in that sense, the plan to establish the South American citizenship that the member countries of the Unasur encourage.
“We have to achieve the free mobility of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also expressed his support for the re-composition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of lowering the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give chair never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said in reference to Ecuador’s political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he was not regrettable of that decision because he did not betray his principles, but rather respected his "deep democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, "there were reasonable suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that he be subjected to interrogation in his territory for an alleged sexual offence when “Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out through videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there is a risk of deteriorating Assange’s physical and mental health.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," he said.
What there is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa noted that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a salvage duct to allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities, and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of proceedings in different European instances,” he said.
And he thought that "if Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this is over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem ends.
Correa reaffirmed himself as an advocate for freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate is " mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and evil politicians but the evil journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, it was welcomed that it is no longer these journalists "not the bankers, nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries who dominate Ecuador", and he said that being re-elected "will deepen into the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay’s veto in the Unasur until at least its next elections, arguing that the body “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legal coupism” because it actually “destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.”
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this failure is not met.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to walk together.
They need to be processed extensively to overcome them and move forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries that Peru and Chile hold in the same court and thought that "it is correct for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept judgment as hard as it may be."
Referring to the possibility that he would be presenting himself as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite tough."
Correa said if he loses the February 2013 elections he will withdraw from public life.
I have never been personally interested in power, but in situations as unfair as that of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
“My political movement believed it was me who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
Winning would be my last period in the presidency and from there we got out of public life.
If we lose the same.
“It’s a decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima at the sixth summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths are cause of delayed detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," he says, recalling the time of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "softer", without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such an effort that he already celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was bringing a cut."
So having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their illness, still many people arrive when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who initiates treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG HIV Unit, after noting that this information was endorsed in April of this year in a prestigi scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of immune system affected by patients at the start of diagnosis, with better expectations for non-drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200.
In simple words, this means that anyone who receives a positive diagnosis of HIV at the age of 25, under these terms “as long as they remain in control will be able to live smoothly until age 75,” the interviewee explained.
To scale this advance, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, with 187 deaths until May of this year; however, it is assured that universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been available since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That’s how I see it, so it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a medication shortage the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they are unknown to their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have any opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make early diagnosis and therefore have to be offered screening in a massive way, to all people who require it.”
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) agree, also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a particular laboratory to take the test, only motivated because he had made it a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I'd better crash three times a week," they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
To date, her parents only know she had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active, but co-responsible sexual life, I take care of myself and the other person," Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony to those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Have the test, if you were at risk, the sooner you know if you are HIV-positive, it is better and if you already have the diagnosis, that you learn that you can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the battle motto for AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a covert journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
And the biggest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "condom distribution has been effectively increased, before we were given one or two, now they give us a hundred packages, and that's great but it turns out that there are those today, still, who don't have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you love them?" is a common question, with sneaky and valuable judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and healthcare personnel, which teenagers don't want to be exposed to, the communicator said.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that the condoms should not be just behind the counters and that those hundred should be found in public toilet dispatchers of the sites that young people frequent.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them for chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking him if he would have distributed condoms in his Administration.
“That’s not sexuality, it’s best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity,” he said.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th national in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the infections correspond to the sexual pathway, 6% to the bloodway and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who don’t know it.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court a judgment that is unknown to the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved through a merchant contest in Mexico, the scenario places a nefarious precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the survival procedures of the firms allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, in contrast to international conventions.
On the practical ground, the backup to the judgment issued on June 15 by Bankruptcy Court Judge Harlin Hale for the northern district of Texas leaves Mexican firms helpless in the face of the possibility of embargo of their properties in beyond the Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door to Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
Initially, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Appeals Court says that the main proceedings are the merchant contest held in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, to that end, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created, with the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of the merchant competition the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, the Vitro was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts have been endorsed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the United States Courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The fact is omitted by the Court of Appeals.
From another angle, Vitro blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 onwards in the wake of the serious economic crisis facing the United States, hitting the country.
For the time being, the signature of the González Sada family will lodge an appeal of reconsideration before the appeal court itself so that the vote reaches the plenary, i.e. the five magistrates, since only three voted.
If it does not succeed, Cerciorare’s appeal will be claimed which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher instance, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The serious thing about the case is that the court dismissed a document submitted by the government of Mexico in the form of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Law of Mercantile Competitions, noting that it was dismissed with the agreements signed by both countries to match this with Chapter 15 of the Bancar Law.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambola of two bands: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Balance General
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by the Mexican Aviation Trade Unions against the company’s former owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Union Association of Aviation Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The court headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission who is accused of obstructing justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust F/589 of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Close to the Dragon Mart
Gathered this weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had succeeded in unifying the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental thing that ravaged part of protected areas and raises the mother of all the amagos against the industry.
The ACTA died
A Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Falsification Trade Agreement, known for its acronyms as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been linked to the sport of the board for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as broad as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was a smaller-class player, National Higher Basketball player, seized and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Federation of Basketball.
“I put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, as when I was chairman of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal chairman during the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamon, where he lived with his faithful wife Isabel for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Reyes doesn’t exaggerate making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his broad trajectory, attest to it.
Bavarian in the heart
Of all, the most emotionally treasured are those that recall his passing through the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years of age acting as a co-powered or captured franchise.
“These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy Championships since 1967, whether as a captain, co-captain or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at BSN.
From then on he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong player, 6"7" of stature.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativised and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another.
The championship of the Cowboys with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, since by 1988 he was already a federal commander.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executives and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympic in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we reached fourth place and it must have been bronze not because of that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final move for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that perhaps wasn’t the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a youthful Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of the players suspended by the mess of the Pan American Mar del Plata, we won gold against all forecasts.
Who has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, that was Piculin Ortiz.
Their numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has mastered at that level as Piculin did.
And that without counting his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who has been the best Boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good cottage that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young people, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What have you left to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, that Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the Island in national playoffs.
Right now, children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, officers and referees.
That's what I'm pleased about.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a scrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predator oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new "Dallas" season, died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the iconic role he liked the most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her advertiser Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
“It was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
She plays Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his home.
He also starred in two short-time comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included critically well-received roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars at bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record audience at that time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and made "Dallas" the second most seen entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left the city, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) to hospital.
“I know what I want on J.R’s tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only negotiation he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, in and out of the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who were fortunate to know and love Him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT channel.
The recording of five of the chapters for season two had already been completed and a sixth was in progress, the channel reported.
There was no immediate pronouncement from either Warner or TNT about how the series will handle Hagman's loss.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He was lucky on the New York theatre stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I thought would hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant he became an organ donation promoter and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it’ll be a bit uncomfortable for a brief time, but they’re going to be fine.”
She was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start course exploring the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clinged as a proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what he would expect in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "deudarmageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only teacher offering courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the "Media, Culture and the End of the World" course.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, it could break out a war.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic topics and explored how they compare them to real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
At the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to give a course, titled only "The End of the World".
“We didn’t add ‘2012’ to always have the option to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no other choice than working “until the same night that the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It saturated in two hours," Restall said about his course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of the career in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a teacher — said they believed in the expiry date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and we somehow discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old and West Chester student at Temple.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
But he pointed out that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
“People elsewhere don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question if he knew about any course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines are not involved in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting on an exception from a higher authority.
We have an indulgence from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years many days of the final judgment have been spoken, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, “people will immediately begin to think about the next date” or philosopher that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "the end of the world" parties.
“Maybe I call some friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
