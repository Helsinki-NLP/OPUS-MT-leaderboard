Food is to blame for European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the eurozone is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the eurozone, the growth rate was higher than expected in November – after the 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were only 3%, Bloomberg said.
In contrast to the U.S., British, and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the lead interest rate. In its discretion, the lowering of interest rates would favor rising commodity prices and a slight drop in unemployment to the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB is striving to keep the inflation rate below 2%, or at least close to the 2% mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the Zwickmühle: “We have to ‘dismiss’ inflation in order to exclude the need for action at a later stage.
At 3.3 percent, the rate of inflation reached a twelve-year high in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate climbed from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
The rise in inflation in the eurozone is due to rising food and energy prices.
MATIF wheat listings increased by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans also reached a record high since 1973.
There was also a significant increase in food oil and dairy products in 2007.
The world market price of crude oil rose this year by 52 percent - last month, the price per barrel of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent in 2008, although it is expected to decline to 1.9 percent in 2009.
Analysts expect a 3 percent inflation rate for the next 3-4 months, but the annual average rate is 2.1 percent.
Experts expect the ECB to reduce interest rates twice for 2008.
Gallup spots government crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathizers has grown considerably until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the approval for the socialists, according to Gallup, has reached an unprecedented low of 13 percent.
The difference among partisan voters is clear thanks to the high determination of opposition supporters: more than two-thirds (71 percent) are in favor of a fifth (20 percent) of the MSZP.
According to a survey, MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entrance barrier: they reach 2% in the total population.
The number of party voters has increased by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last low, the overall economic atmosphere has deteriorated further – never before was the proportion of those who judge the country’s economic situation as “extremely poor” so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent think it is “fairly poor.”
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the coming year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one-tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey conducted in December found that 71% of respondents — a historic high — judged the Prime Minister’s work as “rather bad than right.”
Thirteen percent of respondents generally have great confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of advocates for Viktor Orbán makes up 38 percent.
Approximately 54% do not trust the leader at all, compared to 27% distrust against the leader of the Fidesz party.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think you could get control of the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without a change of government.
After the unrest last October, 35% had voted in favour of the remainder of the government and the leader, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked about their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they would "securely" participate, and another 20 percent would "probably" vote.
For comparison, if the parliamentary elections were to take place on Sunday, only 55% would go to the polls "with certainty" and another 15% would consider their participation to be "probable".
74% would vote against tuition fees, 79% would vote against practice fees, and 84% would vote against hospital daily fees.
Translated to the group of participants in the referendum "with certainty" the proportions of opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, and 89 percent, respectively.
Also most expensive, Tesco increased by nearly a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Buda's trading area also maintained the average price increase of 16% from last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
The price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" also increased by 16 percent this year in the Budaurs trade triangle, although prices increased by more than 1,000 HUF in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets have “soaring up” last December, the downturn has not been dramatic compared to the previously high level.
However, it is certainly dissuading for consumers that what they paid well under HUF 9,000 last year is not even available this year for HUF 10,000.
The price of the "Napi" shopping cart exceeded the magical 10,000 HUF limit by at least HUF 91 in the markets studied.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6,800, the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and lively fish remained nearly at the level of the previous year, while prices for turkey breast filets, nuts and poppy have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread were in line with the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but Auchan had 1kg of bread wakes for 139 Forints.
There was no competitive price drop in the product to below 200 Forints.
Also surprising here was the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola deposit bottle of under 200 forints, so the drink including deposit cost only HUF 257.
Nevertheless, this year's "Napi" basket comparison Auchan was the most expensive, and Cora was the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora’s prices in the “Napi” basket compared to Christmas prices last year have increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan respectively have increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest basket of last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was HUF 1,480.00.
The average price increase last year was still 1,206.00 Forint, but the increase in VAT prices at last Christmas was noticeable.
Exactly this process has hit the trade badly: apparently the warehouses were not able to decide exactly what price margin they should apply to the individual items, as the effects of the price increase on consumer behavior were unpredictable.
(If the trader plans the speed of circulation of a product poorly, it may fall by substantial profits in the price range that depends on the traffic intensity.)
Due to VAT, the cost of the "Napi" basket last year fell so radically that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price difference for the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost 1,630.00 Forint more than the previous year, and even the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase showed, with the price of daily consumption items in hypermarkets rising more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, in turn, does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: for some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office identified an increase of more than 30 per cent over the 12-month period.
In addition to flour, eggs.)
However, if you take a look at the "Napi" shopping basket, this seems almost impossible with the latter, since the price level of the product already expensive last year has risen by barely more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Obviously, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers - after all, they were able to roll the drastic price increase to the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; good years are reported ongoing.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses no longer look at prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable food goes in pallets over the shop tables.
Wednesday morning there were endless snakes at the cash shop in all three warehouses, when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to opinion researchers that they could not even achieve the planned sales, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many places are saved on disinfectants
More than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals this year due to improper antibiotic treatment.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overoccupation of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that do not help to curb infections, according to the senior doctor of the National Epidemiology Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
In the traumatology department of János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was a similar infection.
The injured in a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly afterwards the man had to return with an MRSA infection. A major surgery could not be done since then because of the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
By 10 December of this year, 1094 infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens were reported from hospitals to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the senior doctor of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark number is likely to be higher.
Approximately two-thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium carries about a third of people in their nose without causing any disease.
SA-related infections (such as throat, tonsillitis, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well curable.
However, if the means are dosed too high or misused, antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are well-responding will result in rapid spread to hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weakened, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the daily hospital.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA only does not exist where it is not sought.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wears rubber gloves and masks in the care, and we have the necessary antibiotics for the treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are examined for MRSA when they are admitted to the hospital, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling too rarely
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavorable to curb the formation or spread of the multi-resistant pathogen, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and nursing homes, the hospitals should examine the induced patients and immediately isolate MRSA infected patients.
However, microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced in Hungarian hospitals.
Not least because there are no subsidies on the part of the state health insurance fund for this examination.
Most cases would therefore only come to light when the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, according to the medical director of the epidemiology center.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and diseases in Hungary.
Antibiotic therapies should be targeted, that is, microbiological examinations are necessary so that no resistance to the remedy can develop, but this directive is not always followed by hospitals.
Among the outpatient or primary care patients, microbiological sampling is even less common, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Saved in disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most often transmitted by nurses from one patient to another.
This is why hand washing, or wearing gloves and masks are of great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection or contact, but there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patient in local hospitals.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds lined close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, it even occurs in less well-established financial hospitals that disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that favor the development of infections.
Such infections have been shown to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the pathogen can be stopped where these protective measures are complied with, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government Programme Against MRSA
Getting under control of MRSA infections causes health insurance enormous costs, so they are being fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its containment, was recorded in the government program.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Center for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of multiresistant pathogens (including MRSA) as one of its priorities, as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals.
Death Police Chief was not drunk
In the case of a deadly car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district, the official opinion is now available.
The now resigned police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholic nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press spokesman for the Budapest High Prosecutor’s Office on Friday after the official opinion on the case was submitted.
The report confirmed the results of the initial investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he sat on the wheel.
The former police chief bowed into Kossuth Lajos Street with his own car in the XXII district, crossing a 55-year-old man crossing the road at an unmarked spot.
(According to StVO, however, this is not a milder circumstance - the steering wheel has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the zebra strip, subordinate.)
The pedestrian was injured after being admitted to the hospital.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then resigned his functions and requested retirement.
The Budapest Prosecutor’s Office has started its investigation into the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three loan agreements worth EUR 400 million in Budapest on Friday.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a €300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects undertaken with subsidies from the Cohesion Fund. The loan contract of €100 million was signed earlier, the current agreement deals with the use of the €200 million granted.
The €150 million agreed in the loan agreement will also be spent on the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has allocated a total of EUR 300 million to Hungary for this purpose; the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided on later as part of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the contracting partners have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will be mainly invested in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also addressed.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has clarified the details of subway financing with the EU, the original contract and any amendments will be re-debated.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loan interest rates are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a deferment of 8 years, free of provisions.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all over Europe looks closely at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but is rapidly becoming more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most coveted pavement for real estate purchases in the Eastern European region, with affordable ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar are the racers, but real estate around Kavarna and Balcik is also increasingly in demand.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the interior of the country will sooner or later also attract investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the very cheap area of Russia has more buyers.
The capital Sofia also offers enticing offers - trading and office spaces offer the highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, and thus attracting tourists in addition to the summer and winter seasons, as well as the other two seasons.
Forward-looking investors are therefore already buying in large-scale fashion, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people purchasing real estate in Bulgaria are also striving to change their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are predominantly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and the ski resorts.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle buy either revitalized properties for 50-100,000 euros, or fallen homes for 5-15,000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication options are great, but also the proximity to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for buyers.
The second category includes those looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed among the top ten German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest with the aim of medium to long-term value increase.
Real estate in the capital, however, is becoming constantly more expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been an increase of 21% annually.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Environment Minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are consulting on the Bali roadmap, which sets out emissions-reducing measures for the post-2012 period, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
Currently, there is a heavy debate between developed and developing countries.
The U.S. has already signaled that it does not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries are willing, in addition to reducing emissions, to support developing countries both financially and technologically.
An agreement on support for developing countries has also been reached.
The adjustment fund under the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-member council, which is expected to be reviewed by the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), as read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Environment Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that by 2020, the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (measured to 1990 levels), whether or not the "post-2012 agreement" will be successfully reached. The Union would even be prepared to advocate for a 30 percent reduction, provided other large industrialized countries in the world, or developing countries, are also prepared to comply with their obligations as they can and are responsible.
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the objective of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, while the EU and its then 15 member states had already committed to a reduction of 8%.
The benchmark for Hungary is a 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1985-87 - a benchmark that the country will fulfill, as read in the Environment Ministry's press release.
The commitment is high on Bali - after all, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly not enter into force until 2012. In this case, the reduction project set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a renewed international emission reduction system, the importance of which was also highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific committee on climate change, which was recently awarded by the UN.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and the rise of the Earth’s average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, resulting in extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to scientists.
British Army Advertises on YouTube
British army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to increase popularity on the video portal.
Initially, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos of operations against the Taliban online since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The images shot with miniature cameras attached to helmets are checked at the Air Force Base in Kandahar and subsequently sent to London, where they are put on the Internet.
The inevitable political message
Air Force soldiers have already contributed 139 such shots, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos of Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the international peacekeeping forces (MNFI) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force released the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Publicized propaganda of this kind is almost free compared to conventional television advertising, defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message as they confirm the right to exist of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur footage, which, in addition to the carefully processed, censored footage, also put it on the net - such as those that show the deaths of the soldiers: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the losses are spoken at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, from the scenes of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos shot in use have already been loaded to the platform, but the British have only recently discovered this "genre" for themselves.
The Americans, however, advertise in a slightly different way, namely with the freely downloadable shooting game "America's Army", in which the player can slip into the skin of the soldier as part of a more or less life-saving simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatche in the Ministries
Labour Minister Monika Lamperth isn’t at all chilling: Instead of a Christmas party, she hosts a work conference, where her employees can have the year 2007 finished with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others enchanting Christmas mood with Tombola or boost in the official hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so celebrates the power.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year at the Defence Resort, but it is not expected that the ministry’s employees will do so.
At the "Christmas celebration of the orphans" children are presented by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission celebration" family members are hosted by currently stationed soldiers abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the celebrations.
Compared to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NFS) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transportation are proposing the threads.
The Ministry of Economy’s 4.32 million Forint Christmas celebration is held in the House of the Future, with about 350 of the 600 employees expected.
While the focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, there will also be live acts and a Tombola draw.
The National Development Agency (NFS) held its 4.7 million Forint costly Christmas celebration on Wednesday at the House of the National Justice Council (ILO), with concerts and a feast.
The room rental was 1 million forints, the remainder was spent on the more than 400 invited guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is also invited to another Christmas celebration hosted by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspieltheater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information as we have not reached the competent persons.
Why the suit?
The ILO building was open not only to NFÜ guests, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas party on December 7.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The ceremonies were opened with a speech by the minister, after dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was stated that there was no ball dress or suit duty on the ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour, and Self-Government are preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health is hosting the celebration for employees in its own four walls for around 400,000 Forints.
Labour Minister Monika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party at all, but to a conference on the year’s outing.
It is estimated that about 180 guests will be accommodated with coffee and pogatche, according to the press department, so the celebration ends with 350,000 forints.
Self-Government Minister Gordon Bajnai is simply getting started with his colleagues in the classroom of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) hosts a Christmas party in its own feast hall, at which 436 employees are expected.
Expenditures were measured at 2,500 Forints per capita - for that money there is a buffet receipt with subsequent incentives.
Since the beginning of János Veres’ term, the PM’s employees celebrate this every year.
However, there will be no real party mood - not only because of the Minister's official speech but also because the celebration was scheduled for the afternoon.
On January 20th, the Ministry of Agriculture invites to a New Year’s reception, this time the Ministry’s Christmas celebration is out.
The one hundred guests are invited to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured at 1,000 Forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception, to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The receptions that are held every year traditionally begin with a short speech by the minister and sound with reluctant snacks.
As the corresponding press offices report on [origo] inquiry, there will be neither a Christmas party at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor at the Ministry of Education.
When asked about the costs of the Christmas party, the press department of the Ministry of the Environment could not be informed.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the celebration, which is hosted at the Arts Museum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation will form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite strike beginning on Monday.
A large protest assembly will be held on Saturday, on Monday - the day of the referendum on the health insurance law - the dismissal of work begins.
It is expected that there will be significant strike-related traffic disabilities, as railway traffic is almost completely discontinued, and the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) will also strike until 1 p.m.
Details of Monday’s strike will be announced jointly by the union league and the union federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee will also be established, responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A large protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and from Monday all organizations joining the strike will set up work for an indefinite period of time, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike starting on the day of the parliamentary vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, if the law is passed, the strike shoots meet to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even conceivable that it will not come until the later evening hours, or even until midnight, to vote on the health insurance law.
The strikes starting on Monday will have to count on significant traffic disabilities: railway workers are delaying their work for indefinite time, in the morning most of the public transportation and more than half of the Volán societies are still.
At the same time, in many places there will be motorway blockages in one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous unions and civilian organizations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the league website.
Some organizations announced indefinite strikes, others planning a temporary termination of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the VDSZSZ railway workers on adequate achievements, although more and more people are travelling by rail just around the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, the BKV will strike between 7 and 9 a.m. at the Budapest Airport, the LIGA Electricity and Heat Trade Unions will depose work for four hours, and the Democratic Teacher Trade Union will call for 2 or 2-8 hours of strikes, respectively.
The Hungarian Medical Association strikes nationwide at various times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Employees, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Trade Union Cooperation, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the league is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and presents a new concept for social discourse.
The second demand concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Demand number three is that access to the early retirement system be allowed for the qualifying professional groups before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZSZ, a member of the League of Trade Unions, has not accepted the proposal submitted by the Ministry of Transport concerning the sidelines and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded this August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary", have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "Risk Warning Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk poses the "exacerbation of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy populations in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic clashes in the short term."
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which presumably aims to provoke such a confrontation, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is considered a failure by political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question to representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary opposition."
It is suspected that this would exacerbate the problem, make reasonable dialogue impossible, favor limbs, and increase the likelihood of violent clashes.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "have severely damaged the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary has been continuously booming, so that since summer 2007 several organizations called "national self-defense associations" have been founded.
"These groups are common in defining themselves as a civilian organization, while openly boasting about preparing their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (catastrophic protection, national defense, order protection), citing the inappropriateness of the police, the army, or the state itself."
And further: all this is done according to that method that tries to conceal various political aspirations as a bourgeois initiative, based on the political and party distress of the population.
The emphasis on the civil nature and the form of association, therefore, is not only for the circumvention of legal obstacles that could arise in the course of the registration at the court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As can be seen from the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-enhancing factor in relations with neighbouring countries.
In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighboring states as a potential source of danger, so some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighboring countries see the emergence of the Hungarian Guard as confirmation of its own anti-Hungary policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region,” he said.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard were the Roma mass riots that took place in a neighborhood of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents as an occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, arguing that the aim of the organization is "national protection".
In their view, in the past 17 years, a real "Gypsy terror" has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent - according to Political Capital.
Furthermore, the initiative would have started a heavy debate in the Bulgarian public.
As I said, the increased risk of ethnic clashes is also evidenced by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations have announced that they will set up their own guards for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard so far show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma will also respond to the threats by organizing their own protection, says Political Capital’s risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, research director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news agency: Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually, and if risk-changing trends were identifiable, public opinion is informed, as in the case by issuing the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are precisely regulated by law, so the practice of re-disposing working days around the holidays has now established itself, but the next year gives us fewer such days.
Also in the EU and in America, something else is understood as “Holidays”.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state holidays and unemployed days.
Work-free days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
We also celebrate New Year, for example: Both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are days without work - the latter alone so that the New Year's Eve celebrations can rest.
Throughout the year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are March 15th, commemorating the Revolution of 1848, and October 23th, commemoration of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the establishment of the state, on May 1 the work is celebrated, on November 1 and 2 we commemorate our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays each on Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proven itself in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on the Saturdays before it, or go to school.
When that day, which falls before or after the holiday, will ultimately be processed, has long been determined by the Minister of Labour in a separate regulation.
The legislation applies to all employers and employees, public employees and public service officials alike.
Except only companies and facilities where the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
Only the holidays at the end of the year make the working rules a little confused: from December 24, life in this country remains formal, as most take the holidays specially suspended for the days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
Next year, more holidays fall into the middle of the week, or to the end of the week, so there will be fewer rearrangements on the working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed around the day of work so that people can stay at home for just four days.
Saturday, April 26th will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second rearrangement is related to the holiday on October 23rd: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to work out in advance on Friday, October 24th.
The end of the year, however, will be in the sign of the holidays, after everything lies and stands from December 24, even if New Year's Eve falls on a Wednesday.
Six dissuasive little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive – harmless lies that we don’t notice at all: they bring “color” into everyday workplace life.
The question is just whether to get used to these little inconveniences, or to better face the challenge and try to avoid them misunderstood, consciously for other annoying situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone from the marketing department called," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you regret it and try to make it right by perhaps calling the marketing department and regrettably confessing that you would have forgotten to align the message (this is the less usual method).
Most of the time, this is done with an excuse.
Before engaging in embarrassing excuses, you should consider what you can do to give your colleagues really unpleasant moments and try to consciously avoid these situations.
Are you borrowing something that is not your own?
There’s hardly anything more nervous than getting a document, office supplies, or the phone, but it’s not there.
Yesterday the stamp was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost believing pen discovered on a colleague’s desk?
Without questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they are rightly annoyed when they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put any covers or post-it out of the office in your pocket, because it could hit you yourself: no more there when you need it urgently.
Are you talking about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a crap that has already been put into the world.
Who with whom, what did?
Where and why?
The information (or assumptions) about the private life of colleagues should not be tied to everyone as far as possible!
And if anyone opens up and reveals his inner secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to be silent like a tomb rather than to align the person who is not present right now, even if others are aware of the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick without reason?
When you call in the office to report sick, citing tormenting headaches, because you are feeling uncomfortable at the moment, or just want to rest, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, irrevocable accomplishments, projects with fixed deadlines must now be done by colleagues instead of yourself.
Don’t play badly with our colleagues!
If you already know the day before that you will not get to the office the next day, or that something could get in the way, which is why you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly faced with the absence.
Total, smiling, phone calling
You are deepened in your work, but are suddenly disturbed by the loud smiling of the colleagues?
Do you want to hear a phone call that you shouldn’t have heard?
One should not nerve colleagues with buzzing, singing, loud conversations (which one takes over their heads), squatting, continuing sniffing or mocking.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always to blame?
If a project is not completed on time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not seek the guilt of your own forgetfulness from others!
If possible, you shouldn’t talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
It is best to admit your mistakes, and apologize if others have been affected!
The question of how to repair the mistake, or reclaim the failure, is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training trousers and slippers: Convenient for home but hasn’t lost anything in the office!
Not even if the workplace would allow you to dress so easy!
Don't be too lazy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress accordingly in the office - if desired, even pretty and elegant!
Want to do it right for everyone - or how to become uninteresting to others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning congestion.
A strange melody sounds from the radio: the sound of a violin paired with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound gem a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds on mr2.
The local music scene has not pampered us with qualitative electropop for a long time.
But now you can even see the congestion differently when you listen to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, as many new and exciting productions from the native digital underground scene are slowly contributing to a change in the overall picture, and even when the garage skirt with its guitar kitch is back "in", the native electropop proves: there is new under the sun.
Baláz’s Zságer started in Pécs, performing music even in the band Yonderboi before he started to walk his own path – perhaps because a guesthouse doesn’t tolerate two pipers.
But the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, merging the elements of jazz, electronic, and pop, he did not succeed until he had joined with the request to compose the soundtrack into a film (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had initially occurred in smaller clubs, was only known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" ranked their first album from 2002 among the top 50 native albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, became almost the only marketable trendset in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but it didn't interest anyone if they would like to wear this brand.
The band reacted as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression comes from the time when Baláz’s Zságer was still traveling with another band.
The airy, flying allusion would also be okay, but in addition to the etheric character of the music, the louder guitar - corresponding to the spirit of the time and the trends - the influences of the rock'n'roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, living in England and working with the band "The Puzzle", introduced himself to the premiere at the Millenáris.
A song from the album has even become a radio hit - the latest Mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, broadcasting pop music from early to late, has successively set the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six native singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is okay (?)
The hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: to what extent is your music reserved for a certain shift?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be thick and nonsense, but they can also be produced only for sale, which makes them commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The listener’s readiness to record also works independently of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: Abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that happen around them, much more attentive, because they also consider them part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling to see more and more coming to our concerts.
We never composed for the market.
In us, music is not for a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that in turn only occurs in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed one thing: if you want to do it right for everyone, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the road as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We don’t really go his way, let alone that you’re trying to interpret this in your music over and over again.
We see ourselves more like team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came out of his band and took a different path.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, "Wings of Love" is first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style consciously staged towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We didn’t have any plans to write a hit that would then be used as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was intended as the final of the album with which we wanted to dissolve the clangorgy and the slightly more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why exactly you, what was the guiding principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a Gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of composing the choir of talented soloists from the local music scene.
So the six-member choir – Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh – was formed, which we later named “Underground Divas”.
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did the girls make it?
B. Zs.: The number has been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was ready, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The chord sequence has formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melody the same night, later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically right away and terrifyingly spontaneously.
I remember, I was pretty electric at the time, but it already needed the "divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, however, you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There’s no solo part (apart from Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have their own role, sing perfectly together, and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by the music.
They also stood on the stage.
Is it intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not want to give them solo roles.
In the number it is also about forgetting your ego a little, forgetting who comes from and where you are going, let us just let these specific wings raise us, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel that euphoric state that we felt when the song came into being.
hvg.hu: What was the most elaborate song?
B. Zs.: In the musical creative work actually none at all, there have been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or in "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the groove didn't want to work any longer, but gradually everything has come together, like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and also now that I have "lossed" the album.
Currently it's "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Fraudulent broker risked billions for feelings of inferiority
Soilless fraudster
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel denoted the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
It came for almost five billion euros because of him.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it the same as his colleagues, besides, certainly was not incapable.
Unlike all major banks, he recognized in time the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's rather mentally weak," he was heard from the mouth of his supervisors who pointed him to the police.
But as Kerviel’s statements, published by French media, for example the daily newspaper Le Monde, show, he was a man who had made profits of 1.6 billion euros from his business at the end of last year.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros during the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
This crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn’t believe that and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had increased his profit to 1.6 billion euros.
“As soon as I earned the first half a billion, I didn’t know how to explain it,” Kerviel admits and continues to say that he definitely didn’t keep anything for himself.
During the entire interrogation, he admits that he falsified documents so that he wasn't caught up.
He even managed to turn his boss behind, even though the Eurex exchange gradually became interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she satisfied the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to gradually develop his position.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Nevertheless, he knew he would never earn as much as others.
“At my first conversation in 2005, I knew I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigator.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
He earned a lot from the shares of the Alliance by spending half a billion euros on the price losses of this title in the London bombings.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make a profit, we will let you
“It’s like a snowball,” he told the police.
But the boss allegedly knew everything, or knew it.
“As long as I earned money, my eyes were closed.”
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big blow came.
In a single day he lost a billion euros.
A weekend in mid-January he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they get to him?
He suspected himself through a vacation.
“I only took four days from last year.
A broker who doesn’t take a vacation is one who doesn’t want to be looked into the cards,” Kerviel said.
Czech Republic has a chance to reach 365 billion
Czech ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed nine development programmes yesterday, allowing the Czech Republic to reach €14 billion over the next few years.
This is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Business and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will go to transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 percent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Business and Innovation" programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to attract funds to innovative enterprises.
In this way, companies will gain finances for the introduction of new technologies, for corporate research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
In the previous acquisition of money from the EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the least successful countries to date among the new applicant countries.
Nicaraguan court acknowledges twenty-year imprisonment for former presidents
A court of appeals in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Aleman, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for $100 million (nearly 1.8 billion crown) in financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state will come back behind the grid is currently unclear, according to the AP news agency.
The Chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, says it will now depend on the detention officials whether to let Aleman sit at home his sentence or whether he has to go to jail.
A court proven four years ago that German had regularly moved government money into accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money finally ended up in a fund that Aleman had set up to finance his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget has been approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has drawn up and which was adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had presented him, and the ČSSD could not therefore allow itself to reject him.
Unlike the lively debate before the vote on the motion for distrust against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives approved this traditionally little respected, yet highly significant law in peace.
This is in a way paradoxical.
Everything starts and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but is covered up by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute between politicians is much more interesting to the public than sober figures.
The state budgets suffered from three weak points in the past Social Democratic governments that the 2008 budget cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure required by law, not only pensions but also social expenditure, which the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is the deficits in public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government’s budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors, besides tax revenues, taxes, and bank loans, spent other sources of investment, often unthinkably issuing debt bonds, which they excessively indebted their town halls.
In recent years they have managed to repay these debts by selling mass shares of the energy and other supply networks they had received from the state in the course of privatization.
This source is already drying out.
Insofar as we only adhere to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy, like the rest of the world, has gone through a phase of growth that the ČSSD is constantly boasting.
This was a unique way for their governments to settle public finances.
Instead, however, these governments owe the state even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonably than our republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly attributable to previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are at the least threatened by poverty.
Therefore, no massive social programmes are necessary, which, unfortunately, have been superfluously inflated to a huge extent in recent years.
Even though it has managed to delete some of the nonsense populist spending passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if there is no postponement of retirement age and pension reform in the near future, then virtually any policy in this country ends, and whoever is in power will remain purely managerial.
It is only slightly exaggerated to say that ruling politicians then become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenues on pensions and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the displacement of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of Crown 70 billion planned for 2008 would be quite unnecessary if previous governments had not spent in the last decade.
If we don’t really want ruling politicians to become pure administrative officials, then we need to be patient and this not too strong coalition government, but aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take on taxes and fees to rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these enable a gradual enforcement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in the financial markets together.
More than $100 billion will be auctioned to the currency markets.
On these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money from each other.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion on auction, another 24 makes it loose for the European and Swiss central bank.
It is the first time after the attacks of September 11th that the central banks of each state agree on such a coordinated approach to defense or mitigate the consequences of a financial crisis.
“This step is meant to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend,” said Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group, a consulting firm.
“Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the U.S. from 65% to about 50%,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of unserved loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect more billions of losses.
“The central banks must have really been afraid of what could happen when they decided to do this,” said Kieran Davies, chief economist at ABN Amro.
“It looks like the situation is really bad,” he continued.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to bonds, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the American economy into a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth around the world.
The central banks have decided, after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate used in leasing money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow money from each other, despite the fact that the central banks of the United States, Canada and Britain had lowered their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“This will have the same effect as a further lowering of interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step by central banks helps heat up the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Debates by ecologists are unbelievable
Global climate change allegedly harms developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus once again commented on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now referred to the end of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, no green planet", he explained that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference that forms a strange mixture of government officials and those of non-governmental organizations unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
“The debate there is unstructured, it is a word firework that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems,” Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President emphasized that the topic of the book was very important to him and that he was so committed to doing so.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation, because "I often meet on cartoons of my views."
Interested parties could now read his attitude without distortion.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climate psychologist, but he believed he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is an academic, able to understand and judge professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
As the main statement of the book, he called the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no agreed opinion among the scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore not a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are superfluous, ineffective and unacceptable.
Furthermore, he considers that, as someone who has experiences with totalitarian systems, imposing unacceptable, unproven views on others, he views this as a dangerous limitation of freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and yield."
Klaus spoke about the same topic at the Hayek Institute in Vienna two months ago.
600,000 people failed to change their driver’s license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver’s license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day you can apply for the exchange, so that the authorities will be able to issue a new driving license by the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will go onto the roads after the New Year without valid driving license.
According to the authorities, mostly those who no longer want to drive have not exchanged their driving licenses.
While small places report a sharp drop in interest in driving license exchange, the offices of the capital are overwhelmed with applications, and interest in driving license exchange continued to grow this week.
The city administration delivers around 2,000 customers daily.
You have to wait about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not changed their driver’s license yet.
The issue of a new driver’s license lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Drivers who fail to achieve the required exchange by the end of the year and start without a valid driver’s license will be fined from January.
The perpetrator pays a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police can also make it use of a reminder in the event of a breach.
In case of a breach, the penalty can rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the community can also impose a penalty on those who do not drive at all.
He could, it was said, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has already called on the offices to exercise mildness and impose a maximum penalty of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a thousand crowns of penalty.
The driver’s license is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not a card that everyone, and that is a valid one, must have.
People who don’t want to drive anymore should give up their driving license.
It is enough to take him to the competent community office or send him there by registered letter.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will become invalid.
However, drivers need to gradually exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with driver’s licenses from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of driver’s licenses issued from 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more driving licenses.
Court lowers penalties for detectives who were allied with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, who were accused of joining the gang of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years in prison.
This was decided in a final judgment by the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced their sentence by one or two years, respectively.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for the Fight Against Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
Against today’s judgment there is no appeal possibility, only revising in the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also charged in this matter, but he is before the first instance judgment.
In other cases, however, he had already received a total of 16 years of punishment.
He cannot be condemned to more.
A district court found 19 persons guilty in January, mainly for involvement in robbery, the Upper Landes Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most accused denied the charge from the outset on the grounds that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police, in consultation with Berdych, among others, handed over information from police sources, covered various robbery attacks and helped members of the gang escape prosecution.
The gang left Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey.
The indictment is about the crimes of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, for robbery, whose victims often suffered serious injuries, but also for office assumption and illicit possession of weapons.
During house searches, police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with a steel core, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
The gang, according to the accusation, has enriched itself by millions of crowns by their robbery.
In addition to nearly 20 men in this proceeding, the courts of Berdych and a number of others found themselves guilty of further robbery.
Other men from Berdych's district have to be held responsible in another trial, other cases have not yet come to court.
The main trial to date was Tomáš Pěta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish detention and awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a maternity hospital, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to ask the hospital in Třebíč for compensation of 12 million crowns plus legal costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore disagrees completely with Velebas’ proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is many times too high," Dostál said after today's trial.
“In order to form an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the opinion that the counterpart created.
We will see if it has any meaning.
But we insist that for all of us this should be in the hundreds of thousands," Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the four parents.
In the beginning, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month that they had not raised their biological daughter.
For Veleba, an expert opinion was prepared by the University Hospital in Prague Motol as the basis for compensation negotiations.
According to professionals from the field of psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men tolerated the stress situation better, even if they saw accusations that they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
The women, in turn, deal worse with the consequences of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is currently going on, Veleba summed up the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the birth hospital in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Příbyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vysočina (Bohemian Moravian Height) gave every family 100,000 crowns as a replacement for the expenses they had incurred due to the fault of the hospital in Třebíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are liability insured by law.
In case of doubt, they have to resort to a reserve fund, only in exceptional cases can they seek assistance from the carrier.
The courts have so far awarded relatively low amounts of damages to those concerned, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka came to his kingdom of Walachia
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the brand "Kingdom of Wales".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the term "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in many years of work.
Polívka did not participate in the trial today.
According to his lawyer, however, the matter is probably not over and his client is likely to appeal.
“The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in Bolek Polívkas’ popularity parasiticly,” Polívka’s lawyer said after the trial.
In the words "Walachian Kingdom" everyone introduced himself to this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
“We have a decade of work behind us.
Money raising and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is a dispute about money.
“After years, they noticed that the project was successful and that they could have some of it.
They want to win parasitic in our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television programs.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But this was not related to the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom at the time.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the idea of issuing Walachian passports.
From an originally fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity crystallized, to which Harabiš then joined the founding of the company "Walachian Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and his signature in the passports and even offered discounts to his owners when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka made public in the broadcast "Manege" for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"Polívkas' popularity certainly helped the project of the Walachian Kingdom," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team, who had dedicated themselves intensively to it.
The cooperation of today's disputed parties lasted until 2000, when Harabiš organized the official crowning for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, the disputes between Polívka and Harabiš began to accumulate, which culminated in the deposition "King Boleslav I elected until St. Nimmerlin's Day".
At Harabiš’s suggestion, Jarmila Šuláková took the leading role as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed the lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clarity in the dispute could bring about the competition prepared by Harabiš for the throne and a half-princess.
A new king should emerge from this.
Details and an appointment he did not want to give.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be something like the king's move in the Walachia.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also quietly register," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Advantages
To tell the truth, I have never been a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not worth much, the quality of the gear, steering and also the processing could be described as rather below average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combo called SW is a bit further, and I only have to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the 207, for example, I had to complain about the low head space on the rear seats.
These complaints no longer exist, because the body of the combi is designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Quickly Continue
I just go through the interior briefly, not to repeat myself too much.
It is a pretty successful design, where I have objections only because of the careful middle tunnel.
I would welcome a little more designer design, where the car will otherwise make such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may have complained about too short seats or headrests.
The side hold also improved considerably compared to the 206.
In terms of space offering, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the combo, the above-mentioned lack of headspace is also eliminated.
Suitcase in the trunk
The main thing about this car is the loading space.
I have to call it (even because of the opening back window) very well loadable and space-saving.
The cavities are equipped with holding belts, which represent an ideal compromise.
They do not disturb, let themselves separate and also hold heavier objects.
But let’s talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to the competition.
However, not compared to the best-selling vehicle of this class in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we notice that the Peugeot is left by clearly noticeable 52 litres.
For a vacation abroad or when inviting a stroller, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positives, I still have to mention the very flat loading space after folding the rear seats or even the very low loading edge.
120 hp in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline engine with a capacity of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, this should look like a 1600 cubic engine driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him to his peer at Škoda, which sometimes seems like his exhaust is clogged with a cloth, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not very popular.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with the 1400s gasoline engine in the amount of 3,299,000 crowns is still up.
With our engine, it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car beats again with 80000 crowns in addition to the beech.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper trigger, electric window lifters rear and...
Thus, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
That’s a lot, but once you count the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you’ll arrive at a very similar sum.
The only question remains to decide which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools fails
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is rising, creating fears among locals about the further development of the local school system.
So far, the integration of Eastern Europeans has encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even note cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original residents increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case of North Kent, where conflicts between locals and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Discussions, harassment, and riots among students have been linked to relationships between parents.
The situation has evolved so far that police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended herself by saying that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
Police had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant even after an attack by two minor girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bush and spit on us.
When I told him to stop, he threw us with apples and pears and then unveiled his buttocks," a mother of Slovak students described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even described the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned testify that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the UK, there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for a job.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will come true if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and delightful cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find this in abundance.
On one island, however, you can find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or passing camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed from America and then transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise buildings grew, over the wide boulevards riding cars, which were one of the worship symbols of the fifties of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Coímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
The bar at the Hotel Nacional offers cocktails as desired.
And the cult cars of the fifties run around in Havana to this day, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats have long since fallen apart in the salt and wet air.
Havana, especially its oldest part, has fallen strongly, nowhere you can find so many wonderful colonial sights in the vicinity as right here.
Other places are being cleaned out, for example Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism brings much needed money, there was a green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, there have been new hotels not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marotte that is unique in the world and especially attracts railway lovers.
The sugar cane from remote plantations brought steam and narrow tracks to the sugar factories.
Their fleet has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see clean and fully functioning locomotives whose peers have long been in the museum elsewhere.
Excursion destinations
The most important places are not ignored by the majority of Cuban visitors.
So you don’t have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
Only to mention is that in Hemingway’s previously mentioned estate there is a museum whose visit the one who likes this writer should not be missed.
The Viñales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The lush vegetation grows on lime soil.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and rocks, protrude steeply from the valley bottom, in their cavities accumulated fertile soil, by which also weathered rock areas are covered by dense growth.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.
It may also seem interesting to some that the Chilean episode of the television series "Major Zeman" was filmed there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Glory and wealth brought her the trade of slaves and sugar.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty of the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fifties of the last century that would have connected the area with the rest of the land.
This isolation helped to keep it unaware.
Nothing was built there, but nothing was demolished, everyone was happy that they had a roof over their heads.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the "Valley of Sugar Factorys".
In the evening you should then go to the Casa de la Música, which revives after the darkness, and where the music does not quiet until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba, some call it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads leading from Guantánamo must overcome high and crisp mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human intervention.
Thanks to the untouched nature of this eastern forepost of Cuba, UNESCO included it in its World Heritage List.
There is the best chocolate made, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it is about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present hotel El Castillo, stands, you can see several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pig bay and the island of Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves profess, you could write about all these many pages.
But, as you say, it’s better to look with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans claim.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States, according to the United States, the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should, according to Defense Minister Robert Gates, draft a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not run according to their ideas, as the representatives of the countries that deployed units in the south of the country agreed in Scotland’s Edinburgh.
In addition to the growing opposition on the part of the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Minister of Defense Robert Gates, called on NATO units to increase activity, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
“In Afghanistan, progress is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the residents to start a development of the economy and security themselves,” British Defense Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest level in five years, according to the American army.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27% compared to the previous year, even by sixty percent in the southern province of Helmand.
NATO countries have deployed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute border in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are calling for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and how we can achieve them,” Gates said.
The same was said by NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop.
“I’m not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan on land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that’s too little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the conclusion of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months there has been a dispute among the countries involved as to whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, Germany was criticized for passivity.
“The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country,” Gates said.
The British bulletin newspaper "Sun" this week described the German soldiers as lazy furs.
"Afghanistan non-state uncovered: the Germans do games while our guys fight," the Sun wrote in a post, supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild newspaper went over to counter-attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
Each Czech is indebted to 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kones this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to better development of state budgetary policy.
By the end of September, the Czech Republic’s public debt rose to 842.7 billion Crowns.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its information on public debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech is indebted to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state was indebted by more than 111 billion crowns.
"To date, it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may not cross the limit of one trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year’s debt is expected to move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, server iHNed.cz.
Vladimír Pikora, analyst at Next Finance, says: “We could exceed one trillion in 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If it turns out that the situation is changing on the political stage, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could take until 2010.
But I don’t assume such a change,” he noted.
Debt Growth
The state debt stems from the debts of the state government and comes primarily from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The public debt is financed through treasury statements, government bonds, direct bonds or, for example, European Investment Bank bonds.
Domestic government debt has now risen to 719.4 billion crowns this year.
The state’s foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached <0xC2><0xA3>803.3 billion at the end of September and has declined by <0xC2><0xA3>13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
Overall debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot given how well the economy is doing.
It is interesting that the growth is mostly recorded in debt bonds, where the growth is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debts are rising, but on the other hand, this shows that something can be done even before pension reform comes,” Pikora said in a statement.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing strategy and dealing with public debt shows that the government had planned to raise 159.2 billion crowns for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion krones thanks to better development of state budgetary policy.
This amount stems mainly from the state budget deficit, which this year will obviously reach 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, the maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency amounts to 13.3 billion krones, a ten-billion reserve to pay pensions, the financing of government bonds of 43 billion and rates for bonds to the European Investment Bank amounting to 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a teddy bear, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who was charged with insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening to 15 days in prison and subsequent expulsion.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give a teddy bear the name of Muhammad, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She deserved to be whipped.
After parents of students complained several times to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary school teacher, who worked at Unity High School in Khartoum, was taken home on Sunday and accused of insulting Islam according to Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter begins in September when the teacher asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class teddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, as the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image title My Name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not carry a sign with this name, but the problem is quite simple that the depiction of the Islamic prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knows her well and she would never have done anything that could make her too close to a religious belief; I only regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, he thinks this is just an innocent mistake.
A view shared by numerous students of the teacher, who describe her as being very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks about religion in the classroom.
Keep in mind that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given second name in the UK, for which there are 14 different spellings in English.
This name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered a kind of honour to the Prophet (often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo have concluded a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status, European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner urged Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their commitments to maintain peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No acts of violence are expected in the near future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added, suggesting that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, which unites the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet for the last time in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika last August had received the UN’s mandate for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation mandate to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia has been and will remain advocates of a negotiated solution, a mutually agreed solution, Botsane-Kharchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been managed by the United Nations for eight years, the Western countries consider independence under EU supervision the only solution with a future.
Pristina is willing to announce them unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in their favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been the last chance since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his regrets.
However, he added that the Belgrade proposed plan for autonomy belongs to a past that has led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic, for his part, was of the view that a compromise should always be pursued, warning the Albanian majority from Kosovo of the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it especially has a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be made solely in the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the ranks of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations took two years.
They must end the way they started: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied to the journalists that the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word regarding status, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence will be conducted by the Albanian-speaking population in coordination with the Western countries.
Bush unlocks agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had gathered under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he could to help them sign a peace treaty before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must stop its colonization work, Bush said, reminding the two parties of their commitments to the roadmap for peace that they agreed on in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities under Abbas ultimately seek a peace treaty to clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This designation includes the three serious problems mainly turning around the disputes between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of the Arab refugees who were expelled from their homeland in the current state of Israel in the wake of the 1948 conflict.
According to the U.S. President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide a settlement for all points, including listing Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he undertook that the upcoming ceasefire negotiations should be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would endeavour to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states, one Palestinian and one Israeli, which persist side by side, by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has disclosed that it has received an assurance in that sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has launched a plan adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories that had been occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a divide in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, said the Saudi Arabian prince in his interview with the Arab-speaking daily newspaper financed by Saudi funds.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors face each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the National Police Disciplinary Authority (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., a police car drove on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He didn’t have a mission, but was on strike, and drove at 40-50 km/h, without blue light, a police spokesman explained.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without license, i.e. not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, hit at very high speed.
It struck the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its advance from the right, a police officer continued.
The alcohol control carried out by the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the carriage (beined wing, split windshield, ripped bumper) testifies to the acuity of the impact.
Very quickly, even yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she entrusted an investigation to the IGPN on the "facts of involuntary personal murder and lack of assistance to people at risk", in coordination with the main department of public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor declared that she excludes the responsibility of police officers at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard Sunday evening, confirmed the police version, namely that this small motorcycle reached their left relatively quickly.
Yesterday some sort of grooves, certainly caused by the friction of the foot rails on the floor, showed that the two vehicles had stayed interlocked until the police managed to brake.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical examination.
The bodies of the two victims were obduced yesterday.
What happened afterwards?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round that the police would have left the scene very quickly, and that without providing help to the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also rule out any serious mistakes concerning this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires further investigations, and with which one has to take very care.
Liberation hit an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a fully upset police officer boiling.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth on the phone.
Given the tension that had rapidly formed around the event and, it seems, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the youth, the policemen were taken with them by colleagues who arrived at the accident site.
According to this testimony, the rescue personnel arrived about twenty minutes after the police departed.
They also used heart massages, but in vain.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police did not help the youth.
First aid was provided to these young people.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor emphasized.
The tension in Pakistan is rising
On Monday, Pakistani police destroyed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf had proclaimed emergency status two days earlier.
According to witnesses, in the city of Lahore in the eastern part of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated against the measures taken in the context of the emergency situation had been injured by the tear gas grenades that the law enforcement forces used there.
They then threw stones and wounded the policemen.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily detained.
Similar scenarios occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily detained.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court’s attorneys have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of oppositionists, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning the streets leading to the Supreme Court had been locked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had occurred in Multan (middle) and in Peshawar (northeast).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who opposed the state of emergency, and to the waste that made an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf’s promise is no longer valid
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is directly affected by the special measure declared Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to take a position on the legality of President Musharraf’s re-election in a direct round of elections on October 6.
The Chairman of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and replaced.
All that we represent is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise to give the command over the army and become a civilian president has not been valid since the call for the emergency state, Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to put off his military uniform until November 15, when his first term as president ends.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied the persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army commander.
More than a third of pregnancies are not planned.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law that allowed contraception in France, one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pill or the spiral still have a 5-6% failure rate.
According to the institute, which finds that the percentage of 20- to 40-year-old pill users who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of contraception has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
Nowadays, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
For one in five couples, even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season when it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar panel that is essential for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A daring exit that has achieved several records due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools designed by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday when astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the spacecraft Discovery, a large cylindrical part that will soon include European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
So the crew’s second task was to implement a 17.5-tonne power generation module via solar panels that was already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew went on to restructure the solar panels of the module, whose length is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors, which can be folded up like accordiones, was damaged by a clogged cable about a meter long.
The restructuring was stopped so as not to damage the collector further.
Astronauts, who originally left the Discovery spacecraft for a control process and then repaired another solar panel whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meter long remotely controlled arm of the spacecraft on which the station had been attached to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skilled, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
Thus, the 46-year-old trained doctor was chosen to operate the injured solar panel.
After thoroughly checking the damage, he cut through the defective cable and attached some sort of rail to the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker, who remained near the lock, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini hockey club, wrapped with an insulator to prevent an electrical blow on the solar panels that produce several hundred volts, the astronauts on board the station had invented and crafted.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the spacecraft Discovery to start their return flight to Earth on Wednesday.
EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
After the aviation and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to counteract the remainder of the A400M, the share EADS is currently showing a significant decline on the Paris stock exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again referring to the residues caused by the slowly progressing development of the A400M engine, which delayed the plane’s virgin flight.
The costs announced in October to offset the delay in the delivery of their military transport aircraft amount to between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus, the parent company of European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results on Thursday, he added without further details.
The group also states that the estimation of the new costs is related to the six-month residue.
To recall, EADS's business performance decreased by 86% in 2006, mainly due to the delay of another program, that of the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting to count the urns: the masses of Russians will choose President Putin’s party, United Russia.
After a very closed election campaign, she confirms her pursuit of stability, even authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending a message broadcast on public broadcasts to voters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Cremlian party, for which he announces an overwhelming victory.
Yesterday, when he received the foreign ambassadors, the president did not let anything go through, and was satisfied with delivering a new point of attack against the Western powers accused of interference – his favorite topic during the campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without scams, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have lost themselves.
It denounces an oppressed election campaign.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziouganov says there had never been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstration, his lawyer continues to ban visits.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two far-reaching questions arise:
Who will succeed Putin as President?
The official newspaper yesterday announced the date of the first round of presidential elections, March 2, 2008; the candidates have time until December 23 to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive mandate.
And now there is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the Parliamentary Majority and the Almighty Party United Russia, who will choose the government and president?
Whatever it may be, in the parliamentary or in the presidential elections, the current power will triumph.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not masters of their fate, says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: bourgeois society has evolved very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has again linked to the model of a paternalist state, which was fully accepted by the population, all the more because this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians willingly waive the personal responsibility they briefly revealed after the disintegration of the USSR.
Why do you think about it?
This phenomenon affects all layers of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite knows how to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local election lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equivalent to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In that sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednichenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you still think about it?
Those who are in power are not so bad why they replace them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, Bad Arolsen’s Nazi archives, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are housed in Bad Arolsen over a total length of 27 km, could not be viewed until now unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and named, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his relatives.
The eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the US, agreed in May 2006 to make it accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Delicate information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research to be conducted, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Meistern, head of these archives, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were against making these named documents available to the public, due to the delicate nature of certain information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The detainee lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
Nothing can be expected to be fundamentally new in these documents, explained Dr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s most important trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India’s first trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will enormously advance the two economies and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million wealthy Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe forms the first or second market for the ten most exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. The Asian and European giants exchange annually goods worth €47 billion and services worth €10 billion, the Delhi Ministry's diplomatic committee, Manuele Smadja, chairman of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, had declared this week, and regretted that mutual trade has not yet exploited its potential in India.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday expressed concern about curbing the current recurring concern about credit conditions and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an unusual term offer.
In order to mitigate the fears that financial market conditions will be particularly tough at the end of the year, and to give the banks a greater certainty of how to organize their liquidity positions during this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its savings deposits during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open-market.
The bank further declares that this way 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be brought into circulation on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, at the property tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time the BoE has put liquidity in circulation in an open market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its notice that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the daily-different interest rates of interbank loans with its basic interest rate.
Different interbank interest rates on Wednesday were 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has fallen to 6.6%, slightly higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums brought into circulation by the Bank of England have been coupled with penalty fees that had prevented the banks from using them.
According to some rumors, increased by the development of the pound price as opposed to the euro, many preferred to sign for the sums brought into circulation by the European Central Bank at more advantageous rates and with more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS’s proposals on purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text produced by a socialist niche (session on the initiative of a parliamentary group) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, most of them 50% floating on the employment allowance, the reintroduction of the TIPP, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After UMP and NC had voted against the review of the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered a partially heavy exchange of words between majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s television post on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will introduce all of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of finances that had been reviewed by the assembly last week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who has served, no more and no less, as a model for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones of C3 told Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August at a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The head of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the producers of the world’s most prestigious festivals.
In 1989, he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival at Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, has also taken care of the production, licensing concessions and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, who describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event he’s ever been attending, says his company and Melvin Benn’s company are working parallel to offer the area a European-style festival event.
We have chosen Philadelphia as the marketplace and are working eagerly with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in Philadelphia city centre, says Charlie Jones.
We negotiated the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in political debates regarding the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are making preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population.”
C3 Presents has brought Lollapalooza Festival back to life in 2005 at Grand Park Chicago, after it was created in the world of the festival in 2002, along with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events generated $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross tax revenues in 2007.
These two festivals are held in a urban environment.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a rural festival, whereas ours is more likely to take place on urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
“The goal is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, to simultaneously convey the impression of a rural festival to the European and a urban one in the American way.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden of this event with pleasure,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but he confirms "that they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival's recording capacity is "very large", corresponding to about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations have been sent to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
“Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” says Charlie Jones.
His partners for C3, who won the top independent promoter award for the latest Bollboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It’s not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the Terminator stands against it.
These lock attempts are among the delegate tasks.
A politically "heavy mandate" because California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounced "Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "governor"?
“You have to be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those you think are the best,” he says.
Running to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the advancement of the cinema there is at the moment a top priority.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all festivals on the west coast, although that of Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing the films from Quebec, evaluating them and making sure that the producers give interviews.
The Dark Age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and will be unveiled at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Does the stock market ahead of a final year rally? Disagreement among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With nearly five weeks to the annual stock market accounts, investors are already rubbing their hands in view of the upcoming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, the experts cannot make safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically, the month of December is usually accompanied by positive market developments
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to make forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially not when serious tensions to be taken determine the current market developments
Although other experts do not endorse such a strong price rise in the last weeks of the year, they note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participants, which invest primarily in pension funds due to the lack of secure equity funds, which is heavily affected by the upward-value trend towards profitable assets.
Accordingly, according to these experts, the stock market will have a more lateral trend influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the U.S. central bank’s interest rate, an uncertainty that is due mainly to the rise in crude oil prices and the risk of rising inflation rates.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a daring time to announce an upcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak mark on November 8 of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully conclude the year with nearly 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional subsidies made to the pension fund every year at this time.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasizes that this year things could develop somewhat differently, especially because of the final year rally already taking place in the second week of December, and therefore immediately after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyst at Bank Inversis, the previous assessments of the market situation are at a near-technical level, which could lead to a deviation from the index values, whose extent depends on the consequences of the U.S. mortgage market crisis.
The analyst is confident that they are positive.
Analysts agree when selecting the values to advance the Ibex to new levels.
Solana of Intermoney affirms that this year the big values are on her turn.
Among the value winners, the expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha of Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be accompanied by the banking and industrial sectors.
If the rally actually happens, real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACS has been on track in recent months and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path, the expert said.
In terms of increased consumption behavior during Christmas days, in the last half of the year periodic consumption will determine market events.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive revenue results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
Over the past seven years, December has only shown a decline in two cases.
When the technology bubble broke out at the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange out of its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end-year rally so far.
This year, when the Ibex 35 scored 28.17 percentage points, December showed a price rise of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will be the fifth winning year in a row (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and will also show a final year rally.
Popular will have its 200 credit institutions open from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically active regions of Spain.
For the institute operating under the brand name Popular Max, these branches are a major milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutes, as Popular represents as the first banking group the leap to extend the opening hours of its branches weekdays to 20.30h and set on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The banking group BBVA, which has also repeatedly reported the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet made a definitive decision.
The Bank’s currently ongoing negotiations with the trade unions seem to aim to reach an agreement in which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for this on one weekday afternoon, although not for the client.
Whether other banks will join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening hours, will depend on the experience values of the Popular Bank.
And this is also the intention that Popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their location, can capture the lush customer base of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large department stores.
The Bank intends to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new, but changing opening hours.
For this purpose, the bank will redesign the premises of those branches already located in business zones, while simultaneously aligning them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of opening hours is combined with a new room design of the branches, which is characterized by a more current, colourful design.
The responsible bank representative Ángel Rivera assures that the restructuring did not require major investments, but was accompanied by an increased recruitment of personnel, as a branch now needed no more six, but eight or nine employees.
The branches, which will even be equipped with additional premises for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experiences were positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a wise decision.
Popular currently runs about 2,500 branches.
And another 60, which operate under the name Mundocredit, are specialized in immigrants and also have extended opening hours, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax branches, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will instead offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale.
We do not want to be a competitor for our customers, explains Rivero.
With Telefonica, they have reached a provisional agreement to sell mobile phones with the help of external bank staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock value for the first time and thus exceeds its rival Antena 3.
We've done it.
With this sentence, Telecinco’s managing director, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock market. The broadcaster he led had increased its value by twice as much as his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that’s exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses this year to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company’s value now reaches 4,488.88 million euros, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento holding only 13%.
Rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January, so its market value at 2,193.46 million is half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies increased to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (editor of the magazine Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that they are two similar companies, according to Vasile.
It is still uncertain to what extent we can actually operate on the exchange, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at the customer level.
Telecinco announced a week ago its plan to become the first television station this year with more than 1 billion gross revenue from advertising, insured Guiseppe Tringali, managing director of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million of the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exchange (up to 734.4 million), while net revenue from the television business only increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco’s better stock market history compared to the current high payout ratio, which the company was able to achieve: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría prompted a 100% dividend distribution.
Vasile assures, however, that after the purchase of 33% of Endemol’s shares, with Mediaset as parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay out at least 50% of the shares, even if we have always indicated significantly more so far.
I hope we can satisfy our shareholders this year whose share values we have already increased by buying 33% of the Endemol shares.
According to analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its profits at Telecinco by 4% this year and by 7% in 2009.
This is the result of the reduction of the expected growth rate, which will decline from 10.5% in 2008 to 8.4% and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and by 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
One.
Ibersecurities: relies on its high effective return and sustained potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
Two.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (buying) measures a more advantageous position at Antena 3 due to multiple incentives and the prosperous market.
Three.
JPMorgan: Recommends reset expectations in both cases given similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
Congress approves the MIFID directive, which entered into force on November 1.
Parallel to the parliamentary preparation, which today ended its meeting with the Congress decision in the Senate on the proposals related to the project, the government published the provisions that emerge from the new law, with the intention of enabling the entry into force of both regulations by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congressional and Senate Members, who had pursued in their negotiations and votes the goal of establishing the best possible regulation that guarantees the safety of investors and regulates the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market development.
In addition to the modernization of the financial markets, the MIFID, which revises the Investment Services Regulations, is seeking to improve the protection of investors, increase the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables both specialized companies and natural or legal entities to offer financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS), the advisory firms that cooperate with the investment and intermediary companies of securities.
Furthermore, it expands the number of systems for the execution of financial transactions so that the regulatory markets are added to the multilateral systems of effects trading and the systems for the internationalization of trading orders, which would eventually compete with current economic operators.
The law requires investment companies to disclose the priorities of their company profile, confrontation and ways of handling risks in the market and to register all operations carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control.
The Congressional Economic Commission proposed further changes, with the decision that titled bonds must now be considered complex funds for the investor because of their high risk level has been confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis.
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the Legal Limitation of the Work Areas of Diplomate Economists was used; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation, which restricted the Work Areas reserved for Economists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, identified new positions in the financial sector, such as that of the economic mediator, who works on a foreign account, does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services to commercialize products and to attract customers at the same time to several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (IPC) rose five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the rate of inflation within the European Union provides the average price trend in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare the location and quality of U.S. products through the disclosure of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be prepared early by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that was not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) warned that the preliminary indicator only serves as a guideline and therefore does not have to match the final outcome announced on 14 December.
Consumer Price Index (IPC) will remain at a relatively high level
Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes said the rise in the IPC in November was a temporary development, while he assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
Nevertheless, Solbes noted in the halls of the congressional building that even though the current number is not good, Spain’s inflation difference with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less equal in recent years.
He also said there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high rise.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economy and Finance announced in light of today’s forecast.
Virgin calculates Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
Northern Rock’s stocks have declined by more than half after the bank had requested an emergency loan due to a crisis in mid-September last year, and are now only <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (equivalent to €16,800 million).
At that time, the bank’s assets amounted to record <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a sum that has decreased considerably within two and a half months due to the loss of customer confidence and also despite the government’s 100% guarantee that the money is safe, it will continue to decline until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would continue the group after its acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, will have to bring about a quarter of the income of the British banks that will be composed there from the investments in the next three years to acquire exactly the 18 billion pounds needed to achieve its 30 billion goal.
The group of multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 million (about €70 million) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week, Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged participation in urban corruption
The Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the municipality of Murcia this morning, due to the urgent suspicion of involvement in urban corruption that was uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently deputy of the Partido Popular and at the time chairman of the municipal council of Totana, last May, and could be the original drafter of the plot, according to the broadcaster Cadena SER.
Officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of being the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered earlier this week.
According to information from Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales, was arrested when leaving the residence of his client because of important stressful documents that are intended to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information relate to the alleged payments of Morales orders to a Galician construction company, which envisaged the conclusion of a urban construction contract that decided to build a 200 hectares of land.
Currently, eight people are in custody.
Bono agrees to accept the candidature of the PSOE in Toledo and, in case of election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the proposal of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to lead the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a victory of the Socialists, to assume the position of President of Congress.
José Blanco, Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, and Bono announced this at the press conference after today a meeting with Zapatero took place at the party’s headquarters.
In his view, the offer to the former minister is justified because it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
Furthermore, the Mancha-born politician would appear to be chairman of the Congress in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who had announced on November 15 that he would no longer compete in the upcoming general elections, end his career in public policy and instead engage in the university field of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the president of the government had continually pushed for his return to political events.
Furthermore, he pointed out that the party, as in the appointment of the Vice President for Economic Affairs, does not want to deny the citizens who would take the position of Congressional President in the event of an election victory, and described this as an act of transparency.
If he actually takes office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not of insult or screaming, in order to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, we get the impression that the only place in Madrid where you can’t talk is Congress; so the President of the government in the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to make it appear that he had already taken office, otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since the climate debate is criticizing both the sceptics of climate change and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront, the movement as a whole must show strong cohesion.
Especially if it is a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal puts him in a declaration need regarding his government’s action, or non-action, which has helped decisively to make Spain in the EU the lead of the countries that have fulfilled the Kyoto Protocol’s requirements the least.
Who are the responsible for failing to comply with the requirements to which sectors this is due, and why his government, which had proposed the treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he is now forced to inform the Spanish citizens of the measures he envisages against climate change.
Which companies will be affected, what citizens’ behaviour should be changed, what individual and collective austerity measures need to be implemented, and what economic consequences it will have.
More specifically, who has to sacrifice and will pay for the planet’s rescue.
However, there is and will not be any such explanation in the future.
It’s because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
Because the measures that can be realised against climate change are unpopular.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE seemed so strategically dangerous that Zapatero was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Consequently, it is now necessary to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty proverbs, without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet, the politician who is otherwise so suitable for election campaigns does not have to speak, accuse or demand, but instead pursue the demanding issue of embellishing the meetings and encouraging others with his gentleness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and therefore does not pretend that the bike will become the only means of transportation in the future or we can only refresh ourselves with a compartment.
The mayor and the police chief of Totana due to alleged involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the Murcia-belonging town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, and the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor’s office and a hotel operator have been arrested for alleged urban violations, according to investigation.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and in whose premises he is until now, surrounded by numerous agents who had also arrived at the municipal administration and the municipal construction management of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the searches already taken place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in which it turned out that more than 2 million hectares of unexploited construction ground for urban projects under the guidance of the Galician construction company Nuaria were to be rebuilt illegally.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation initiated and carried out by the first court of Totona.
The first six arrested have been brought before the judge today.
According to investigative circles, it is also being investigated against the former Mayor of Totana and the current independent PP MP Juan Morales.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, residing in Murcia, are suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo Manuel N.A., was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the managing director of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company acts as a subgroup of Nuaria and is supposed to have received the lubrication money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives carried out 11 further searches in addition to the arrests, most of them in companies that were directly related to those carried out in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding industry, who is said to have acted as a middleman.
The Nuaria group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex of the Murcia-belonging village, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of space in Totana, which was to be rebuilt, with the aim of carrying out a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonouar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates the parking lots of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and that of Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activities are limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, which specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
One.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression Book of the Month and instead try to invent a prize name with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to submit your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (Finland is, by the way, at the head of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18; randomly on that day whose issue contained the criticism of the book of Blackburn.
The content of the subject philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a graduate who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the chairman of the Education Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, urged teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and proposed to remove Plato’s teaching from the sub-stage curricula for the subject philosophy at high schools.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law, which would be detained for six months.
However, if you steal a music business under a value of 400 euros again, this is only considered a simple violation (Article 623.1).
If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, the theft is classified as a criminal offence, yet the penalty is lower than a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than for a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious clash entails a prison sentence of three to 12 months (Article 154 Criminal Code), while data exchange entails a prison detention of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. Trade in copyrighted films not authorized by the authors is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic films to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague is right, then someone has screwed up his demands quite a bit.

My physician gives me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings resulting from the monthly salary are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was prepared using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last edition of Science magazine Science.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his co-player failed.
The researchers were able to realize that brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were correct with their response and thus received the same amount; but if one of them received double, there was also greater brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually takes so much scientific effort to reach such a finding.
The prosecutor from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly hunting for the criminals of the Balkan Wars for eight years. Her office is located in the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and a laughing eye as the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre – which killed eight thousand Bosnian Muslims – namely former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbo-Bosnish leader Radovan Karadzic are still on their free foot.
Their names are on the list of Swiss-born director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary film La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet launched in Spain); a film that, at the pace of a political thriller, is following the Swiss prosecutor’s network from Belgrade to New York in their plans to track down the escaped criminals and the government.
Which insurance is best for me?
The car insurance covering a possible damage caused by the driver involves a high cost, the amount of which depends on various factors, including age, gender, time of issuance of the driver’s license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the right car insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, we have to be clear about what we have to do here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement is entered into in writing by means of an insurance contract which establishes that the company receives the insurance premium agreed and in return is obliged to provide the corresponding compensation amount in the event of a damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of creation of the driver’s license, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies set their prices in accordance with statistics, so that if a higher risk of accidents occurs, higher contributions will also be paid.
For this reason, both women and women over the age of 25 need to make less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married individuals, since they, according to the statistical values and therefore also according to the conviction of companies, tend to have fewer accidents as single individuals.
The benefit given to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the likelihood of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In setting up the premium, insurance companies must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
At this point, we list the most important points to consider when choosing insurance in order to be able to make not only a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under the age of 25 are facing numerous obstacles when choosing an affordable insurance, such as low driving practice and young driving license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance coverage to take a full-case insurance, there are still cheaper alternatives.
Cautious drivers can choose a full cash with self-employment, so that the services of a full cash insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract implies that the customer must pay a portion of the amount incurred by the damage himself.
The amount is determined prior to the conclusion of the contract and based on the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the sum to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s chief representative at First Europa, a brokerage company for online insurance.
Another option is extended insurance, which insures the customer against external accident damage, but not against damage to the own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's some advice.
If you’re under 25, it’s up to you to lower your insurance costs, so your credit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the base rate at the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in said rate.
The amount of credits and penalties will depend on the company and its income.
If the company has a high-profit year behind it, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to sign a contract, because with increasing driving practice, the accident rate is decreasing.
Thus, it is most useful to opt for a full-case insurance with self-employment.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish executive of the European company, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner was removed.
Nevertheless, it is more advisable for a married client who does not have children to take full cash insurance; of course, only if the financial situation of the person concerned allows.
Insurers consider married couples with children to be the customers with the lowest accident rate, and consequently their contributions are low.
In this case, a full cash insurance with self-employment (with an amount of around 300 euros) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which uses only for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed overall and have a greater purchasing power, which allows them to set up a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera notes.
For retirees, it is advisable to enter into a full-case insurance with self-employment (at an amount of 150 euros), or an extended insurance that only starts with a sufficiently high credit.
Ultimately, you have to note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accident damage, but also because it carries high costs that require a thorough selection to be made in accordance with our personal situation.
Celtic Glasgow hopes to reach the point for the eighth-finals in Milan
FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point they lack in San Siro next Tuesday in order to achieve their respective goals before the finish of the Champions League preliminary round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while the Scots decide on their participation.
The Italian team has already had five points and has already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to make sure that FC Shakhtar with six points won the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to compete at the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where it will fight for the first time in the 13th semi-final to enter the final, which will take place on the 16th.
Thus, this group will be finished before all others and the draw at the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the all-awaited result, even if both teams will try to win, because the Italians will not want to speculate at home, Keltik Glasgow knows that they would be first in the group in case of a victory and thus have a better starting position in the eighth-finals.
Gordon Strachan's team might be able to qualify for a loss even in a win from FC Shakhtar, but he shouldn't have too much confidence in such circumstances, because the Ukrainians have nine equal points to participate; they had lost (2-1) last week in Glasgow, but were able to win (2-0) in the second match.
Thus, the Milanes will try to lose the evening to the Scots. They hope again to reach the eighth-finals of the redesigned Champions League for the second time in a row, after winning in the next season in exactly the same round through a goal of Kaka in the aftermath (1-0) and by a zero-zero draw in the round.
While FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on their own game, as both the achievement of the eighth-final and their membership of the UEFA depend on their victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
Despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win third place and thus play at UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
The Spice Girls launched their first tour after the band was disbanded in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, in the eyes of 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before the start of their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the mood of the band was renewed.
Around the 20,000 people were able to watch the concert in the sold-out stadium, which showed a video of the band’s history, which had caused furore at the end of the 1990s.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two new songs, headlines and voodoo, which will be released in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on stage, which had previously been given to them by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowds of fans in the audience that brought the GM Palace to light, although the nerves of his spouse Victoria had forbidden him in the previous days.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham told us that the British star hasn’t seen our wardrobe a single time, and that’s why I’m very excited about what he will think of the performance.
Sporty Spice, whose withdrawal from the group in 1998 resulted in the dissolution of the group two years later, expressed their nervousness at a press meeting two hours before the concert.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed, that the feelings about the Spice Girls had changed.
And that’s why I thought why not; so I’m glad that I made this decision, Chisholm commented on the separation of the band that had caused it nine years ago.
The singer also stated that the disputes were resolved and that everyone was now very pleased.
Still, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
Initially, the group arrived in Vancouver, according to the report of the television station CTV on a special engine of Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received by an army of nurses.
The five have seven children together.
Following the concert in Vancouver, the band will be performing next in California, San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on December 23rd.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute arose between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
The majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) is driven through Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is monitored very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for natural gas, it will charge higher transit fees from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be charged more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in talks," Ukraine's economic minister Anatoli Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changing natural gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees [to Western Europe] over Ukraine.”
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom cut supplies to Ukraine.
This resulted in a decline in exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union’s supply.
Russia has the world’s largest gas reserves, but much of them remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom supplements its own stockpiles with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of pre-criminal registries for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said outside.
The recommendation of chief financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor was brought to Scotland in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service did not have accurate ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
But his report pointed out that other important checks were correctly carried out on a sample of five health authorities.
The chief financial inspector investigated personnel recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after an off-road car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video broadcast at the Old Bailey in October and was charged with the alleged car bombing in the UK.
The State Health Service is expected to carry out checks prior to hiring foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre-criminal records, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of the UK.
The principal auditor’s report now states, among other recommendations, that the board should seek guidelines from the criminal record extract, which assists employers in checking in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these checks in some personnel documents, they were not routinely carried out," the report said.
Black said the Scottish health agencies would follow their investigation guidelines highly prior to employment, but added: "Our report highlights areas in which the system can be improved to ensure accurate information about the number of foreign health care workers is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks in advance of the hiring of potential NHS employees.
“The report says that the NHS Scotland’s current pre-employment tests work well and it is unclear what added value the recommendations will provide,” he said.
Scottish health agencies say they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the boards would have trouble identifying those employees who are on leave indefinitely.
The investigation also found that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian had been mainly followed.
These include passport, work permit, and qualification controls.
the Scottish government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a concern for me to do this work in the face of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that best practices would be reflected in updated guidelines regarding the pre-employment checks of all employees, including those from abroad, whose release is scheduled next month.
Joy Division dominates film award ceremony
Control, the film biography about late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has won five awards at the British Independent film festivals, including for Best Film.
Awards were also awarded to actor Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and secondary actor Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was awarded Best Actress for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond actor Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for bringing the British film to the world public.
The prizes were presented at a ceremony in London’s Roundhouse.
Control follows Curti's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black-and-white film - which includes The Killers, David Bowie, and New Order - has been shot for just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
Nevertheless, he has awarded the Dutch photographer Corbijn, who is most likely to be known for the iconic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two awards - as best director and best director debut.
Rock music was the center of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer was awarded the award for Best Documentary.
The award for best actor went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenberg's London-playing Easter Promises thriller.
Ray Winstone, who stands in the reputation of playing hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award named after Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened the doors for people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He’s my guy, a great actor of his time, I’m truly honored.”
The independent film awards, known as Bifas, are selected by a group that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants for belonging to cells that planned an upcoming attack on an oil plant as well as clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-powered rapid response force to protect plants after a failed Al-Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reported that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees, according to the report, planned to kill clergy and security forces.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis striving to Iraq to join Al Qaeda militias to fight the Allied forces and the US-backed Shia Muslim government, which is considered heretic by the Hardliners among the Sunni Saudis.
Al Qaeda militias consider many clergy in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policies of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militias – accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Al Qaeda leader, to target the pro-Western Saudi government – have targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very big effort by the security forces over the past five months," a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior told state television.
The arrests also concerned a "medium cell" of 16 from Medina, aimed at advocating for "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims supporting violence against Muslims who are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial assistance to the militias.
The climate on Venus could show a glimpse of the future of the Earth
Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on orbit shows that the planet is even more like a distant twin of Earth than it was previously aware.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
The two worlds are roughly the same size and have similar planetary paths, but Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Billions of years ago, conditions on Venus would have prevailed that would have been very similar to those on Earth and could even have been inhabitable, scientists today believe.
But due to the unbreaked carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sunlight, and a slower rotation rate, Venus took a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is deprived of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which studied the plant for a year, offer a soothing look at how the Earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the physics department at the University of Oxford, one of the heads of the Venus Express Mission, said: “It becomes clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are pretty similar otherwise.”
“Our new data allows us to construct a scenario in which Venus started billions of years ago like Earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment.”
"Enriched Uranium" seized by police
One kilogram of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
Mitt Romey said he does not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential candidate ultimately agreed to stand up for a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters record video questions and submit them to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night of November 28 were as ridiculous as the Snowman, who questioned Democrats about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party, which is breaking into next year’s elections.
It is unknown, just like the producers of CNN, who supported the debate with selecting YouTube clips to be shown to the prospective candidates.
However, in the first half-hour of the debate, which was the longest devoted to a single topic, immigration was the focus.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undefeated voters to use a disc when they heard things they liked: The TV station noticed peaks of approval as the candidates strictly talked over the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Romney, who pushed himself forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tries to shake up his reputation for being cautious about illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly heavily opposed as questioners asked whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, managed to catch up on this issue.
Neither of the men has serious chances in the nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they’ve slid earlier and harder than others into the immigration gap.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates generally share the same views: tighter boundaries, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, along with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, help Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between Liberals and Christian Conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic as other issues were raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be regarded as torture.
One of the questioners asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to express the view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations in first place in a recent survey conducted in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was urged to see if Jesus would support them, he laughed at it and said Jesus was too clever to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee’s rise in Iowa falls along with Ron Paul’s recent donation successes and his applause storms in Wednesday’s debate.
These two were shot up from nothing, because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more known and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a blink on both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall in; his way out of it remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly slick.
No nobility titles seem to have been sold, no politician has paid Paris hotel bills, no extramarital toes.
But discovering that a wealthy businessman has covered up donations for the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something without which the fought Gordon Brown would have worked well.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had abstained from calling for an election, in a stupid way insulting the British intelligence by claiming that opinion polls did not influence this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly conscious president of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared Brown has evolved from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unskilled rescue of Northern Rock, a broken bank, showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have made corporate associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of personal data of 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative scandals.
A trio of retired generals started an uprising in the upper house in protest of cuts in military spending: being a minister of the armed forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour’s Secretary General (and his former executive) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means that Brown will irrevocably break off in the direction of withdrawal.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point after which they feel it is impossible to govern.
Neither people like nor trust politicians, but they usually retain their skepticism when a new troop takes office.
When it becomes clear that a Prime Minister is unlikely to improve the situation, and he doesn’t even need to be there long, this postponement is over: the public service begins to leak; the cabinet ministers begin to chat; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown’s position is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new brush.
As much as he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-in-law.
The issues with Northern Rock and taxation documents, for example, are related to decisions that Brown made as the Ministry of Finance’s chancellor.
And even if he wasn't directly involved in Blair's misfortune - as in the long "money for nobility title" investigation of political party financing - voters may assume he was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation isn't as bad as it looks.
The faults are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely deceived.
And the antidote, as painful as it may be, is to deliver what Brown’s, of course, Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid, and slightly brutal government.
The new commitment to political donations is a good example.
Abraham’s garboesque, who compares his donations to his charitable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but it was not up to him to decide.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
Watt, who says he knew of Abraham’s agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour’s chief financial trader, told about the strange donations in October.
But Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing that suggests that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after he took office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by grabbing a well-known instrument, an investigative committee on the subject - to complete the measure, by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the "teachings to be drawn out" are not very complicated.
If the law is broken, it is a matter for the police.
Apart from that, there are other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party financing.
That would require the hardline Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party fellow like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partisan facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unquestionable righteousness and solid competence.
Card sharks
Is America’s Credit Crisis Instigating the Credit Card Market?
When there is blood in the water, it is only natural that the back flanges whirl around excited.
Now that America’s real estate market is sickening, the predators are targeting the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts expect credit card losses to reach $99 billion if the risk of infection from underfunded loans spread to other forms of consumer loans.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both discount rates and expiration rates, which measure the proportion of loans, which are either non-recoverable or more than 30 days too late.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken a $1.4 billion fee from its U.S. consumer funding, partly because of the weakness of credit card holders.
It’s too early to panic.
Losses and losses are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter lapse rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in U.S. private insolvency laws in 2005 led to a sudden case of bankruptcy filings, which in turn account for a large part of the losses of kedit cards; the number of applications (and thus exit fees) would again increase whether or not the general conditions for borrowers deteriorate.
Industry also reports solid rates of payment that show how much of their debt consumers pay off each month
and the confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the stalemate in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that output volumes in 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
There are certainly direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will take up credit card debt, now that home loans are drying out.
However, card issuers look at the cash flow rather than capital values, so falling home prices do not necessarily cause a change in the credit score of the borrower.
They can even be advantageous for card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying mortgage rates decrease when the properties are less worth than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important under the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also react much faster and more flexiblely than lenders to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid revaluation of assets.
“We will not wake up one day and completely re-evaluate the loans,” says Gary Perlin, Capital One’s chief financial officer.
Even if a sudden undercovery crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable decline are much more real.
If lower home prices and a decrease in credit push America into recession, industry will undoubtedly face a more grim future.
Keep looking for these shark fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were due to be tried for their role in the fraudulent system with Enron’s former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday changed their applications to guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded innocent for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for the alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The proceedings were set forth in January.
But during a court hearing in U.S. district court Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone pleaded guilty for a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, became known in the UK in the course of extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation that began after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally filed against her in 2002 brought Fastow to the attention that he was the target of a government investigation in connection with the Enron decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims they came to Houston in 2000 to raise a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machines that helped tear the company into the bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its stake in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew it actually had significant value.
A company under Kopper’s control acquired the bank’s shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in this company.
According to the indictment, Fastow misrepresented to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others payed about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was guilty of conspiracy in two charges for his role in Enron's bankruptcy.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow holds a six-year prison sentence in the Louisiana Federal Prison.
Kopper is sentenced to three years and a month at a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on free foot due to a $1 million deposit, which required them to live in the United States in anticipation of prosecution.
Enron, once the nation’s seventh largest company, collapsed in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer conceal billions of debt or make weakening businesses seem profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former board chairman Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the Enron collapse.
Skilling is punished for more than 24 years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were void after he died last year for heart disease.
Not at the bottom of Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that’s little money for some of the rich Russians.
"It can accommodate up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But none of you asks for so many seats because it’s for a private family or a corporate president.”
Firer was at the Gulf streaming stand last Friday at the Millionaire’s Exhibition, a four-day orgy of showcased consumption that was hosted in a nestled exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had set up exhibition stands, hoping to interest newcomers in everything from mahogany-plated yachts to diamond-coated car grills, which would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer carefully targeted a shiny orange Porsche at the next fair stand.
"This is a nice car, but it's small cash compared to us," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.”
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be as flooded with money as Dallas was in its time of glory.
“We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to giant wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi overflyers of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most visible free-flowing issuers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in gold noise.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, attracted a conference of the luxury industry to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who have a total of $282 billion, according to Forbes’ list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires, worth $670 billion together, belong to the second class, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts of the Center for Economic and Financial Research, an expert panel here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of Russians lived under the minimum livelihood.)
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow – that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the trade fair for the first time together with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
“Women are all exemplarily cared for and men are all worth a wealth.”
As they walk through the halls on Sunday night in evening clothing, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and I’m trying to choose between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she wore, like a red carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed to target primarily the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in traffic for several hours to visit a warehouse that recklessly Cadillac Escalades, pocket knives made of platinum, Mövenpick ice cream, customized billiard tables, apartments in Dubaib.
The public was able to buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr Gijrath, who patriotically sat at a stand by Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-sized imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in Klimper-Klimpers."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-lane logos to the kind of sober brands with limited quantities that would not be marketed at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, messengers of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with sewn gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with high-end alarm systems, said his company sold the shiny orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for $170 000.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customises luxury cars to customer requests, said he had sold three car cooler grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are the same linked chain wheels, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tyre designed for a Russian casino owner, with spokes that he had covered with colored Swarovski crystals, making it look like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for a four-time replacement.
“The Russian millionaire, who wants to have oyster leather wheels or a picture of his wife’s cubic zirconium face, will not necessarily ride on these wheels,” Karapetian said.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-wagon garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in local real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you are probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
“There are more people than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at a booth operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to the British model, which were filled with mountains of fake million dollar bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his employees printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the millionaire fair.
Passants stopped to throw the money pile around, cell phone photos while sitting back in the midst of the wealth of replacement, letting friends knipse, or simply putting a few millions in.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr Karryev said.
Operation suspected of death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched as an ambulance stopped two doors down West Scott Avenue at the white Cape Cod.
Soon after, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
“Then I saw the box truck of the physician’s body examiner approach,” Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, said on Wednesday.
“That was the point when I knew someone died.”
The police heard that the dead Mrs. Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the Director of the Newarker Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure conducted by an unauthorized, cosmetic surgeon whom the police did not identify and who worked at the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
Authorities have not yet determined what caused Mrs. Arroyo’s death, and are hopeful that toxocological investigations, whose results may not be available for weeks, will help unravel a mysterious death that sent a mourning through the head of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and persistent," McCarthy said in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my pitbull.
She protected me.”
McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for Union County Attorney Theodore J. Romankov, said investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
“That’s one of the possibilities,” Mrs. Walsh said.
“It’s an ongoing investigation.”
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 a.m. in the afternoon of November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn’t want to tell if Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro’s house, where a dried rose bush stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel labeled "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hanging from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him get through the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
“She said, ‘You have to pay attention to this or that,’” he said.
“She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the central bank will lower interest rates will lead to rise in global stock markets
Stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the central bank will try to calm down credit markets by further interest rate cuts were strengthened by calming comments by the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
Stock markets rose in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, chairman of the central bank, said policies had to respond "flexibly and pragmatically" to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear endeavour to calm down deadly markets, in the face of signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said the recent turbulences “have partly reversed some of the improvements in market functioning from late September and October.”
If the increased turbulence persists, it would increase the possibility of further tightening of financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and stabilize credit conditions with new capital injections into the US markets and possible further interest rate reductions.
The remarks also helped reassure Wall Street, in the face of further bad news from the US economy, now that US real estate sales reached a new record low in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were stressed by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of its global workers, in a cost-cutting measure to offset severe losses from their lost bets in the U.S. mortgage sector.
Only 20 of these positions in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people, are expected to disappear.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the broader-scale S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of UK standard values.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Previously, the re-emerging of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after strong demand for a three-month European Central Bank guarantee funds granted to the European Trade Banks were granted at a substantial 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure to follow the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to feed further capital into London’s money markets increased as credit tensions saw the three-month “Libor” rates for leasing between UK banks rise at 6.59 percent at their peak since late September, following a continuous increase since November 21.
England faces decision on statements by Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to be number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the election, on call at least under this particular title, is here to help the head coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide on it, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director, gradually fills with applications for national voters, if not part-time.
Anyone who doesn’t get the sixth position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It is never easy to nail precisely what allows a person to reach the top of his profession, while someone else never goes beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It’s not just in cricket, where selection is difficult, where judgments are needed, which are always subjective in the end.
Is it the right time to climb Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young executives with good degrees who know the business well, should be promoted.
Who can tell what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but chances have that too.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain’s eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a batter must get regular chances on the order if he wants to make an impression as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who were better last season than, for example, when James Anderson, who appears to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declares himself healthy and how the wind rolls into the nets.
Anderson took 32 top-class wickets with 33 runs each to earn a position on this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their gloss points and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
Choosing could decide the careers of both men, or maybe it doesn’t make any difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling to consolidate himself at the time, who made the breakthrough into a major test cricket player and who, despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion in the course of today’s network session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and feelings for Shah’s greater experience about Bopara’s youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22, and an excellent balance sheet against twisted bullets.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate rejection from the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to reclaim his position for the next game, seems to have taken the boost from his stroke that was still obvious in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex all-rounder has a shovel-like joy of life.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket court and his stance away from it was brought to the point when he recently overcame a four-wheel drive vehicle at an exhibition for England’s sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was pick up his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had watched this from a distance, and with enthusiasm say, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a much better field player, he boiled his mid-speed with some effect here on the fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the real art of selection.
I’m inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which doesn’t mean that Shah may not be well done if, as the Ceylon tea set suggests, he’s the one to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaeda
The first bus shipments of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operating with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now.”
They say that the Mahdi army stopped killing people,” he said, in relation to the Shia militia of the militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his forces to be put back at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominant Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local U.S.-backed militia helped drive Al Qaeda out of its bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a hand grenades attack after he had asked his fellow citizens to fight Al Qaeda.
He had come back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and that of my boys.
That’s why I returned today,” said Sabaah Alu Obedi, 62.
Many said they had been attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since the U.S. military increase and the growth of local “groups affected citizens,” who armed and in cooperation with the U.S. military defend their neighborhoods.
But more talked about having been forced home due to visa issues and lacking funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-time father, expressed general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, had requested the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions for refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled the sectarian death squads in the country.
“We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government urged Iraqis to no longer give visas to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni retiree said.
“I can’t trust a government supporting the criminals who burned my house after I left.”
Part of the reason for the decline of violence is that Sunnis were expelled from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have diminished.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will regain sectarian tensions and conflicts.
Little Saarland, good education
The smallest state is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in an educational field, the Saarland countries exert the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-Saarlander for the 50th time yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan posters the smallest state self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is placed in the education monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
In this way, the universities already cooperate closely with their neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies here with a double or even triple diploma.
Consequently, the proportion of foreign students is high at 15.6 percent.
However, the country’s children also bring the Saarland to higher education institutions in an above-average number – many of them without a high school degree.
“In the Saarland, the vocational education system is used,” says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at IW.
More than one in five young people acquires their qualification at a vocational school, thus the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities of combination of vocational and academic training are also comparatively strongly expanded.
Measured by the population, the equipment with dual degree programs is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of the Saarland has now committed universities to a marketing campaign for engineering science subjects.
“After the first Pisa study, we initiated a number of reforms in the general education schools,” says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced national comparison tests.
For the children to start learning sooner, the last Kita Year is free of charge - a model that other federal states are now copying.
Only future comparison studies will show whether the students' performance will improve sustainably.
In Pisa 2003, the percentage of risk students decreased from 29 percent to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as strongly as other federal states.
Bavaria expects better.
And to the disgust of the Saarlands, foreign language skills are not measured in Pisa - in this area you could otherwise score.
For the language of the neighbors is a duty in high schools - even if the Saarlands are not French.
Chávez changes the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez turned the timepieces back by half an hour in the South American country.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to the Official Journal of Venezuela, a new law sets the watches to world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez justified his decision, among other things, by the fact that the United States had imposed the world’s breakdown into time zones at full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) due to a geising affair that it would break relations with neighboring Colombia.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains the president of Colombia, he will neither maintain relations with the head of state nor with the Colombian government.
"I can't do this because of my dignity alone," said Chavez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil country have to vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
Uribe’s decision to withdraw the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia on the release of hostages was the cause of the dispute.
Uribe spit Venezuela in the face with his decision, Chávez said on Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is in the mouth too.
A new cell phone ringtone makes furore in the country: "Why no te callas" is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
He was spoken of by Spain’s King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American summit was annoyed by the left-wing populist’s constant interim calls, and was overwhelmed by him.
Germans threaten 2007 wage decrease
Despite the strong economy, German workers are forecast to lose real wage this year.
Experts named a whole bundle of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler-Stiftung, employees in 2007 could expect less real on the salary account than in the previous year.
“This is due to the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price increases in food and energy,” said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomic and Economic Research of the Bild newspaper.
New burdens could also apply to employees in the unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the "Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is right and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not be embarrassed to have to ask the federal government for loans or grants, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and oil products has driven inflation rates to the highest level in 13 years.
Overall prices rose by 3.0 percent year-on-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
Venus is more similar to Earth despite its life-threatening atmosphere than previously thought: the European spacecraft "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbulences at the poles, as they occur on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected it has flashed on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has provided evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightning on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from cloud to cloud, Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles reports in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen-Theory", lightning has created life on Earth: thunderstorms in the ocean are supposed to have stimulated reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: “If there was ever life there, it must have been in very early history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is probably hardly anything living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the devil’s twin of the earth, but she is a twin,” Russell said.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, has taken such a completely different development is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The launch of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as no spacecraft had been traveling specifically to explore this planet since the early 1990s.
The latest research, now presented in several "nature" articles, not only emphasizes the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
“They also show that the similarities of our neighboring planet with the Earth are greater than initially thought,” the Esa said.
In addition to the known wind at the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud strudel at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of airflows in the earth’s winter hemisphere, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-tiniest planet in the solar system is almost the same mass as the Earth and with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers is almost as large.
The planet, also known as the Morning or Evening Star, circles around the Sun in just 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: a Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both was accumulated water, which remained on Earth in oceans, but on which Venus was lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide on Earth is fixed in carbonate rocks, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue,” Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but she protected Merkel from the accusation that she is pursuing a new China policy.
“The Chancellor has not distanced from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had expressed indirect dismay over the reception of the Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked by the Union.
Steinmeier had complained, among other things, of the Union’s “external policy” in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's office, heavy irritation occurred in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only invited German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also froze the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries.
China’s chief Wen Jiabao has now called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the Dalai Lama’s reception as a mistake.
China rejects when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The acts and words of the Dalai Lama showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other today’s provinces, from China.
Schäuble warns of clashes as in France
Street battles with police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of clashes as in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not discharge itself into violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior said.
Barricades burned, randaliers shot the police with rifles: After the severe youth riots in France, German Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We need to make sure that social explosives do not build up and discharge into violence.
We have to take this seriously,” he said to the new press released in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities have already worked hard to mitigate problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
“From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, this already shows the first successes.”
However, it is too early for warning.
Schäuble pointed out, at the same time, that there are non-urban and sociological problems in German suburbs like in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had been fighting with the police over the past nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
However, the federal government called for greater integration efforts by the chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In the face of the clashes in France, Kolat warned of “imitation effects.”
The situation in Germany is not as brisant as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate among young people with a migratory background under the age of 25 is "above-average high".
In particular, more training places should be provided.
Kolat said: “We need to give young people a perspective.”
But the president of the Turkish community added that in Germany there is more "social control in the families" than in France.
Many teenagers with a migratory background also did not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warned, “But we still have to be careful.”
Young people must be given the opportunity to participate quickly in work and training.
Meanwhile, it remained quiet at night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning garbage bins and cars.
Since the previous day, a deployment of around 1,000 security forces has ensured rest.
Police will go through as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were injured in clashes in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the afternoon, the riots in Toulouse took place.
The riots sparked in a traffic accident that killed two young people on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor’s office, the police are not responsible for the death of the young people.
In the Kingdom of Angela Cloud
The Chancellor’s remote reality appearance documents that the coalition is at the end in terms of content – and that nothing can be expected of herself.
In which country does this Chancellor live?
After her uncomfortable appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was sorcerous and poor in content, one must say: not here - not in the country that she would finally have to rule.
The accusation of focusing too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with a very arrogant statement.
This was provincial, she said, and only showed that she does not want to understand what critics are talking about.
In the Bundestag, she documented to everyone the truth of her accusation.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a high-profile politician who flees into foreign policy and even remains in unferrous.
Example of climate protection: because it praises unrelentingly the decisions of Heiligendamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate goals in this country.
At all, the self-praise - so much impudence the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she clings to the floscles that the recovery comes in the people.
In this way, she damages her image as a pragmatician, solving problems rather than talking the world beautifully.
But in the kingdom of Angela Cloud, domestic political problems are a random appearance.
Child poverty and the worries of low-earners?
She has a few secondary sentences left for it.
It is noteworthy how often she promises herself when it comes to child supplementation.
There are three steps that Merkel needs to take to bring out a half-straight sentence.
It stumbles like a stranger’s terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have a tough strike exchange - and now they have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is cleared from the first topic.
He has made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants," Romney accuses his counterpart Rudy Giuliani.
“I would say his own house was a port for illegals,” Giuliani replies, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the Republican base still has no clear favorites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second videos that Internet users submitted via YouTube are hardly any more than keyword users.
“With this kind of isolationism, we have brought Hitler to power,” John McCain accuses his counterpart Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets strongly read by the Vietnam veteran when he refuses to condemn so-called “waterboarding,” a method of interrogation simulating drowning as torture.
However, the reactions of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the campaign’s important topics are now beyond Iraq war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium applauds.
This shows once again where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains, begging before base and television audiences that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, gets into the slingering when he is asked about his opinion on the literary interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules civilian for the first time
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was sworn in as president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for another five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he surrendered his position as army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, leaving international pressure, particularly from the US.
Eight years after his seizure of power in a bloodless military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation as Chief Commander of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a core demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency imposed by Musharraf on November 3.
Soon after his oath, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency, according to Attorney-General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thereby fulfill another demand from the West.
The country’s Supreme Court, which had occupied Musharraf after the establishment of the state of emergency at the beginning of November with weighed lawyers, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four injured in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Herb Rock Return
Germany’s Supergroup of the Seventies musiced again: The three band members of Harmonia performed their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the revival, a feature from her great time appears "Live 1974".
Even then, they were much more famous abroad.
The adorned sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen on the dinner table.
Everyone has their box in front of them, their cables and, above all, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits in a white shirt at the age of 63 in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrates on the console.
Everyone makes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally fits into a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
That the band re-musiced Harmonia has brought some excitement among herbrock lovers.
In this case, one can reveal: Targeted demands revealed that the name, although whirled through collective pop memory, but by no means was so sustained to painfully miss this band for 32 years.
But why shouldn’t the German also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Especially because what is misleadingly called herb skirt, in England and America, there was always more than in their own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life Work to the survivors of the Cologne Group Can in 2003, German pop faces were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the laudatio, the surprise knew no limits.
At concerts Michael Rother later hooked onto the stage at the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old buddy.
The problem of ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the stranger is one.
The memory is already overwhelmed with harmony, because the trio existed only for two years and during this time also developed a much lesser power of action than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar under the Berliner Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped at the power plant and subsequently gained a reputation as a guitarist at Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, Rother followed the cluster musician in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin dating back to the 16th century, they lived as city-flighting communards.
Less ideologically than in the Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to be harassed as a nanny.
Rather in an artistic lifestyle.
It was reported that there was also a wimpel of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association and a name for the art.
Some of them kept harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the next "De Luxe".
Because as calm and humble as the music sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The collection of rice was not only for self-finding.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem, in front of a record setting of almost 50 people, as someone thinks to remember.
At the time, Rother had a desire to enforce harmony and to practice it occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral demand.
The band declared their separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric spherical and assured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Clusters were revived in the eighties and have since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
The Griesemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of nurturing the skirt as its own German contribution to living music.
New! has already been excavated as Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
With which the entire range of the influences of the herb rock would be outlined on the subsequent pop music.
Harmonia fills the empty spot of the supergroup.
Brian Eno’s sentence floats with the most distinctive sounds in the hall: “The only true music, you belong to the future.”
There are pictures showing the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Legend-building is used for projections of other black-and-white photos of wire-wired equipment.
Before that, the three veterans are again dealing with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums to attract unheard sounds to the instruments via self-made effects devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technical depth.
The house’s choir doesn’t change this.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, she is coughed under sound clouds and sung in a beautiful place with emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never a rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music colleges (can), technologies (powerwork) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Anyone who calls "68!" here is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia cannot be taken out of it even now.
Even the most obvious thing is thoroughly reviewed on the stage.
Where does music begin and when does it stop?
This can rob you of the nerves or give you moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough.
"The Hunting Party" and "Morder Peace" are again dealing with the Balkan War.
Both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and shooter or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, precisely there, in the dark hinterland of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties recently, because too many nice, irrelevant roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the topic of Buddhism ejected the desire to look.
Now, Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the Hunter Becomes a Hunter" (why movie titles must always be as long and confusing as locomotive tax contracts?).
Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become if fate and the film industry weren’t so gracious: a man who has long been behind his best times, but who himself, as a ruin-like memorial of his decline, has preserved substantial remains of his former charm.
But despite this trumpet, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Mörderer Frieden", which will also launch this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian from Kosovo hedge snipers, after which one is quickly in love with her.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not once depicted as the sole root of all evil, the television flat film loses too quickly in bullets and action.
It remains a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but for this with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored in an exemplary way why there has never actually been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters coming up to track down the Serbian Upper War criminal "the Fox" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another screenwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard).
The stories are strikingly similar: both times small teams go into the forest to do something that the military cannot and both times it will be a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the fallen cynic with a heart than he's introduced to you at the beginning.
No, the script must also suggest him a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, The Hunting Party goes down the stream when the reporters in the last five minutes of time-lapse process succeed in what NATO, the CIA and all the world’s reward hunters have failed in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to fair revenge.
This is so bad that you want to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against cinema.
The film has a deeply human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (they should be exceptionally agreed here) not to persecute too intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the good meant and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet’s work table: “Compassionately I see the swollen forehead veins, implies: how exhausting it is to be evil.”
Films like "The Hunting Party" have just such swelling heads, but they suggest how exhausting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan War film.
Recently, this newspaper has reported that all Iraqi films were Hollywood’s big flops.
You can add, there has never been a good South African film.
Almost always it is true: when a star is moving around the world’s crisis flocks or mine fields, something like “Rangoon” with Patricia Arquette, “Beyond all Borders” with Angelina Jolie or “Blood Diamonds” with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to pass decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with Schindler’s list.
Some films are likely to be ripe - the Vietnam works now considered classic "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated as a single masterpiece at the time.
But perhaps we know today where every real-time mass murder comes home on just two screens, even simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the scriptwriters of the recklessness they need to tell good stories.
"Being or Not Being" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
You may not want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastically distant artist sight of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When the parallels between his historic novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan war were questioned, he replied, "This is just because some things never change.
Great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust's criticism for Olympic cancellation
The Mayor’s departure from Hamburg’s application for the Summer Olympics has faced heavy criticism in politics and business.
Many want to continue fighting for the games at the water.
But realism warns of Beust when it comes to assessing the opportunities.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, on Wednesday called a waiver "not good for the business location".
No other project has recently developed such great motivation in the city as the Olympic Idea.
“Without this goal, the sports policy boost would not be maintained to the same extent.”
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to it, "coming from a changing time beam."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in previous statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions were unrealistic by at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said von Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sportsbund expected for the beginning of December on Munich’s application for the Winter Games 2018.
“This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic chances in the period we have planned so far by 2028.”
Nevertheless, the dream is not dreamed forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted Beusts’ statements.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will no longer want to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
“It’s too early to get a chance to bury the plans already at that time,” HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is also in contradiction with the statement of the Head of the Senate on the occasion of a reception to the General Meeting of the General German Higher Education Sports Association.
There von Beust called Hamburg’s application for the 2015 Universiade “not a substitute” for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD Citizenship Fraction accused the Senate of not having used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
“The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed for years by the Senate because it has put on the Olympic map and discontinued housing construction,” SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Kleine Grasbrook has always called for integrated planning for the Olympics and later housing use, the CDU has unilaterally placed it on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg had sparked great enthusiasm at the time.
Hamburg failed at Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever combines the terms Sweden and wooden box thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Are you?
Currently, manufactured wooden boxes in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol’s works list.
Most of the ninety-four "Stockholm type" brilliant boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago raised doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of the year 1968, further internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now comes to an overwhelming conclusion: The six "Brillo boxes" which the former museum director Pontus Hultén has well-made to the Moderna Museet in 1995.
The prehistory is embedded, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first “brillo boxes” in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the soap powder “brillo” cardboard boxes.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968, with Warhol's consent, exhibited hundreds of cardboard brilliant boxes: These were not (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cartonagen factory.
They were not works of art, but their models, merely exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted permission in 1968 to produce a few brilliant wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes, which at the time were authorized as original Andy Warhol Brillo boxes with the name "Typ Stockholm" rightly entered art and auction history.
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 at auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, Hultén’s 105 boxes were not produced until 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, has also examined three of the six museum-owned Brillo boxes from Swedish private ownership, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first foundated and grounded, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, however, reveals that the paint was applied directly to the press panel with a painter roll without a primer - in addition, it is not oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will have the six boxes in its collection as a copy.
Even in July, the Authentication Board announced that it will pursue the “serious accusations” raised regarding the soap powder boxes.
Since then, however, there has been unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel troops have surrendered to a hotel in Manila, calling for the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for bloodshed, leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel.
Government loyal soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas use.
The nearly two dozen soldiers had been hiding in the building for hours.
Approximately half of them were tried on Thursday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly set off with about 30 sympathizers.
The military officers who were supposed to guard him apparently had overrun to him and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government forces shut down the district around the renowned hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
“People have enough,” said Trillanes.
“We call on people to join us.”
