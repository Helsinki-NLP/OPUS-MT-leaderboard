Parliament has not ratified the amendment for Tymosenko's release
The Ukrainian parliament has refused, as part of an amendment to criminal law, the draft annulment of the paragraph relating to the charges of opposition leader Julia Tymosenko.
MEPs refused in second reading the draft amendment to reduce penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors to freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for reaching a disadvantageous deal with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final and the court must decide on the convicted woman's appeal in December.
Tymosenko calls the regime's political vengeance judgment and has provoked a process of suspected court bias also in the west.
The proposed annulment of paragraph 365 of Criminal Law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 MEPs.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Victory in Libya
Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners remain to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but they are moderate or radical.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of the Sharia and we already know what it is about.
Libya is becoming a country without criminality because for a theft you cut your hand.
Women can forget the emancipation, the possible non-compliance of the faith are punishable with the death penalty...
It is the Qur'an that will unite the society of opposing tribes in place of the dictator's personality.
In Libya will reign such an order as we cannot represent ourselves and as we surely would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, it is not objectively the best, and it would probably not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted the help with recognition of unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who directed NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated at every attack.
So when it comes to seeking the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam and our poilitics turned away from the dictator as a political ally without bringing any profit.
After the recent poor experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
Therefore, there is no problem for locals to get rid of "cruises".
Will oil companies have easily accessed Libyan black gold without soil occupation?
Perhaps not so much and the West will eventually be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
As little as these sharia followers prevent us from doing so.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sight of investors.
A statistical tornado passed on Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states published GDP information for the 3As.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market breaks all records.
Investors are looking not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have published their visions for economic development for the third quarter earlier.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow 0.5%, while France's GDP is expected to grow 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better positioned than expected (growth of 0.3% rather than expected 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (it was a question of stagnation).
The Czech economy saw a growth of 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are moving towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts expect.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
The German economy saw a growth of 0.5% in the third quarter according to forecasted and periodically recalculated data.
The euro area and EU economy grew 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2%.
Return on 10-year bonds is 28.45%
Returns on bonds from Spain and Italy are climbing to critical limits.
Problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Returns on Czech bonds remain below 4% as the situation in the region deteriorates.
Votes are heard in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of last instance .
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football representation has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Cech and Keeper Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also dearly defended with a good share of luck in the second part of its qualification and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification for the European Championship.
The Montenegrins found themselves under pressure as far as the second part because of a precise Czech defense.
The match’s vicitmes were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football box.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
Both teams were hardly able to assemble combinations and the game focused mainly around the middle line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not reach the Czech defense, which responded accurately to the long shots even during the first half-time.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred higher school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
With this gesture, they want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the deaths of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from Isfahan universities created a human shield Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology center where uranium is transformed.
They thus expressed openly that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
It is reported in Israel a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began praying at noon in front of the site and then wished the deaths of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to destroy Iran's nuclear program, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
Feeding an obese child: Do not take breakfast and take charcuterie for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 years have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren will have a weight above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models surrounding it is.
On tables of obese children, for example, charcuterie is 50% more frequent than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner, according to survey conducted with awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a chance"
In the families of big kids, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case with most schoolchildren today - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents were finding time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place during the last school year and involved 900 students from the Czech primary schools.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a chance", action supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 sixth to third students have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the absence, proper diet and insufficient physical exercise.
"Only half of the children surveyed indicates, for example, eating breakfast 5 times a day - in case - lunch - taste - dinner, which is a basic principle of a good diet," one of the survey results said.
Without breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of student families eat at the same time.
In most families, each one eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been observed is that one-tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are consumed more often.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of children surveyed do sports regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own food from possibilities proposed according to their own taste and personal opinion.
“The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating.”
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming thing is, in particular, a high preference for sugary lemonades," the survey finds.
For lunch it is the pasta that took the first place just in front of white meat.
The children did not want starch at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Focus on health
The survey also showed that children are willing to change their habits from the moment they receive ad hoc information.
"During a survey of a group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the 'Obesity is not a chance' awareness session, a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet was assessed," the survey finds.
The most prominent was, for example, for sweet lemonades as children began to give preference to consumable water.
Children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech specialty of bread flour balls or potatoes).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In a presentation article about how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there were a lot from the beginning.
I didn’t think about what would happen later.
The presentations of three specialty professionals, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we are to the final exams, the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "drunk".
This time we have with director Alenka (during the course there are no boys) treated how to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this kind are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy’s body, with no particular curve, another overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically reduce wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We managed to nicely emphasize the character and also not to dress too vividly types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between waist and hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not pass at all, it is worth doing it tailor-made.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls flawlessly is invaluable.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that constantly slides, winds and does not hold to the belt and so on.
For those who have a male appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have the whole week to sort all the information received.
But I’m also afraid that considering what I have to do at home there will be too many.
Each trainee was given a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We need to consider the current appearance, the fashion type of the personality as well as its appearance.
I will have to "dress"Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know of the campaign the Secret of Victoria.
In my heart, it makes me happy, because it’s better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred pounds lately (please don’t take my statement completely seriously) or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search on the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the end result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Also thinking about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist thus not only dresses the physics but creates for example productive pages in magazines (on given products trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, a stylist and graphic designer, told us about all this.
But that,... until Sunday
The designer must have an overall view.
Three specialty guests gave a diverse appearance to the Saturday session filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with a single clothing in a different way.
Variability is essential for this example.
As for example this trench-coat that has to be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a lightweight coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with scarpins and take a picture like a dress.
Or just take the sleeves up or the neck and immediately have a new look.
“Play with that,” he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
“Then you can start countering it,” Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we strive to learn these rules, what to do with, what, why, whereas in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements about fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more clothing variants than those that are photographed.
That is to say, for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I have to be ready to "sweep" at least a fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.
We have to count on this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style sometimes make half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of stylists is still friulent.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seems to be goes second).
And if someone gets a styling on our part, then we have to count on the fact that they dictate us with great probability a completely different size (smaller) than the one they actually have.
Then we only have to browse google and make sure if the information on the boulevard reports the celebrity in question, whether it has lost or grown fat, etc...
On Sunday, Honza and Mario put on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient itself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to guess people, not flatter themselves, keeping their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and fill it with new items you can't throw it all out and say, 'My God, what a horror.'"
“You’ll find some stuff you’ll find beautiful and you’ll advise him with what to wear,” says Mario.
This one has shown us concretely what everything should contain what is called the "placovka" or the stylist's bag.
This is the one you hang around the waist and you have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, hair removal rollers or nursing pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which they could close a garment in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of clamp) are not stitchable.
So that we were not just people who listened but tried something practically they taught us how to look like shoes properly.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could be damaged, especially outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We were not allowed to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently hurt ourselves.
We really need skills.
Mario was delighted when he congratulated me on my creation.
The count I'm saying isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a short summary of what we learned during the second class weekend.
I begin to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed Le Run is fighting across America.
Revision
Initially a problem-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with a routine morning trip to work.
This fulfils to some extent everyone’s ambition, but it doesn’t help if no one wants to do something else.
The new subtitled game The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old racing series Need for Speed and to release a kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the passages are going to be added in which the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what we were expecting.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole shot down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught up in the adventure whose main hero Jack has characteristic problems and to solve them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
As a result, each race is done on a different route and the stages planned in different environments that differ quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also pretty even though the graphical technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very visually pleasant.
The tests are also occasionally accompanied by an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly diminishes your visibility.
Then in the mountains you need to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Besides this, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a small number, but that is enough.
There are moments you strive to exceed the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the clock (classical dual with the chronometer) and then still awaits you another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police entering the game and trying to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is out-of-vehicle passages.
This is rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by taping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer such moments than you expect (to be concrete, there are only three).
In the result, it is like this because this element is not likely to interfere and places itself, in the context described above, in the elements that embellish the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means there is nothing extraordinary right now, but it cannot be said to be negative.
For realistic simulation, you will need to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of race design.
So everything is OK.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
In contrast to the model of conduct, the collision model is not yet ready.
We do not expect from this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have, in a collision with any object, any idea of how your car behaves, so it is not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car part in crazy bumps.
Or find it in crumbs.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done in such a way that when you broke your face or you got out in the setting the game takes you back at the time of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 reboots.
When you use the 5 restarts you have to start the game again from the start.
So it’s more a tool, in case something doesn’t go right, than something you can truly count on.
Sometimes reboots don't help and you have to find the solution by remembering from memory the piece of the route in question.
The biggest thing about this game is that the same actions are in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be passed in a certain way otherwise this does not happen.
Otherwise you encounter "civil" vehicles in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or one minute late.
What makes you angry are situations when you easily see the opponent passing between two cars coming in the reverse direction and when you arrive, you have to either set aside and circumvent them or brake them.
It doesn't matter if you go to meet him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you to the same place.
This annoys the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long bridge in the reverse direction.
The opponent must go ahead of you at all costs.
When he passes in front of you, he hides the sight of other vehicles in the reverse direction and you collide a good number of times.
One can understand that the goal of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn't matter if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during the race.
You need to pay attention to gasoline pumps on the routes as you can change your car there however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large U.S. cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic atours on highly technical pipes for example on lace roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places you know about adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You will not only receive medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you reach the highest driver level, different objects begin to unlock themselves:
It connects online with the Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult strokes to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you ride in the dark on the lanes (it looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway railway that sends the car directly to the scrap.
At the writing we had a discussion for a few days as to whether someone really thought about creating this game or whether the authors really think of us as fools.
The technical part of the game is not extra,but the visual part is generally pleasant and in some cases really great.
What is annoying is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when smooth imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is to choose from.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the most young audience a new soundtrack has been created in the "I mix everything" style, but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Need for Speed: The Run is really confused.
If the game didn’t have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that it’s the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game makes it feel like it’s not finished.
The fun is really good but prepare for the faults hitting you in the eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The Velvet Students in concert with the Charles University Choirs
The Festa Academica festival offers for the third time festivities that connect the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs from high schools and secondary classes.

The program also offers high-level concerts, msical meetings, a student happening and other activities.
Interested parties will find all the information on the internet pages of the festival www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty radically suppressed balance between institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a tough war.”
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," Milena Vicenova started her presentation at the Faculty of Law, the Czech Ambassador near the European Union.
When she succeeded in describing the various EU bodies and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible manner, to the point that a large number of speakers from the Charles University Law School could envy her, she showed how much she takes her motto "comprehensible and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the outset, critics resonated that he was fade, that he was a round-of-leather, that he couldn't fill any mission and I have to say that he cut off everyone's breath because he holds his role to perfection."
“He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe.”
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who to the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", so as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater readability of the Union's policy towards the states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a success two years ago.
The Czechs resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis, or organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
It called the fall of the government very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has beaten its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved.
In addition, the new seven-year EU budget must be approved, which is becoming very complicated due to the current economic situation.
Since it seems that the budget will be slim and with a view to saving, which sector will have priority, which countries will be assisted the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a comprehensible Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted corniches, differently large bananas, or that no one has forbidden us from making syreckys."
It wants to better use the EU environment and see more Czechs in the EU institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
She is also sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, in her opinion, is due to several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a low support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what else is this group of Visegrad doing?'
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future Member States will have tough new fiscal policy rules.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not a multi-speed Europe, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area.”
“We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation.”
First, it was said that countries that want to cooperate with each other and those that do not want to remain in their corners.
"There will be a lot of such institutes and there will be a really two-speed Europe," Mrs Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all themes that have an impact on the EU must be discussed among all EU members and not only the members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If anyone was to look for the vocabulary that expresses the IBM strategy closest, the closest would be "the long term."
For a broad audience, IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has passed a hundred years.
The foundation of this long-term strategy was laid by the company’s first leader, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved for as little as people are willing to reflect.
His slogan "PENSE!" became the footprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
This was the foundation of Watson's care company culture.
For us, IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it remained true to its core values and nevertheless was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This has enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more"delayed for the birthday the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began taking care of his employees as Bata in the Czech Republic - the people at IBM were the only ones of the first American employees to have paid vacation, an employer-paid insurance plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed reward system for inventors and merchants.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at first brilliant in the discovery of talent – as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and could thus have a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman—Virginia Rometty—who should replace Palmisano at IBM’s head.
She has been working at IBM for thirty years and currently serves as Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has done what is known as jamy, brain storming online, from which a lot of future strategies and innovations have come.
It's no wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that ensures it a secure position in the field of business.
“Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the business world using its technology,” said Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is known in the United States in terms of its slogan - in 100 years it has grown to become one of the world's largest firms.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products to nanotechnology.
She holds many patents from all U.S. tech firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are, for example, the ticket machine, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the diskette.
IBM ended up this year with $220 billion as the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufacturing have been the preference of the customer and of the time - for example, IBM failed to bet on a clean OS/2 operating system, the Prodige online service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the movement ahead you can’t emotionally stay caught on the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don’t work it goes away.
Unlike the Microsoft concurrent, for example, which at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for one-fifth by software and hardware, have a predominant place.
However, still in 1990 she was with more of the participation motive the strongest hardware representative.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in prospective technologies.
It continued in investment and even from 2008, when it first surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the major economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Now it appears that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM share has prognosed from 2008 on a 120 percent rocket, the company's net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s logo is to change everything but not its values.
For this reason, we can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York City a hundred years ago; it initially had the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 80s of the nineteenth century.
They owned technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 presided over the Board of Supervisors of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then shaded the company's founder - it's on Watson's ideas that the identity and culture of society rest until now.
Watson led the Kusqu firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat cutters to the cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales increased to $9 million and began the company's expansion across the globe.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of leadership, it was his son Thomas Watson Junior who occupied the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came to the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began dealing with high value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that has succeeded at IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its goal is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet operated, such as transportation and city management.
As far as commerce is concerned, IBM recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in our territory as well.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, then the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center of Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague and there is also the research and development team at the global level that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
Only she couldn’t wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer to Bartosova in her house, she did not doubt that her couple would not stand.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer back.
And he admitted in public that he loved her.
Over time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and eventually said goodbye to her forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate, there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
“He’s my son’s biological father and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will throw him out.”
"He will no longer be my loved and lost old ass, but a man with whom I have a particular relationship," Rychtarova said, showing that she has separated herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
“My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it.”
“The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy.”
"With Darina we talk completely normally but we don't sleep together," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
“We’re not sleeping together and I’m not interested in where she’s going, with whom, and if she’s having an affair.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility on myself,” Joseph concluded.
The Worst Vices of Women: Does This Affect You Also?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all, both, are able to get them out of their sleeves.
My dear ladies, you will know in the following lines the feminine vices that are able to pump the blood from the veins of men.
The Purchases
Does your half say that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one clothing a week?
Are you happy to buy and in packages at the time of sales?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which would withstand the window lick of clothing stores, looking for nice clothes for yourself and then trying them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become for men a real hell.
Just remember how many times have you told your spouse that he is waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to lose at least 5 pounds - should I start sporting?"
"Do you like me?"
Do these sentences not remind you of something?
- Yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
The stronger sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more poisonous women become.
The odre and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, clean the floors, do the dust, strip the bathroom - and this twice a week.
Do you make any remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they dirted the sink, crashed the window in the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put this worn suit in the trash bin."
"Are you planning to put on those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this work on your partner several times a day, you’re really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you don’t think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Perhaps if men knew it, women wouldn't have to do so much work.
Defamation, persiflation
Defamation, persecution, but also insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly attached to relationships and are thus happy to deal with topics like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us lets out a little harmless persiflation here and there.
The hand on the heart is a characteristic of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persuade, even despise others and are especially dangerous for their entourage – especially at work in a collective of women.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in Philadelphia victory
Hokeyist attacker Jagr twice participated in Philadelphia’s victory during Monday’s NHL game on Caroline’s ice and is again at the top of the productive Czech players for the competition.
From the point of view of the 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the match, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
Jagr after the match told journalists from overseas that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
“I told him before the match that he would give his hat-trick.”
"I felt it."
"Sometimes that feeling falls on you," explained Jagr after his Giroux action marked a goal from the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the pallet and presented it to scorer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second game belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
“I love to play with him.”
“I don’t mean he’s the best player in the league but he’s really one of the top three,” Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I would play at the end of my career with a hokeyjist like him."
“I’m really happy about that.”
“I want to play on him.”
“All these years at the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out any other complications that ended up two to one.
“Pronger has performed excellent attacks in our area.”
"He tapped on the pallet, I picked up speed and (Read) set off to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I managed to do it," describes the last goal of the match from his point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he left second-third due to an injury in the upper body.
The Candians failed to face an experienced defender their two goal set advance lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
This is the fact that the rear line was sick which mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost fists because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"That's naughty."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young people."
“But there’s nothing to do, it’s like that,” says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement wasn't enough and we couldn't resist."
“We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area.”
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P.K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the thirtieth attack on Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated in uax Jets goals, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How Travel Prices Have Changed Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel especially in the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a western inclination and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example in Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation otherwise the individual travel was not permitted.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
Even after that, it wasn’t won yet.
The deal for currencies that was the condition for travelling to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currency (western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were consequently many country houses and cottages that the Czechs purchased and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989, Czech travel has undergone a major revolution.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at maximum, the Czechs spent abroad last year 4 million days vacation in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s in western neighbouring countries has caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not for a long time travel by air to the west that everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or pension.
The typical trait of a Czech trip at that time was to take with you your own food canned, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment has also been the interchangeability of the Czech crown which has finally allowed our tourists after decades of free buying Western currency.
Our standard of living and average wage increased, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
As a result of increasing demand for travel, travel agencies have started to prepare tours with air charter routes since 1997, which through contracts have greatly reduced costs compared to previously.
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world except the EU which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully fit into the group of developed countries.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person on vacation abroad including annexed charges.
The general assembly must find its president but this could end with an unsolved situation "one foot"
Almost five months ago, Czech football is without a president and Ivan Hasek's successor to the head of the Czech Football Association is likely not to be known after another general assembly to be held Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on the rules of procedure for voting.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football returned back to divergences between the chambers of the Association that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was completely shown on September 16 when we had to choose a new president.
General Assembly delegates gathered unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of how to elect.
There was no agreement on who was entitled to vote in the General Assembly - only statutory representatives or fully powerful officials.
In this one point there has been a partial agreement since then with the aid of the Bureau also for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue about the regulations for the election.
It is too clear that the executive committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not contributed anything to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nerve point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the foot.
"The apple of disagreement lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice presidents of the Czech Football Association Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, the third round wins the candidate who has received the most percentage votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers will win.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits, who understands the Moravian party's objections and according to whom it would be best not to change the regulations and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the settlement of elections established according to the statutes benefits the Pelta most among all candidates.
"I wish that we vote as much as possible in accordance with the statutes of the association."
"So that there will not yet be any saugrenous ideas imagined by a representative as during past general assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He says there will be a new president in Nymburk and believes that the candidates will cooperate together and constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone."
"Football will once again be on a wave of happiness and there will be more training for cooperation," adds Jablonec's officer who among the three has the greatest experience in management of both professional and regional football.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This can cause a blockade in the General Assembly again."
“I still hope that healthy reason will win,” said Rajchl.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings are expected to take place directly in Montenegro but can tell if the entire football management will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorice, among others, did not take off for technical reasons and was sought a variant to take part of the executive committee to the retaliation ground.
In the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports, Joseph Dobes, would be very pleased to receive the torn parties within the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state staffing, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidates.
If Plzen's footballer leader Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to whatever he requested for a new president of the Czech Football Association (AFRT) he would not be campaigned for this high position.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I don’t run for the election.”
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech news agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to just try to prevent Pelta from accessing the head of the AFRT which a priori would be given favorite for this election.
Paclik also emphasizes that if he won the elections he would hold this position as President only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.
He would see well in the role an experienced manager and high-level but unrelated to the world of football.
“I’ve been talking to people who would have the profile,” he said.
“For me it was terrible when some told me they didn’t want to be identified with Czech football right now.”
“I would like to change that image,” he added.
What is said to disturb Paclik is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a renowned counterfamous man who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of the delegates of the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable that Pelta occupy this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flight trader, it would be even less favorable to football," Paclik said.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta did it without any harm.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be viewed in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago, "if Pelta becomes President, I will sell the Plzen club."
In case Paclik triumphs in Thursday's vote, he should prove he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly who had ended up with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
“He has great abilities”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of representation."
"But as a manager of the association he wouldn't be able."
"I'm not putting my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik who in September caught great attention when he voted for the cancellation of the Board of Referees with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his abilities to lead private firms and he has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the First Division.
“I have the strength to make something change in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it.”
“I would hinder the influence of some interested groups that, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which leads to situations of bad taste,” said Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonizing relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power to lobby high-level policies would make it possible to get more money from gambling taxes for the sport.
“This is one of the key points that the new president should deal with.”
“If it’s about gambling tax as political parties declare, I understand their arguments but they should also say where the money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT President should be "over the parties."
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"That's not ideal."
I don’t see any reason to pass on my shares from the Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later,” Paclik said.
Pelta has pledged new statutes for AFRT that should end pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the candidates for the Presidency Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should in the future end disputes about the settlement for the elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the success of today's football representation should calm this war before the vote.
Pelta, before the September election that did not take place, promised to devote itself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if he is elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly and this two-month delay could well enable him to defend his vision of football leadership and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president to come on Thursday.”
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, has worked for a large number of years at Sparta and the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies an euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone realized."
"If there weren't all these various interpretations, we would have had a President since September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the civic association's most important document that caught the full attention of the delegates.
“If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all responsibility for it in case it doesn’t work.”
“This is a principle without which we cannot exist,” Pelta added.
Then he strives, they say, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he acknowledges in terms of his legal training and that he is well aware that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time, who, on the contrary, continues to criticize Pelta.
"He's been playing football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent but remains, he said, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
His strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from competitions from the lowest level to national representation.
It should be a soccer showcase.
And I would also endeavour to finish all the affairs that begin with that of the Bohemians or the follow-up to the corruption scandal.
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for the whole football," the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to the head of football would not bring any change of people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov where there is a comprehensible nervousness since there is no leadership.
Although there are catastrophic scenario planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there is only one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round, we will be able to overcome it.”
“Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head,” Pelta optimistically declares two days before the day likely to be decisive for his career as an official.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would begin to work hard
"If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Football Association to the General Assembly on Thursday, it would not please many people," he said.
Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected we will begin to work hard.
He wants systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to deal with football as a whole.”
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a high-performance youth football."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the competences within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific field."
“And I will distribute difficult missions so that football is facing a big step forward.”
“A lot of people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others,” he added.
He said, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
“About me, we know that I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know if it’s worth it and if I’ll have people behind me who will constantly put me in the wheels and raise doubts about every one of my actions,” he said.
“Many people have told me I shouldn’t give up because they would give up too.”
“It’s a trust I can’t betray,” he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
“Since the last two years there has been a great deal of work and I don’t want to let it down.”
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I wouldn't like anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will come back as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta can’t do.”
“Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen.”
“I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not to bear any of them.”
“I strive to be objective.”
“I want to play football for everyone because everyone will be happy not only with those who have been chosen.
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for Czechia.
"And if some say the opposite, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia."
For example, it is time to consider the second division to be divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would be in the first division.
"There would be no situation like with only three Moravian teams in the division now because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of president, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
“I always feel the support of the Czech House that has elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes,” said Rajchl, who is considering among his future successes saving tens of millions of crowns on disadvantaged contracts, negotiations of contracts with TVs and the gambling law.
On the contrary, the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault for all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose his credibility," he thinks the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he were elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make a noticeable change among people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to spoil his successes," said Rajchl who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue

UFO optics canopies, magnificent swimming pools in Budapest: Who travels across Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in soaking baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool one can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is one item that should not be missed in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Stretched on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged docks, and swimed against the Putten marbles that waited for her on the other side of the pool and did not miss admiring the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her notebook all interesting details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her previously published book: "Badefreuden (Joies of the Bath). The municipal indoor swimming pools of Münch, the historic bath palaces in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervent of the bath culture.
Meder explains that she doesn’t have much interest in sport but she feels attracted to water in a completely different way.
It is annoying that swimming fans must just look at blue tiles and accommodate the smell of bleach while joggers breathe perfume enchanting spice forests or can listen to the cheerful birds of the park.
“One day I wondered why the swimming pools should always be so ugly,” she said.
"So I was starting a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils - a wellness factor in the swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders had given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is transparent on one side, but on the other, however, reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces appear optically in a double manner: high arches, multicoloured tiles, trampolines.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a 190-page interesting report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes a desire to make a leap into the blue.
Collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Besides the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca form) as well as a bath of thermal baths whose pools are filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Terénym)
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zurich bath you can see the whole city in his eyes, you can admire the snowy Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the Ötztal mountains rise towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of bleach does not emanate from all the swimming pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulfur, Arpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong oil smell, which is hard to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its lemon sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she stood in front of a barricaded ground.
The bath designed by architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Taking a look through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the blossoming of weeds between the tiles.
She observed a contrary effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; you can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its conception in 1844 but also a Maurish room in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of the swimming pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is native to Schwarzwald.
"It's already a nice performance to melt such different construction styles into such a great unit," said Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the spa pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
German bank examines raw material speculation in detail
by Christian Teevs
Does the German bank give up its raw material speculation?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences from it.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of those surveyed even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this business avenue because it increases the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann emphasizes in this article that global commodity stock market speculation pushes prices upwards and that banks share a complicity with global famine.
The consumer protection campaign concretely aligns against Deutsche-Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act the same way.
Raw material speculation was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that bettors have disconnected from bids and demands - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from U.S. competitors: he promised to investigate the accusations and said, "No case is worth putting at stake the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the charges of Foodwatch-Report.
The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank board of directors should be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the raw materials market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Speculation about rising food prices shows in a particularly drastic way how badly today’s banks are harming the general interest.”
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly under obligation today.
“The Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it’s about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank’s reputation is at stake.”
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the Group CEO wants to present a perfect image a few months before leaving his duties.
Deutsche Bank announced Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change what is planned to be in the Board of Directors.
It could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will worry about it.
One in two would terminate investments in commodities.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute completed questionnaires of 1001 people.
Only 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculations.
43% would discourage such a bank from their surroundings, 49% responded that they would think about termination of their account to change banking institutions.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and fell into ruin.
Now it is open again and is the place of an exhibition house.
If one is enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, glass hangars, vivid and bold appearances and new building materials that are typical of belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is a well-known example.
The Pavilion of Schwanzer once received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its construction in steel and glass, lightweight and suspended.
Construction is regarded to this day as an important milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has decayed more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "House of the 21st Century" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the Belvédère museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a shot of luck from any point of view.
The new start was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvédère in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic skater, subsequently at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she led particularly well the works of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, and she obtained funds in public.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a cafe and a bookstore are located there, and an office must be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensitively transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his travel to Vienna and its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "an energy gap," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, the insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was placed and the roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings were rehabilitated.
Two basements made room for the new operation, a screened light panel between the house and the road ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in a tint of red-brown rust protection.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it was once.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also please the Office of Monuments Protection," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, “which came from Brussels,” Krischanitz recently said, a typical story of “Drop-in-the-City.”
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden is just the newly planned "quarter of the central station", with offices and apartments.
And perhaps another luck will happen: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, as collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, it already negotiates with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The newspaper Bild-Zeitung previously reported, invoking an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments of a total of around 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should enable a better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in case of extreme weather conditions.
The number of internal and external employees for snow removal of railway facilities and docks is expected to double to 16,000.
The goal is to get rid of snow and ice on the docks until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment needed for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Railway Station Chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks, among other things, reserves in the event of harsh weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had a lot of work to do for years, since it must have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more often at the workshop, after a rupture of axles occurred on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this sector giant catches up further in the US: the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million in comparison to resolve a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The financial market regulator NCUA is bringing a whole series of charges to major banks, inducing cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and led banks down.
"We are pleased that we have been able to find a solution to this without the parties initiating proceedings in court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York said.
The Bank did not acknowledge any faults in comparison.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. cooperative banks and acts in case of bankruptcy to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage incurred.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other major banks aside and in summer he assigned to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As far as mortgage documents are concerned, this is Mortgage-backed Securities.
Credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the summit of the financial crisis, U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years ago, at present there is a storm wind blowing on American banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous remedies to seek reparation or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of complaints.
She accuses 18 major international banks, both US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having benefited in kind in mortgage deals of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, which involves a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities request that Frankfurter respond to "substantial losses" but nevertheless without citing a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett Increases by 10 Billion at IBM
Buffett, the financial guru, invests huge sums in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, major U.S. investor Warren Buffett continues to explain not to invest in IT companies, given that the long-term evolution of companies only shows bad forecasts.
However, it read IBM's reports and changed its views on investments in this sector.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and IT systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment is considered a knight’s attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT business now grants itself the right to be called "Mr. IBM".
Buffett revealed today to the CNBC economic issue, which he has purchased since March of IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM has never known anything about this commitment so far.
He commended the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had secured reasonable profits.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been relying for some time on profitable IT services as an operation of accounting centres.
The pioneer in computing, over 100 years old, offers both software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had rather avoided technology companies so far.
He says he invests only in the companies he understands the business of.
But on the contrary, Buffett rather attacks rail charters, lubricants and machine manufacturers.
Sa Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries and shares in a range of major groups such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Rück Munich.
The 81-year-old took over Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the world’s most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why it is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible meaning of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
Following the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock market.
“Big Blue,” as IBM also refers to, has a total market value of over $220 billion and accounts with Apple and Microsoft among the world’s most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media doubt the rule of law in Germany.
A newspaper even talks about a "bloody ideology" that would be reborn now.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and anxiety.
For many German-Turks the spectrum that was long believed to be dead has reappeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
In Germany there is xenophobia, but it has never been discussed.
However, the detected right-wing extremist network reveals proportions that are far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology," "That was the title of the online release of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, however, that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right mud.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted reasonably: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community of Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a fiftieth anniversary ceremony of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media have the effect of a blow: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article on the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also, the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not deprive itself of unambiguous conditions.
"it begins to smell," is the title of Ahmet Kulahci's chronicle.
He stressed that people were murdered, paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
Police action was perceived very critically in the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why didn’t the German authorities come to the mind much earlier to do research in some suspected right-wing environments, the perpetrators are surprised.
More than one is prepared for at least rhetoric and drastic means: “If the case continues to be faulty, there will be nothing left for migrants but self-defense and arms.”
“It will be the best self-defense.”
"Inland peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the Mölln and Solingen attacks in the 1990s explained well.
The picture of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, to what distrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was especially the failure of German politics after the attacks the Turkish press complained of: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was counting at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report once again shows how deep the distrust of many Germano-Turks has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to the efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate extreme-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and in the meantime patinate from one crisis to another.
He's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
Following his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank; we learned in July, that he would occupy an almost as spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained strength and made kind comments on future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
As of September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had diverted all of the Bank's security systems and had erupted around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS board chief Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The UBS board chairman has since been considered to be suffering - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised by the bank from February 2012.
And he will resume the chairmanship of administration already in May – not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is becoming difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At one point he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is on one huge side - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been patinating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing seems to spare the so proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from easy customers than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's biggest banks.
It made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later professor of banking for many years in Zurich says, "I have always taken UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
"In the current optics, one wonders, how could I have simply been so mistaken?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007 it turned out that for the first time something was not going around at UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli retreated in a surprising way, who was previously regarded as a high intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we saw why he was gone.
The division of the bank had erupted with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and crossed it.
For this she actually found investors, but who, shortly before, would have scratched the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state background from Singapore and an Arab state background, which was ignored, to the point that it was never even known its name.
But that was only the first shot.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank was once again to announce billions of losses, and Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still Switzerland’s second highest-paid board in 2006, withdrew.
In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: the UBS, due to its investment errors, was in the financial crisis before bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank has bought tens of billions of problematic securities from the UBS, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country, to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster, it followed the second.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had surrendered due to a tax dispute with America and has declared ready to publish the data of the wealthy customers, who had perhaps fraudulently tricked the tax officer with the Bank's help.
In addition, she accepted a payment of $780 million - in reimbursement of unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus, the UBS more or less published that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time, she has lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of clients' money.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility in a few months in the two main business sectors: bank investment due to poor speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was somewhat a calm return, and as it was thought, that the UBS would get away, it followed from this unfortunate story of title merchants: a single title merchant bursts 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was not going around.
And we’re publishing: with risk management in investment banking it still doesn’t seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, we have found that the control of risks has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is sure: "The problem with the UBS is that it does not have control of risks in hand."
However, it was exactly the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken their role, that of becoming guardians of the world's great fortune: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from Zurich Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany’s can be found here among Swiss tradition stores as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the Crédit Suisse palace to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
We get into the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are coated with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day taken away from the market – or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, the UBS and the Crédit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, eventually like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would have further spread.
The Swiss would no longer have anything to say.
"And yet, they have long adapted to the Anglo-Saxon customs."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the large Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday, the small country's government coalition with seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in their nation's history," writer Lukas Heiß wrote in his book "The UBS Crash."
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
When talking to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks jointly concluded a huge group.
A bank was established, which was already too large for the small Switzerland - and has recorded an ever-increasing growth.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS completed: a rich, but lethargic bank with as a strength asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already strongly internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorable access to a lot of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly chairman of the board of directors.
“I’ve always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great, modest intellectual, who understands it very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who paved his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have relied until the end on Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic fall."
Perhaps tragic.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders at which the leader of the Wuffli Group always pronounced the same motto: to dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of currency and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
However, the business advisors, who were responsible for this, pointed out a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
UBS would have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To bridge this gap, the UBS started on an adventure that almost cost him his life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages - but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have long sought to go down.
"Even in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought it," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be harder than one thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and are so far banking.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the investment bank, focus on property management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn’t want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as it is clear so far.
Next Thursday, Chief Bank Officer Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Switzerland was only supposed to be transitional when the bank with surprise separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has imposed itself: it must lead the affairs of the UBS sustainably, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
He cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who's she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He said publicly so far only that he was going to find an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the U.S. stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe at the weekend has discouraged U.S. investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
Industrial production on the continent has stifled the hopes of a stabilization of the debt crisis in its germ.
General relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro has fallen from the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only half-filled last week, not half-empty - but now the problems are rushing again to the foreground, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The default values of the Dow-Jones-Index noted a loss of approximately 0.6% at 12,078 points at the closing of the markets.

U.S. investors have expressed themselves in a skeptical way: “We are not an island, on the other hand, dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness from banks.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, from his point of view, it was too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decade-old principle into the wind and entered the US technology industry.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of this traditional group, and allowed it to score almost over 1%, against the trend of business management.
The paper ended almost unchanged at $187.35.

Smart horns spread in cities
In many places, freaks are regarded as "bird problem°" but experts say these very intelligent animals have long been unable to be hunted out of cities.
Some love them, some others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The horns have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of residents are multiplying because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote against the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first Ostfriesisch symposium on horns, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt the freaks of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on the possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Nature protectors also based the problems of the cities on the exodus of particularly protected woods: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional vital areas.
The hunting, design and cutting of typical rowing trees made life difficult for birds.
The horns are protected by nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 rowing pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative advertisements because of the horn massacre in the region.
Critics found the catch of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal turkeys.
“Normal expulsion, eviction, is useless,” said Werner Klöver, the planner of the city and landscape of Leer.
Destroying nests with water under pressure or cutting down trees often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals move away, the large colonies divide and they scatter elsewhere.”
Evincing is only imaginable in exceptional cases such as hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them.”
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of evicting animals with averse packaging and captivating offers, in order to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens prospected "info signs instead of sawmills" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can ultimately better endure a button on the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-routement-educational baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the lives of these very intelligent freaks.
In the meantime, this project has been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "There's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say."
The intelligence and ability of animals are legendary: the freaks not only use working instruments to get to a delight, but they themselves make their tools as working instruments.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge recently tested four freaks, how much bird intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to crack a scaffold with stones to reach a larva.
Without much training, they determinedly acknowledged that a stone had to be certain size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, clever horns were then to solve a more trapped problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their spoils with their beech.
However, the researchers had put pieces of iron wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo draws Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a coup by the Bosnians and the Turks remained unsuccessful.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the 2012 European Championship playoffs in Poland and eliminated Ukraine.
Driven by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made its fifth European championship participation perfect after the match's 0:0.
The Czechs reached the eliminatory return match by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was more hot in the 0:0 draw match between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) release against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored the other tires for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic with a hand-played 11-meter penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made a shortcut for Bosnia twice.
Sena Lulic was confronted with a yellow-red card (54e).
Bosnia had already failed in the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured departure.
Ronaldo sent a free kick 30 meters ahead in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed her shooting qualities at a distance and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did nothing in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
Former Wolfsburger, the leader of the Manchester City English championship, initiated a headball headed downwards the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech
Finally, Ergolding’s referee Wolfgang Stark is at the center of all attention.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark awarded a controversial 11-meter hand-played penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic surely diverged.
But, after the break, the 2004 European Vice-Champion succeeded in four strokes and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for the fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with legionaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech with a reflex prevented a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored at the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the world class guard of the Czechs already shot down, once again, the FC Seoul attacker had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey was missing the Zagreb football miracle during that time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the bench of the 2002 third EM, the Croats were able to rejoice in their fourth round in the final of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim was not even able to bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62th Minute, the Bundesliga legionaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already taken the first step with a success of 4:0 for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57e) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed to a higher speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Los Angeles Galaxy's Robbie Keane received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment was Estonia's defense able to prevent a possible goal of the -first goalkeeper.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and tightened the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Until 2015, approximately two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” CEO Bill McDermott announced to his customers on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the world leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this rapidly expanding country.
Growth plans in China are also an important part of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase revenue by 2015 to €20 billion.
Last year, the Walldorfer recorded revenues of nearly €12.5 billion.
Currently, the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked so well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund’s new book offers depth and generosity, entitled “The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War”, it begins with a long list of characters that tightens your heart.
A tip to get started: carefully rip this page and make it your bookmark.
In this romantic narrative by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mist of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book, which he accurately describes as "a book of anti-history."
It has a few known names, important treaties or famous battles; almost no ambassadors or discussions about strategies and materials are found.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like," it's the "feelings, impressions, experiences, and moods."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, to doctors, ambulances and sellers.
Some of them will become heroes.
Others are prisoners of war, some will lose members, go mad, or lose their lives.
Their lives waver here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguishing, new ones are re-fired.
Peter Englund's book deviates from traditional history books.
He denied the idea that World War I could only be summed up by the terrible trench war on the western front.
"Beauty and grief" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; one Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an untreatable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe, like a hurricane Katrina that smells cordite.
When gun shots sound in the distance, and you are a mother of the household, do you stay or flee?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been enhanced by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"Beauty and grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most are dealing with deprivation and the ability to get out of it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, überall Ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a fake wooden bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; soles of wooden shoes."
He states that "837 substitute meats are registered in the sausage production. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories address honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own impulse towards savagery and states about war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant to do, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that it has no bars.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to it.
“When one is resigned to sacrifice oneself, one hopes to have an audience,” he wrote.
This is unfortunately rather comparable to “a convicted man strangled in secret.”
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is increasingly becoming a history of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviours as there is heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who at all costs tried to catch a veneral illness among prostitutes in order to avoid front service.
"The most grotesque expression is found in the trade in pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread onto the genitals in the hope of finishing in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into lifelong blindness."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way that war has “triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best books dealing with World War I are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West nothing new", rather than complete.
Peter Englund's book is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming one I have ever read in a non-fictional work.
I'm not going to reveal it.
But it's as if he'd come out of his book, grabbed with your hands this page where the list of people appears and burned with a lighter.
After a first wrong step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be the emptiest.
The operation remained secret to all, except for a few senior officers and others informed from the beginning that they would proceed to an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, with his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, which went against the settlement of the department and generated a storm of public solidarity for the protesters.
The operation to clean the Zuccotti Park of its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by watching the occupations take place in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers are being better trained against riots – anti-terrorism measures that involve rapidly moving a large number of police officers – to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place Monday evening, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move through the park arrived "at the last minute," said one regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
“The few police officers I know and who have been called did not know that they would go to Zuccotti Park,” the person said in an anonymity.
"The only ones who know they would go there are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department."
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were coming and going to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency services vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages from speakers seemed to intimidate protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windproof, many protesters simply gathered their affairs and left.
No tents were hit until 1:45 a.m., police said, leaving occupants time to collect their items.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the Chief of Police Department, said this was taken solely for security purposes.
But according to many journalists, the Police would have prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly held by the officers.
Mr. Browne said the television camera trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the protesters’ busy business wreckage, including luggage, plastic grass, and clothing-filled leaf bags, sanitation teams were following, cleaning up everything the occupants were leaving behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away and the images were broadcast on the Internet shortly thereafter.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the Police has moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicentre of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people have been chained to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park before 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to the police, the cleaning operation was completed about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most for "disruption in public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the highest grade officer to have been found on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Detectives Department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "was not heading the operations," Browne said.
A second group of policemen were waiting along the eastern side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case of an intervention needed.
Barricades have been laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, to the south.
Police have been expanding the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, were reportedly even seen pushing people to move them away.
Nearly 28 people were on the northern side.
One of the most lively actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, while others were spotted dying the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood emerged flying from the crowd.
Finally, a police officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The school aid union prosecutes the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school aids who lost their jobs last month, plans to trial the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecutions are probably the union's ultimate weapon, the 37th District Council, in an attempt to cancel the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees, among the city's lowest-paid, lost their jobs on October 7, and the trade union leaders compared these dismissals to a political revenge for not letting the city access to a health care fund led by groups of workers, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, mentioning that dismissals of school aid were not specified in the budget.
37th District Council officers said they would fill out a complaint notice, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution to the Manhattan Supreme State Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City Education Department will constitute the defendant, and the complainants will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of which are black or of Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of dismissals in schools in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods of the city to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no dismissals on Staten Island, and just a few at Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aid workers lost their jobs in the 23rd Brownsville District, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts in the Southern Bronx Districts.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school aid workers at Harlem Public School 36, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecutors say that "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring funds to fill budget shortages."
The public school budget 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each disadvantaged student enrolment.
The union also claims that high school directors may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "exceeding" to describe the action, although "exceeding" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parents' coordinators have been dismissed", and "not only because of exceeding."
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya issue
It seems ultimately that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement in the Capitol on the question of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as the American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and US troops for their "encouragement".
“This resolution is to honor the courage of the Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
"It is a bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the House also rejected a measure aimed at reducing the financing of U.S. operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission has therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress is upset enough to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his foot.
The indecision of Congress has been overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee’s resolution “congratulates the Libyan people on their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also states “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission or will it divide the legislators as in June?
Senator and Chairman of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not read the latest version of the new project yet.
Within the Capitol, the House must vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to achieve a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to have their amendments approved, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to be submitted to Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of the amendment only for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters—especially new Republicans who want to golden their CVs—the chance to boast of being the “author” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for the House and Senate to vote on a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments ensuring the right to quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting profanation of the flag.
Some lawmakers also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As eager as the members have been to propose amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111st Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th Congress.
The rate slows compared to the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten," Gabrielle Giffords said in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after an armed man shot him in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on a television show Monday night, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to primarily recover rather than return to Congress.
When she appeared on ABC's "20/20" newspaper, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show addressed its difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first televised interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and wounded thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords replied "rather good."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during an hour-long special edition of "20/20", broadcast the day before the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special show traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he was seen on his hospital bed, with his head shaved and a wide scar on his forehead.
She can only use one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair as doctors teach her how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word: "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change her breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?.
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours each day with the doctors, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped her and asked for information for the first time about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated awaiting the trial.
“There have been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Tough, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
“So I would say, ‘Gabby, you weren’t beaten,’” Mark Kelly said.
You've just been slaughtered.
And you'll get away, recover and come back even stronger than ever.
More mercy than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless New York City veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in suit-ticket stood at his feet to praise him.
“The military, both men and women, are considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A military senior present at the gala, in which also participated Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armies, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as some kind of orphan," the military senior wrote in an email.
I’m sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, it was mercy.
Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have set up between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praises are given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, some military declare.
The public is increasingly acting as if they were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan, said.
“But it seems that the only way to support ourselves is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits.”
This is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about mercy take place confidentially among veterans.
After his two sons returned from the fight with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they faced insurgents and travelled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," Cancian said, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some people who were passing the interviews to him subtly asked if he would be able to handle the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after he returned from the fight.
“When you’re talking about the service, you’re facing negative impressions,” Colonel Cancian recalled when talking to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely commended by a country so unfamiliar with the army and seeing little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
The troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
Army faces increasing pressure to deal with rapists
This week, a capital hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction over rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could come to her in his room for a drink.
“It was an alarm signal,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane put aside her worry.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man caught her from behind, thrown to the ground and raped, she claims.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will await with anxiety the court ruling during a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the generalization of rapes within the army, thus infringing the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Ranked in February by Susan Burke, a Washington lawyer, the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number amounted to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by colleagues soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide appropriate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke declares to attack the winning military, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."
The lawyer also states that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future legal proceedings.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the complainants in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will bring several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, referred to as the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not liable for injuries suffered by active personnel.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants," the documents state.
The Department of Defense refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to battle, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, including in contacting local women.
Result: in these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives - two-thirds in battle.
It is time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogyne atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Vietnam Veterans of America non-profit foundation is preparing a trial against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" attributed to victims of rape in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a group for the rights of men.
His group filed a trial with the Veterans Administration in December, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported by the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, because according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also studies the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases recorded in the military were tried - half of the percentage of the civilian judicial system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case describe their aggression as the first in a series of trauma.
In Lyman's case, she informed the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell 11 times in detail about her rape to different police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her aggressor - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting in front of a judge, in a trial in which she is questioned about her sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who eventually was acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was rendered,” said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions, I started shouting after court."
“I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember telling my commander, ‘This was not his trial, but mine.’”
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honourable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Will the Lyman case and other complainants move forward or not, it’s a long history, says John Turley, a professor of law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction lies between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents posed by liability.
“The odds are heavily against them... but it’s important that they try,” he adds.
These things only change when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the complainants’ lawyer, will gather hundreds of other complainants for further trials.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until there is no reform," she said.
Where until we died, either of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged he was caught from a deadly madness in Norway in July, leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with a few of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easily... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized that it wasn’t so difficult to find them,” said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, Jamie Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they are looking for with scientific accuracy – the way merchants have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. They targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes toward violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: the online supporters of the right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new tool in the hands of scientists.
Thinking groups, medicine researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, thanks to "Like", wall-based publications and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three contents per day, the “data supernova” generates a search explosion, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title by nearly 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook lies in the fact that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You were supposed to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," Bartlett said.
"Facebook avoids all of this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their intoxicated exploits were much more likely to be alcoholic than discrete students about it.
Megan Moreno suggested that colleagues from the students, such as counselors, could monitor the site and eventually intervene to help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute, the Washington Post said.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics regarding the valentine's day and love situation, the participation rate in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is quite another thing online.
"I don't think a large number of users have ever thought that a researcher could study their profile," said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study will be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you’re saying on Facebook and what you’re doing in reality are two completely different things,” Selwyn said.
That’s why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he said.
“Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect – and the social aspect is not in front of a computer.”
"Cold and Inhuman": first appearance by Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a “resistance fighter” at his first appearance in the Oslo trial.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Templars,” he said in front of a courtroom filled with 500 people.
"Regarding the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting a hatred ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
“I acknowledge the facts, but I do not plead guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "doesn't want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought a speech on paper with him, speak to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in custody for twelve more weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondences for eight weeks.
Around 30 parents of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All attended the hearing with the aim of seeing the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally moved a bit forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the courtroom.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not mad and also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks therefore appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some of them.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred that he looked like a monster, but that's not the case," a relative of a victim said.
"It would have been much easier."
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview in Cinema This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical engineer and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will be aired this week in the first part of a film on major markets, is how much this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organizational chart enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a genius exception.
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sat down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple and was already working hard on his new NeXT IT company, aimed at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transportation.
It is only after Steve Jobs’ death that a full video is found in the director’s garage.
This slightly uphill video is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be aired in theaters on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly excited to expose technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide an accurate answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, when he seems eager to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbow kicks to speed him up and move on to issues or topics of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strange aspect of Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and expresses his own vision of the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then implements them.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
“For all these years, I’ve always been asking, ‘Why are you doing things?’ and the answers are constantly the same, ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs continues giving details on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed about how costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" rated at the nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour at the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack phone networks and phone for free on long distances.
The device has been the subject of many writings beforehand, but Steve Jobs's euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you screamed in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door," Jobs said laughing.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn't know much about both of us, but we were able to invent a little thing capable of controlling great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful round that he and Wozniak developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two complicites laugh crazy just before the Pope himself is awakened.
About his love of technology (and Bill Hewlett’s departure):
At the age of 12, on the hunt for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and calls him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs gets a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company’s research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first desktop computer ever designed.”
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was returned to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On improvisation of innovation:
At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head-to-head.
At the beginning of his career, as he sets up to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 credit days, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big quarrels... I was screamed at me pretending it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I got enough, I got out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that proved incredibly reliable.
On the large companies that are breathing out:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would be mistaken and lose control of their market share.
"Let's admit that you worked at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copy or printer, and then?"
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not have more success.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [those are these types of people] that end up leading businesses and product-specialized staff are put away from decision-making.
The product engineering that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product in comparison to a bad product - the manual work required.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire IT industry.
It could have made ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the defeat from the victory.
Innovation as an artistic form:
“A huge portion of manual work separates a great idea from an outstanding product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to do... Some things you can’t do, electrons can do, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (those concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It's about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you're creating.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists fly.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
This is partly what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with health law adversaries as court meets
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the issue of political disagreement, namely whether the opposition to President Obama’s health law will be heard, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the High Court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved a trial filed by 26 states contesting the ambitious health care reform voted by Congress last year, a law that has been a gathering point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, indeed, a monumental 5:30 a.m. argument is expected next March, and the result will likely be of a nature to favor the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming at the time the court’s decision will be rendered.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue about the rejection of the law will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. solicitor general during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial issue in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican of the Senate and declared adversary of the health law.
The guests at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would doubtfully argue by the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising from law-related organizations and others although the judge may not be an intervener, an honor guest, or appearing on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dismantles any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little respect for critics claiming that they were too easily mixing court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a solicitor general for Obama's administration when the first oppositions to the law were brought at the trial level.
Her critics pushed for Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records $18 billion order for aircraft
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-courier aircraft, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order that includes 50 of its products.
This is a case when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches a record $18 billion.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridors.
It is Emirates airline based in Dubai who placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the Dubai Aviation Show in 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, raising the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that flatters significant fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The amount of these six aircraft amounts to more than $1 billion.
“It’s clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
“These customers in particular have immense value.”
In the Middle East, oil producing countries own many of their airlines.
They therefore not only have the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually harmful to airlines as it represents their largest expenses - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in oil prices.
This is an important point because these airlines will be less likely than others to cancel or delay their aircraft orders as oil prices rise, Dihora reported.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
The Emirates order reinforces Boeing’s predominance in the large-scale aircraft market and helps curb the attempted intrusion of the competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the aeronautical show comes four months after Airbus announced to postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which directly competes with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing its debut to increase its push following the demand of its customers to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing’s shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's sister clearly beaten in Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says the drug traffickers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race as governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her attempt to access the posts of governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said Monday that drug traffickers have favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the forefront of the race as the governor of this state of the west.
“The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country,” Luisa Maria Calderon told the radio in an interview Monday following the elections.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral officers... They seized the polls, set up road blocks... and forced people to vote” for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until losing the presidency in 2000.
But he is organizing his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have spotted only a few of Calderon, who was at the forefront of the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential election for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, has denied any links with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose the Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Nevertheless, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections, a mayor of the PAN was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates resigned locally to the campaign out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man waiting to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging in view of next year."
BASD strongly urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Manila-based BASD chief executive, said the two fastest-growing economic powers in the world must "do everything in their power" to speed up the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all together in this crisis.”
“So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not safe."
“So if China and India can help, nothing will stop them.”
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has risen dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fear that the world economy will go into recession, and has sparked the call of major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that the IMF would deliver any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral aid - such as buying the bonds of the U.S. financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Asian partners in Europe.
Indian Trade and Industry Minister Anand Sharma said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying inflow of foreign capital.
“No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and unrestled,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the wealthy Europeans while facing their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get aid to Europe to the 1.2 billion Indians, of whom at least 800,000 live with $2 a day or less.
“One day, they will find out that the Greeks retire at age 50 and go on vacation in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it,” he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis risked causing "significant repercussions" across Asia.
BASD's forecast of a 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 is now facing "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets need to develop "rescue plans" to protect themselves from economic shifts and significant capital leaks.
Severe Pentagon warnings about potential defense reductions
Defence Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that imminent automatic budget compressions would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields, through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more compression will be imminent if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
“The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting from what is called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
"A reduction of such a size, applied thus undistingly, would make most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we almost certainly should send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal."
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation.”
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
"Although wartime financing of the accounts of contingency operations abroad is not directly affected by the sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
“Contracting staff would be reduced, leading to delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war.”
“Wage-managing staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic compression on the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequence of a sequestration on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as an undisputed world leader of military power.”
"We are strongly opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon during the publication of Panetta's letter.
“It is not a consequence that we can live with, and it is certainly not the one that we should impose on ourselves.”
“Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.”
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators are increasing pressure for a budget compromise or an appeal to exempt the Pentagon from reductions remains to be seen.
Panetta has become more and more virulent about possible compressions, even though he himself reached the highest position of the Pentagon accumulating years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what could happen - a military with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless brigade."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
“It’s a depressed force, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential opponents.”
"In fact, she invites to aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: delay in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits to our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the largest defense projects could move to the cutter, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the next generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the army and navy.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Identify a Lie
A look at the recent headlines indicates how omnipresent deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy sharing allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were accused of false sworn in allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone stating to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lie has destroyed quarries and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, made himself an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations of funding campaigns related to the coverage of an extramarital liaison.
And then, none of those who lived history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The narratives of cheating at the school and university tests are a legion.
There have been cases where teachers gave test responses to students in order to show themselves well on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that strangers lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to shout: "I've had you," the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data gathered over the past six decades from prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, including in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lies have been demystified.
Liars are looking in your eyes.
They don’t tick, red, or stir up always.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to uncover.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the statement structure, facial micro-expression, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific findings in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include including hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
Good liars are skilled in reading others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extraverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is what is called "establishing the benchmark data".
This helps provide a benchmark for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, laughter, vocal quality.
You need to know if someone normally stirs his feet constantly so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him stir his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and non-verbal misleading behaviour.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the upper body when trying to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, significantly change posture, or present a "post-interview" relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson scraped off using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use distant language: "I didn't have sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or fully repeat a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to be true... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the response perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Oil Pipeline Plan Will Be Distorted After U.S. Threat of Late Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - sparking anger from trade unions while calming environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to put it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain the approval of a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal license for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska dunes and Ogallala watershed, large groundwater sources.
“It’s a real path forward,” Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The re-environmental review commissioned by the Department of State would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed its support.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta Province to Texas Refineries.
In order to do so, it would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the 20,000 estimated jobs related to the pipeline.
But the Nebraska lawmakers opposed to this plan put pressure on a law to force the removal of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's ongoing Environmental Impact Study found that the project would only have limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice by its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit from fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, launched in a row of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, frightened their little girl to the point where she vomited in fear.
Singer "Lady Marmalade" has frightened the 18-month-old little Geneviève Monk to the point that she has suffered "personal changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said during the trial in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was November 10 of last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his childcare teacher wife Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing for a family trip.
As Kevin Monk was going to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down into the hallway of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and laid her daughter for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and I went for her," she said.
LaBelle angryly warned the pregnant woman.
“She told me in an aggressive tone: ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter near the door,’” said Roseanna Monk.
“I replied, ‘Whatever you say or think I’m not interested.’
She became angry and started to use swears -- the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me water from the bottle.
She said that at this point Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'' said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw herself on the mom - who was still holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her surroundings who pulled her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loudly that she started vomiting, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
The lawyer and LaBelle representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a child cancer charity.
“The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a nursery teacher carrying an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has hampered the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez’s management, unemployment and informality in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment decreased and the economy contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, that generated great expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the main indicators are not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of development
Low temperatures in February, apart from causing trillion losses for the agriculture sector, limited the state's economy's opportunities for growth, caused a shrinking of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the frost report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages of 582 million 835 hectares grown, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops suffered and were vegetables.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate of the state is 9 percent for the first three quarters of the year, 69 percent for the first quarter of the year has been observed an accelerated rise, as from January to March 55 thousand 053 people were unemploy, with a rate of 4.53 percent in the
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactory, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly based on the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who make dollars in an illicit way it is not easy that they work to earn them, that they invest them and use them in something."
Migration detainees
López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
“The number of people leaving the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because by entering they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for work sources, which causes unemployment to rise,” he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labour market in the Sinaloa exacerbates considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker in any social insurance institution.
Aside from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the lag for the state is the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Prevision.
The average monthly income of the Signal workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, which is 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Aside from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 there was the strongest decrease in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economic Affairs, the State FDI reached $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74 percent from the previous 5 million 143,000 in the same period of $312.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State accounted for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, registered mainly by the companies of the tertiary sector.
The Debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State sought in July at the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State Congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November the sector was not endeavored.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employer sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés' government demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
“The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we had to align the effort of all and above all the already synchronized good running of this new government team, hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events such as early-year frosts trapped the state’s economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, among which frost, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not run fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows for an acceptable level of flow in trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefine the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Mexican Patronal Confederation of the Republic of Sinaloa, said that the state is to be channeled towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we think it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we detonate the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
Much to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a forward-looking vision that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He reported that the current administration has shown progress in managing public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still much to be done," he said.
Convicted of 8 kilos of marijuana
A person residing in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the small convicted trafficker is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army officers on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was driving in a white pick-up truck, in which he carried a black bag in the luggage carrier of the vehicle and in the co-pilot square a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items were made available to the District Second Judge and the convicted person is still in the Legal Consequences of Crimes Execution Centre.
Debts to contributions to books
The social works contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrants risk not being finished where there are serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although construction programmes have progressed so far, they are at risk because the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to provide contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He noted that in total, the investment in these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is a possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end they haven't given us anything, even if since July they had to give us a portion of it," he said, "and we, to not record delays, started the works and we made a lot of progress, but we need the money."
He noted that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, and therefore, at the beginning of the administration, the Municipality had to seek a loan to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided at that time.
“We had already suffered this in the previous sexennial period because the state had not the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to function and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid,” he said.
Despite a commitment by the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had requested Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate management to ensure that the corresponding percentages arrived as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is soon to end, they haven’t given us anything.”
The Court validates "analog cut-off" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) disputed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the House of Deputies formulated against the presidential decree advancing the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes needed to invalidate it were not gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to realise the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not having reached a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because radio and television regulations are a statutory assignment reserved to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of ministers also resolved to dismiss the complaint made by the House of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister-President said he disagreed with the arguments of the draft, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards measures for the public administration to prepare for them.
"I don't think that if it were done it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has the constitutional mandate of the leadership of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this results in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalization that involves a decision of public interest that has not only a technical dimension, “because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These questions, he stressed, "requires the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State."
He recalled that many countries around the world have already completed the digital transition and have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded in some way the sphere of competence of Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative, he assured.
The possibility of a "vote-by-vote" count is being analyzed in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second places of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6,000 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second places of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán did not approve neither his Political Constitution nor his State Electoral Code nor his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the Congress of the State had approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process to come into force, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the time prescribed by the Offician.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and called “invalid and unlawful” the vote of the state’s representative for constitutional reforms, because he has no right to “sanction or challenge them.”
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that through the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no voting record and counting in the file of the urn is not found in the president of the urn; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of votes received in all election polls may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the supposed winner of the respective election and the one who won the second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point presented; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the representative of the second party or the party.
The total counting of the vote may also be carried out if at the end of the joint counting, the difference between the supposed winner and that of the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party from which the candidate came second, in which case the electoral packages that were the subject of the counting are excluded.
It should be noted that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday at night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem.
According to his family, the Lieutenant Colonel's last desire was that his ashes should be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving tributes from other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on the edge of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the Lieutenant Colonel’s ashes arrived at the vigil chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes at the Instituto Technológico de Saltillo organized by his former technological colleagues and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for the bachelor's degree.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes spread in the Zapalinamé mountains, he always said that to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the Lieutenant Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, a loving brother and cared for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it, because they said he even had a truck pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a driver.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, so he knows that his uncle dies doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honours, we said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, a tribute to whom the Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, studied through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, and the Salt's.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed alongside the Government Secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all officials of that service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinered) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his master family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother and other brothers.
Three abandoned bodies, located in Cadereyta NL property
A few hours before they were found, the military authority presented the media to eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of the body and with the shot of grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has the color beige and coffee the portal was widely open.
Looking inside, approximately three meters away, they located the corpses of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
A meter away was the body of another individual wearing a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on the stomach.
According to data obtained in situ, the three people had been murdered in another location because no sleeves were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by a crime group organized to the other, apart from a few bullet orifices in the property and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated primarily in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to sequestrations, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to the information published, in a first case on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and managed to save one who had been deprived of liberty.
They were confiscated three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas."
In another event that took place on November 12 at 6:00 p.m., military personnel made a surveillance course in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on November 13 at 2 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested at La Frauda, when he tried to escape seeing the military.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government facing a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form the government.
It is expected that he presents a cabinet composed in his majority of technocrats, even though it is unclear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner for Journalists said.
Monti did not explicitly state that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well traced,” he added.
Monti has completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels that cannot be sustained.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a harsh austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the affected trust in Italy.
Emphasizing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success have been greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic-majority government that Monti formed.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a Monti bankruptcy would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday consultations with political parties, trade unions and employer groups and youth and women’s organizations.
He will finish his meeting tour Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should persist until the future elections scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before the elections advances.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but major parties insist that it should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual suspicion and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish is greater than that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 soccer players nominated from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, compared to the 22 summoned by the two countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San José National Stadium.
While the national and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a large record of inter-selected Class A games, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the Stars League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England maintain intense activities in national league and cup championships and disputes in European Cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we have to add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Cup football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have international experience limited to an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be at a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record in the Spanish Selection is that of goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (defense 0-1 in London) equaled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the Tricolore today and they will impose a new record for Spain, with 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona brain steering wheel, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other 100-year-olds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the forefront of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready for the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences, and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five exceeded the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still starting.
The historic scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at Stade National.
They have waited for more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
Bassist and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva from Brazil, last week.
The band is in the South American wing of its two-decade work celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day they will perform at the Stade National, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles group The X and the Las Robertas nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcription can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will take place in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I only spent the holidays in Costa Rica once; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
We are excited to carry our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely in the days before.
What is your message for your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying next to us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry that so much time has passed until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the last 21 years have taken place over the last two weeks.
We offered a two giant shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that it made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really look forward to producing ourselves there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends always went to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through the guys who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you aves offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never produced ourselves there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What is this for?
I think it’s partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and each loves different songs, which is why it’s very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved those songs and may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve achieved?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think none of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve done it for more than 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together excites us a lot.
We love each other and love creating music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't go better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we attended a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden on their tour, so we are lucky to be friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to be part of that Seattle sound that emerged.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many bands normally last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive, and secondly, we are all concerned about others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experiment.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t go better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure we don’t spend too much time touring because it’s easy to get into this game by the great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don’t forget that people are here for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect the music and what has brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn’t really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We've been a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record before Andy (Andrew Woods)'s death.
There has been a lot of frustration for the fact that she lasted so little and most importantly is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo of football I think of the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work with him.
He was a surprising human being and we missed him.
The Las Robertas national group will open the show in Costa Rica.
It's true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this was the band we liked the most, so we look forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it must be very distracting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
It is he who sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge high despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that emerged at the same time and, if it’s relevant now, I think it’s wonderful because it’s worth listening to music and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music than ever.
At first, his music had a more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It’s interesting, because I think there are songs on the new album that look lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, which are described as very obscure songs, although they may sound a little positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply dark songs.
I think if you grow up and there is a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things begin to influence your art and music and these songs, probably, represent that to me.
I also think you can be happy and even that way you can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori Hospitalized Again for Medical Examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for loss of muscle strength in his feet, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who serves a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including a tongue cancer for which he has been surgeryed four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, he arguably said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
It has been operated four times from tongue cancer, it has a weight loss of 18 pounds, and other conditions, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst of pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been purging the prison since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people for an annihilation squadron of the army that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to consolidate political ties
An official court, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and bosses, will initiate a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address the region’s political themes.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point in a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans resident in Mexico, according to the agenda broadcast by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proprietary for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that led to Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations of his ambassador to that European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to delay the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s "grey list", integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of tax cooperation.
In terms of trade, Mexico and Uruguay have been enforcing a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) since 2004, which has increased the trade of goods between the two nations.
The mustache plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the bad Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to exploit the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
“Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work,” said Nintendo’s specialist press officer in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" is Nintendo's "first video game originally designed for this support," as hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were so far adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and smooth game.
Alvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the character's return to a mobile console, a fact that hasn't happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo has a glimpse of the followers of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustache plumber must surf hazardous platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though I find novelties in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in Luigi's "playable" cases.
Colom endorses the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had issued orders for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of $70 million.
Thus, the trial ends so that Guatemala responds to the request of the northern country which demanded Portillo to trial it there.
At a press conference, Colom stated that his decision obeyed the independence of the judiciary and executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term, he had "not helped" in any judicial resolution and had enforced all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done implies an executive step after exhausting all judicial and constitutional proceedings to judge the former mandatary for the 2004-2004 period.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving his legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing his human rights.
Portillo was absolutely charged with diversion of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial prior to the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 youth at risk
The entity was born to avoid marginalization of untrained youth
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity are important: 6,000 youth at risk of exclusion received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
In addition to this is the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock of an act celebrated in a former industrial complex in Fabra i Coats, which attended more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping poorly trained, unemployed, addicted or marginalized people.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of leaders of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unity of the work done by Trinijove.
Alongside the President of the Regional Government of Catalonia (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor of the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Municipal Councilor Ricard Goma attended the act.
The present Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and La Caixa’s Director General of Charity, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the large Fabra i Coats hall.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the present is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove an example for how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in trouble.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-festivals, evacuated
The invaders had acquired 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51.
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of Rue Balmes number 51 were living has ended.
At noon yesterday, twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building they illegally occupied and where they organized micro-feasts that despaired neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
"From this day on there will be an access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of that of water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and desperated tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business fell by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub mentioned that the invaders of the property were making her unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreational premises had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors for the noise, while, according to the latter, the trouble was not caused by the guests of the disco but by the residents of the busy house and especially the participants at the parties there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the irritated neighbors of the area.
The director of the club explained that the troubles were so big that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgives him" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
Alberto Fernández Díaz, president of the municipal group of the PP town hall, requested last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common living and civilism that it caused to residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months the squatters had occupied every floor of the building and almost every apartment and that in some apartments there were flights as well.
It is in this sense that he added that “we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in property.”
Yesterday too, the Mossos (Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m., police moved to Rue Mont-ral No. 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the convenience of the convocation beyond the controversy on fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Barcelona Metropolitan Corporation (CMB), this administration printed Collserola promotional posters.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper boundary of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one not oriented on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is at the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with savages in the role of the Yogi Bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed of 16 competitions for all access doors to Collserola.
There is no doubt about the idea of a park.
It's that, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a theme of conversation for all architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme of which two members of this former caste of elects speak when they recognize each other in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three Barcelona architects, university professors, have coincided.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on the "mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the blocks of green houses has not been finished.
"We have to start from the base that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the title "doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it is not necessary to think of them "like access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The dangers that derive from "the uncertainty of the public space projection" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and that had in the Forum area "his swan song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its overcoming.
“It is necessary to think about new instruments of urban planning, because the current ones [referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can cause genuine disasters.”
By adhering more to the question, Modol considers that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Furthermore, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe way that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("every success," he says) that one had to create: "We architects should be only an instrument."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because the basis of the contest is missing a global vision of Collserola: "We have convened 16 transverse competitions - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that can see and understand the area as a whole".
This does, at least in this case, that he has chosen to participate in the 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the neighboring door architect.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately higher than that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legally powerful founder of Casino Red granted forgiveness to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails.
After spending 72 years in arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founding of the legal power of Casino Red grants him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Tribunal, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack at Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which allegedly Manuel Jonás required him to pay an economic quota for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the gambling house to operate underground.
Following the public denunciation, the Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal trial against the mayor’s brother PANiste and on September 2, he was arrested and kept in provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours before the Officer 3 of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Patrimonial Offences, he was transferred to the Detention Centre 1, located in the Old District of the State Capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when he was ordered a second order of detention after the Officer of the Public Prosecutor settled the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the criminal center of Cadereyta allegedly for having blackmailed with a million and a half pesos the owners of the Casino Red; but he spent only a few hours in the mid-security detention center as there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, a capture order was issued by the clerk of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás's guilt, such as that relating to the cashing of 1.5 million pesos from representatives of the gambling hall in exchange for allowing it to operate.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; hence he could recover his liberty in the following hours.
During legal formalities, the attorney's officer attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who of the gambling house's associates had been the one who granted forgiveness, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
Under case 197/2011, legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and no claims relating to the proceedings against him will be subsequently filed, nor will any compensation or punishment be requested.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling hall, at 3:50 p.m. the immediate liberty of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his file would be classified.
The judge shall also communicate the order of immediate liberty issued by the judge.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and seven other people lost his life
The Communications and Transport Secretariat (CTS) reported that the results of the accident in which Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost their lives indicate that the helicopter struck directly to the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the climate conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so the unit met the requirements to carry the personnel.
Furthermore, he said that investigations in the impact zone do not report the appearance of ground parts.
"In one research, it was reported that there were no parts or components of the aircraft elsewhere, the impact was structurally presented.
"The helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had an inclination of seven to 30 degrees.
At the moment, the secretary has assured that a priority is to get the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeroportos y Servicios Auxiliares, assured that at the moment of the impact, the Presidential State helicopter was operating at a cruise speed and this happened on a soft ascending ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of the impact," he says.
During the press conference, TBS holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft moved towards the border zone between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-height cloud layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew sought a lower height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was neither loss of control nor alteration of the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information so far available makes it possible to assume that the impact took place on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The model of dispersion of the remains of the aircraft makes it possible to assume that the helicopter has hit the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the place of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest investigation results indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,200 feet above average sea level, the ground showed a slope that ranged from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful research in an area larger than the surrounding area, there were no dispersed parts of the aircraft found, supporting the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find the Gene of Obesity
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and youth; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in children and youth, called the 'Genetic Protocol for Obesity in Children and Adolescents' that will have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social assistants had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation invites the entitled or unentitled population to participate in the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence to minors takes place every Saturday from 8:00 p.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that it is to know the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in children and young Mexicans to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and youth between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires related to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family inheritance of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometrical measurements (weight, height, size circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetic measurements will be applied to all participants (seeking to identify people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"Health surveys in 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there was a 77 per cent increase in obesity in the case of boys and 47 per cent in the case of girls; also a dramatic increase in overweight," the IMSS specialist stressed.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have 65% Indo-American inheritance, 30% European and 5% African inheritance, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics translate into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which deposits itself in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive assessment of children, which allows to detect whether they are overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors hand it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they must take to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentaryism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (scales - corn flour meat paste wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high fat and protein content and genetically analyzed in this.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid cracking
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement was resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand cassis per rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the pavement is completely eliminated, the cassis could be reduced.
During his conference A technological opinion on cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory of which he is responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to that of asphalt, but with a greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and consequently, the formation of cassis.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures of nearly 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has a near solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes breaking, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental and temperature conditions, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of material, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers lies the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he notes, is bathed an asphalt.
When the vehicles pass through by generating effort, it allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, it would spread better, the chemical engineer would think.
On the asphalt layer, he says, a last layer is placed called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide adhesion on the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the efforts, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer, it is difficult for it to come out, which softens all layers of the pavement and consequently causes bristles.
In the process of forming a cassis, he says, the first that spoils is the rolling film and only subsequently is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that vehicle loading is another important factor in cassis formation and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to vehicle loading and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent cassis formation.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to be investigated and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and make it easy to repair casks without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle’s candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to win Miss Colombia's crown.
Valle received her 14th title as Princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to content herself with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico has climbed with the crown and the scepter, the department already sums 14 titles of Princess (1919 Catelle and Melina Lorerez) (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Consuelo (1989), Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1989), Al Consuelo (1989) and Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1989) and Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1989) and Al Cons (1989) (1989) (1989) (1989) and Al Cons (1989), Al Cons (1990) (1990) (1990) (1990) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19)) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19)) (19) (19) (19)) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19)))))) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) Al Cons Al Cons ()) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19)))) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19))) (19) (19) (19) (19) (19)) (19) (19) (19)) (19) (19) (19))) (19) (19) (19)) (19) (19))) (19) (19) (19)) (19)) (19) (19) (19)).
Today the big question that many people ask is:
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Beautiful Face of Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won her.
The first factor considered key in the decision made by the jury to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why?" asked by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it’s a way of culturalizing myself, definitely I think the book that marked my childhood is “The Little Prince,” it’s a pretty deep book.
Now I am reading "Crime and Punishment" is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a very beautiful book called "The Heart of Blood".
This answer was not pleased first because of the term "culturalizing" and secondly not to explain concretely how each cited book had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt quiet and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it's happening what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the assumptions made there is one that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that being the favorite, the ovationee and the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Oster Gastronomy Challenge, the public’s vote for the best craftsmanship costume, and Queen Mother), “this awakened the jealousy of other candidates, stressed the queen and that’s why she didn’t shine her on the stage”.
And this was noted in her first presentation in swimsuits at Hilton Beach and her two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though at the two parades she seemed confident of herself, it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "Como en casa" program at the RCN Channel, said the fact that Melina was named princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who wins most awards during the contest does not receive the queen's crown."
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is actually the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the election, international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman engaged in her country's social necessities.
“Only beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition are already involved in projects,” she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle has sinned due to his back defects and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury has elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality had not been too notorious for me, left her points the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the journal Cromos, considers that the mistake of Valle's candidate was the surgery she had undergone.
“The surgeries are good, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body has never been her asset and she has lost because of this aspect.”
For this award, which the National Beauty Competition gives for the first time, after the show in swimsuits a cruel prediction emerged that was fulfilled last night, it was said that it was a little gift that Raymundo made to Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go through history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
This was the work of the Cali person who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano.
A dactyloscopist from Cali has gone into history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a dactyloscopist from the CTI of Cali went to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC: "Alfonso Cano", confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprinters working in the local offices of the CTI, this week was the "availability" round of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking adequate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of frictional skin, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the place of the corpse, he did not recognize it by his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much leaner.
But the fingerprints are not lying.
Accompanied by a Galtonian glass, ink, picker and lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the card.
His eye didn't deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a dactyloscopist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave Eliazar González in a press conference for the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprinters support investigations into crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false ID cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search for them in the database.
The researcher said that in a case of theft he had to remove a part of the wall of a house, because in that place the thief had pushed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to get a fingerprint from them, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint from the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in various thefts," he recalls.
The fingerprints may also discard or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man with bottles of drink around him.
Through the investigation, it was determined that a parent may be suspected of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if this does not guarantee that he is the murderer, it places him on the scene of the crime.
A dactyloscopist from the CTI said that the fingerprints of objects were extracted with chemical or physical reagents.
When they appear, a picker or strip is used to remove them.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the declining database, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of Colombians without papers," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is how it is shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything that is touched does not forcefully become a footprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is carried out.
The "indignated" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were shooting in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
Much of the people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, through a court order, the Manhattan square, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Great Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were shooting in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a court order that allows the “indignated” to camp again in that place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp again in the square, we’re going to settle elsewhere and we’re going to continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests,” said one of the spokespersons for the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the ‘indignated’ response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the camp and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the ‘indignated’ occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested a few protesters, even though Bray was unable to confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization says that there were hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the movement and tried to intervene in their favor before the Police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti square - which is a privately owned fortress - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation this morning is to be analysed.
A few displaced protesters were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at that time and they even handed it over to officers watching the square, which caused “some small clashes,” Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials struck the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or applying laws published after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park again with tents or other properties they used before.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but he warned them that local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn at Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were "in violation of the law."
Bloomberg said he had given orders to evacuate the place because it was becoming “a place where people came not to protest, but to violate laws and in some cases to harm other people,” because “some shops had received threats” and residents were afraid “for their quality of life.”
“The evacuation this morning at dawn has been disgusting and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers,” said the movement’s spokesman, who accused the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they did not plan to organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two-month protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescuer in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Canadian television Christmas show.
Private television channel CTV today announced that Anderson, alongside "crooner" Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will release on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for broadcasting on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee, appears dressed like the Virgin Mary by holding in a crib a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently featured a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV’s special Christmas show also features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who himself is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called the American Kim Kardashian "suck" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan resigns after earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends declining spiral in early March
Since March the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe in the Japanese country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, appears to have mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page definitively: GDP rose 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rates.
The one recorded in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - assumes, in addition, the highest rate of increase since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of acquisitions of equipment to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to a 0.9% decline in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use the deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened mainly thanks to changing domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “refuge values” elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and the U.S. forecasting unrest, a privilege that weighs like a tile in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed the yen for their poor results between July and September.
While markets continue to hold their seats in peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda Government does not lower the guard.
“We need to monitor the persistent risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Thailand’s floods and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) mentioned that most member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that the main powers are being curtailed.
For this dropped four decimal digits up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone has even been below the average, which is in the level 100, n falling eight decimal points to 99.13 points.
Athens is feeding doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to get caught up in the maze that leads to the exit of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic transitional government is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos yesterday signaled that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days set in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new measures of austerity for his new elections.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not raise doubts about his position: "We are committed to helping the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else."
The conservative leader went a step further in his pulse than the EU and the IMF, the agencies that need to unlock the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and made clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible."
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika’s inspectors would return “very quickly” to Athens to discuss with the new government “the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasizes Spain's "preponderant" place with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a leading place at the global level in the role of microfinance."
Queen Sofia recalled that in the past two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose “essence” lies in the fact that it is an “instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings.”
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living under the dollar day."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in every corner of the planet, and takes on this task with "responsibility," said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will extend until Thursday, "ensuring the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially women".
We have "reached a lot of goals" and "we face a lot of challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to drive "two core goals".
Thus, His Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there are 175 million poor families who have accessed these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are out of the poverty threshold in which they now live.
The impulse in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofía emphasized as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an “admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty,” the work she has been doing since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn on the ground about her loan policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at every meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him the qualification of "head of family" gathered in Valladolid yesterday.
Finally, Queen Sofia finished her speech by encouraging people present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for any democratic state.
In that sense, she stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said microcredit implies “a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty,” and now “more than ever” the governments of developed countries must work on solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to the people "excluded from whom everyone closes the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday 14 November in Leipzig took place without any real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned for the programme but was imposed in the autumn, especially to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which Angela Merkel was entitled, after their speeches, and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The Chancellor's idea-master - and the motion - holds on a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, “the time has come from a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU's control over the fiscal policies of the euro area countries, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is in any case one of the proposals in the motion adopted by the Congress, whose clear inspiration is Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile there and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which obviously was to strengthen the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but she also did not seek to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty ready to criticize the arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does sickness fraud mean?
After the grants, the UMP and the government launched the offensive on sickness stoppages.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, to visit a family allowance fund, and to deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a willingness to make savings in a context of rigor, but is no less announcer of an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick arrests.
First, for budget savings: the government is considering imposing on private employees a fourth day of deficiency before taking over a work stop.
Clearly, without a specific corporate agreement, an employee who gets sick would lose four days of salary, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but would bring in €280 million, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic significance: imposing on officials a day of non-compensated shortage in the event of a stoppage from work (they have no shortage time so far, compared to three days in private).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also revives the theme of fraud, this time targeting abuse related to work stops.
“The controls will be much larger and, in addition, if you are caught, you will be refunded,” Xavier Bertrand told RTL’s microphone on Sunday.
As with other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of work stop fraud.
Since 2002, it has been subject to constant monitoring and political offensives, which have mostly beared fruit.
The French are not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
First of all, let's look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million in daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and work accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
This is 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared with 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that hides some discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they hadn’t taken any sick day.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of the sickness stoppages were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to a month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are not more prone to work stops than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) varied in France between 10% and 11%, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leaves represents very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it reaches only a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks on sick leaves of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, CNAM found that 13 percent of the 285,000 short-term arrests were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In cases of arrests of more than 45 days, which were systematically controlled, 11% of cases were "inadequate or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases out of several million employees who had a sick leave.
A figure that represents very little face to that of black work, for example.
According to MEP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros in loss of tax earnings per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papadémos: Greece will need to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment program to recover its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said Monday before parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue the recovery efforts of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," the government chief said, giving his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Papadémos predicted that the country's public deficit will be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Rejects New Austerity Measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday supported measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to further austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of further measures," he said at a meeting with MPs of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the goals of deficit reduction and debt reduction, and the fight against waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would sign nothing under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, expert committee says
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where necessary, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
From the start of the game, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the planet.
If Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And despite the desire most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, Quebec has the highest rate, with 86% of hospital deaths.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also reviewed all countries where such approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said yesterday, there would be more cases of these overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasy is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Downie said.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid survey.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents estimate that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care with a patient, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Criminal Code that withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also requests that health professionals be trained to respect an end-of-life refusal of care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors to work together to provide better palliative care, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that it be considered, where it is not used to reduce physical pain, such as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some health law experts have already made reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts signatory to the report "extreme," inter alia because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide,” said Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Me Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
"In society," he said, "there are beacons and constraints."
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called "pro-euthanasy manifestation."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular challenges the report’s data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is becoming more and more isolated
Bashar al-Assad’s supporters demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry’s premises.
Diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with the support of Russia, resists them and denounces a “complot” against the country.
Two days after the Arab League’s suspension of Syria, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, took a position in favour of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria where about forty civilians and members of the regime’s forces were still killed.
“If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the king of Jordan, Syria’s neighbor, told the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomatic leader Ahmet Davutoglu deplored that the Turkish mediation efforts undertaken with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have resulted in a failure.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is adopting an increasingly harder line.
The United States congratulated itself on a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harder tone” in the face of repression in Syria, observed State Department spokesman Mark Toner.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have died in the Deraa region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSHR) announced.
Two other civilians have been killed "in exchanges of fire and pistoling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "towards the end of the crisis".
He also strongly reacted to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he believes is “a dangerous step”.
Syria "will not bend," he added, assuring that "the Urdi conspiracies against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "civil protection mechanism" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers in the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the crackdown of the regime that he believes is enclosed in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on November 2, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities facing the protest and the release of the arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov deemed the Arab League's decision "incorrect" yesterday, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy's
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future Italian government chief Mario Monti has demanded some time in the markets to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices," in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with the political parties yesterday before meeting the unions and the employers today.
It should set up a relatively narrow cabinet consisting of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups engaged in the interviews, after meeting with the appointed President of the Council.
Chairman of the House of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the submission by Mr Monti of a limited list, probably a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for preparing a government and its program, he stressed, saying "certainly that markets will be patient and will understand."
His appointment by the president had initially been welcomed by the markets, but concerns took over, especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the upcoming legislative elections, he said.
According to House Chairman Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament’s trust by Friday.
Monti pledged, once he entered office, to work in an emergency and with the aim that Italy "redeved itself as a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further rigorous measures.
The Italian "sponsor of boss" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also stressed the need to relaunch the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot comply with deficit parameters."
Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "changing epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "teacher" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and an "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The biggest unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must put up by April 2012 for €200 billion in state bonds.
Russian Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in nuclear hazard said on Monday.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Agency for Atomic Security (IAEA) and other documents from this UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, drawing extensively from IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and reportedly was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he allegedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then cooperate on the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA refers to "strong indication that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system "was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew well about this technique, but who, as a member state informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his home country."
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or did not progress, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, up 49%, compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are motivated by race differences and 20% by religion differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again,” the human rights organization underlined, “the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant,” the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be seen as a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, one of the organization’s officials.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, saying that this could be through an improvement in police reports on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a bit more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to more readily, live track the activity of other "Twittos", the users who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they track messages, subscribe to new accounts, have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested “on a small percentage of users in August” before it was broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to redistribute a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend tracking another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a manner more comparable to that of the mainstream networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users were debating with "tweets" about the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook,” writes @jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed,” @dannykronstrom said.
Austrian
the inclusion of a budgetary "gold rule" in the Constitution
The large-scale social-democratic/Christian-Democratic ruling coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "gold rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who announced this decision after a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Treaty of Maastricht, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be reduced by only one cran, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros in additional interest each year,” said Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the summit in Brussels of the euro area on 26 October: the heads of state and government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The arrangement adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present budgets in balance.
The aim is to increase public debt by 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen fort
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
“We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility” in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of force since 1945 against the green note.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, doped by purchases from investors who view it as a "refuge value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar rose under 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro dropped under the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This rise in the Japanese currency undermined the archipelago's exports as it increased the cost of Made in Japan products and reduced the value of Japanese firms' income from abroad when converted into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the north-east, Noda said, fearing that this increase in the yen could kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third world economic power rebounded with growth in the third quarter -1.5% from the previous quarter- for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households led by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister ruled that the price of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the BoJ had already taken “the appropriate measures,” suggesting that no additional monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institute increased its purchases of Treasury bonds by 5,000 billion yen (€47 billion), raising the ceiling of the amounts it devotes to purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market to <0xC2><0xA3>55,000 billion (519 billion euros).
Eurozone:
Rates rise, Stock Exchanges flank
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is still undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of frail countries continue to rise.
Always worried about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges go a little further into negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% at 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt yields 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With new tensions on the yields of bonds of eurozone countries in difficulty, equity markets around the world continue to make a part of their recent gains.”
“Investors, nervous, are too aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed by 0.7%, in turn suffering from renewed concerns from market stakeholders about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, is looking at Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalizes the single currency, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro has evolved to its lowest level in a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European currency is $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, met in congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Italy's and Spain's borrowing rates remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and that of Spanish securities of the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These tensions on interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel stakeholders' fears.
Italian government leader Mario Monti has demanded time for markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with suffocation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that implementing the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the “primary task” of his government.
Spain is in the market sight, as elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread rate gap between Germany's and Spain's 10-year bonds reached a new higher historical level.
Awaiting Eurozone Growth Figures
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
The Insee, however, revised the figure for the second quarter downwards, with a decline of 0.1% in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
And it is truly the fourth one that worries the economists most.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first estimate for the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m., as the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must override the dogmas.
If it is a topic that cannot be dealt with from short-term considerations or emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy that an electoral appointment is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear power.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will lead to a double of electricity demand by 2050, unless it deprives a huge portion of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity on an ongoing basis, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate disruption, a disappeared issue of the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear.
This is not the case with Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor with Switzerland, which just intends to build only the latest generation of power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name them alone, are continuing their projects with determination.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island crash.
While the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in the increased price of electricity, an increased energy dependence due to the increased use of imported gas, especially from Russia, a leap in CO2 emissions resulting from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all of these bad effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
European wind champion, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; according to which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65% and 50% higher respectively than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the continuity of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction on the part of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a vast majority of French people refuse to pay, especially as they do not express opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show.
Remember that our country’s energy policy has helped to build an industrial chain of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs created.
Heavily exporting, it drives a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets and makes them very creative for jobs that cannot be relocated.
If France decided to leave nuclear, it would sacrifice many of these small and medium-sized enterprises by reducing as a skin of grief the 6 billion euros annually of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years when its manufacturer’s decline would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity production, nor is there any diabolical one.
The development by Areva of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants as well as the construction site in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human mistakes caused the drama.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two unprecedented natural disasters that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift given to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the way to seize leadership in the unmistakable development of nuclear.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate a debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the engagement of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "the country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus between left and right on this topic.
On the right, the tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "9000000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country comprising nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't welcome all the world's misery" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left as well as the right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity towards immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande has a banality, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is perhaps electorally paying; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recalled in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among immigrants receiving the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and impairing employment.
Fears of the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants risk substituting domestic workers, especially those with low skills, putting downward pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mostly in jobs in sectors with shortages of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the highest-skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow job offers.
Positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants cause immigrant arrivals to have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the U.S. Nobel Prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average up to 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of 150000 euros to public budgets on average over his or her lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to pick up the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, being used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought of
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be enough for democracy to ultimately triumph over its enemies to vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
It is known, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an ease of thinking.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the prerequisite and can even become an “instrument of oppression” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first a crisis of politics and democracy.
In this regard, the palinidy of the true-false Greek referendum will have been double-revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have been displaced today, and for many of them Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to necessities and in dispersed order.
A white-seing with the absolute European monarch or a foot jump joined in the void of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but a common, rightful, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can no longer stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that folds to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore the leadership of the European project to popular sovereignty.
It is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will imply decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless of course they lead us to disaster.
After long fighting against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for the European Economic Government.
Yeah, yeah.
But thinking of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "do" the Republicans.
The Revolution in Interest could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a true European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let’s make Europeans.
"Contactless" smart cards are widespread
The world smart card fair opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most wearable segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transportation or to pay for your purchases by simply approaching a reader’s card.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for nearly 10% of the global smart card market (6,925 million cards).
For a long time behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe gains ground for contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the double bites.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To move to a higher speed, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distributing to their customers in the future bank cards equipped for contactless use," said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology that is essential for transactions.
“They were late.”
“But they should finally see a real boom next year.”
“We plan to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday that it is preparing to market an offer that allows its customers to pay without contact with their mobile phones.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front expands
Paris is concerned about the ties between al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Suspected for a long time, links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even stated that Algiers has now "acquired certainty".
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have uncovered the bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were expected to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators were required to find several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of calls directed to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly interesting for investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
“It’s a step forward, but we probably have to wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect has been supported by external financial and intellectuals and is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these “supports” have been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in its operations, which now involve the use of increasingly complex suicide bombs or explosive devices and the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened people of little interest.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist imman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - meaning in haussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Muslim Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is quickly succeeding.
It is politicizing and demanding strict respect for sharia while its activists engage in the struggle against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is investing in the city, there are 800 deaths.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will radicalize and leave its northern feudes.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the secure police headquarters during a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the United Nations headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now worrying all security experts.
While Aqmi has invested in Mali and Niger, while al-Shebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was “prepared to share all the information.”
The World According to Republican Presidency Candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival simplism and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
Over the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have multiplied the toning statements and foreign policy shortcuts, traditionally a Republican highlight.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans - often unsupported - fused.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the Grand Old Party nomination race, threatened to pull the Chinese to the WTO and challenge them "for manipulation of their currency," a theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if it involves the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, has almost choked himself in the face of an attitude that “flats” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also pledged to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to comply with his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing ignorance of files.
Recently, he was calling for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear capacity" - apparently ignorant of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
The Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in anti-terrorism matters.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the excessively rushing departure of Iraq’s “boys,” on its misrepresentations in Libya, thus sticking a label of weakness to it.
But the attack is not so easy.

The Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia passing to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event brightly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the banks of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline that directly links underwater Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the steering wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive every year in Western Europe by a first 1,224 km pipe connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Pomeranian Land.
A second tube should be completed at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And it is already mentioned the possibility of building a third one on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion of this huge construction site in time and time seems to be a victory.
The project was strongly challenged by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will allow the delivery of gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land passing through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of weakening the energy Europe, since the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has triumphed in its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, highly gas-consuming, whose deposits are declining.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically,” confirmed François Fillon by opening this pipeline, demonstrating how big gas contracts are as political as they are economic.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by Gazprom leaders, present in number at Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is made of concrete coated steel to protect it against the anchors of the ships.
It rests on the seabed, 200 m on average.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
“A hundred had to be kidnapped or destroyed, by precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders gave up while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state company permanently set up off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline thus escapes into the air.
But this case is deemed unlikely by manufacturers who have planned welding for leakage every 100,000 years.
The state of the pipeline is monitored by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an aircraft circulating within the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced into the tube, wide one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters second, he provides accurate information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at departure, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies have created a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for building and operating the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty renewable years, all of the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing for the construction of the pipeline was 30% secured by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work is expected to reach €7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to get back into their expenses, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas that arrives before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
Yet the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which designates a cotton polished used to cover seats, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travellers.
"Moleskine brought to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has become head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million coins.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its inception, now has almost 100 and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her booklets in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in downtown and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have been following the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies Moleskine's development: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has managed to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand can be found on a wide range of supports.
A success that made envious: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week for the Employment of Disabled begins today.
Despite a voluntary public policy implemented in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is still twice the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Disheartening?
"No," said Eric Blanchet, director general of the Adapt, the association that organizes the Week for the Employment of Disabled people.
“The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable.”
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"Nevertheless, there is still a lot to be done."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are many obstacles that remain before entering employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree and out of the 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to an average of 38%.
In short, so many criteria that singularly complicate the return to employment, and that "are the node of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
This is for the objective brakes.
The unsaid remains, the mentalities that evolve, of course, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entrepreneur pour la Cité indicated that the managers surveyed have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "over-representation of wheelchair people, mentally impaired or intellectuals".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law of... 1987.
The latest known figures, which date from 2008, report a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Managing Director of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of "taxed" institutions, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies,” says Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects true awareness, especially in large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of institutions of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of companies of 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What Happiness"
Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We will not go until we write that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has only praise for him.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go ahead," said the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in the club and in the selection, "it's a whole, he justified himself."
“In Lille, I am there all year round, which is not the case with Belgium.”
“I have to take my marks.”
Hazard is coming to Saint-Denis to finally "gliss up" on Friday evening in view of this match against France.
However, without omitting the notion of "pleasure".
Les Bleus, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always supported it,” he said.
Inevitably, this contributes to further strengthening the "particularity" of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalled.
"We met before."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomy, Leekens has for his part spoken of "proudness".
Proud of playing a gala match.
"Proud" also to note - as a "neighbor" - that France has "returned to a very high-level team" a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a thunder job," he was thrilled.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be sharing the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are becoming big,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You will realize it in the next games." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal starts with a lot of optimism his dam back against Bosnia (22.00 a.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, which he has been in control since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is one game to play, and one opponent, Bosnia, to unbound.
In view of the go-go match (0-0) on Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but was unable to score this valuable goal, which would have relieved him.
“It’s a good result, but it has a certain risk because we haven’t scored a goal outside.”
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there too boiling, even if the game is obviously "very tight," said an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that we can take over," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have 50% chances of being at the Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor said.
Bosnia's returned zero forced the Portuguese to score and win.
One null can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but it has a certain risk because we didn’t score a goal outside,” Bento said.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "don't give them time to think."
It’s a good idea, if you’re realistic this time.
