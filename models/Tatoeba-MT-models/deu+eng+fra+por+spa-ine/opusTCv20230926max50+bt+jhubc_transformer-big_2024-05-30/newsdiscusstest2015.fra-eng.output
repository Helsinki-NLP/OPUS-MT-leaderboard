The remainder of UKIP who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You’re talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS shouldn’t be used to pay for those coming to the UK doing health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he says yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted ones.
First you use speculative arguments, then discredit them by barely covered homophobia.
Whenever I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue behind chronic hypochondria intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think it's you who use speculative arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wing crazy, practically does not exist.
I think this is what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a towel does not constitute evidence.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a speculative argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity either, so you should be careful when you're trying to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's phrase surprised a lot, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to manage to recover.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I guess you don’t like when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is so rarely spoken of because unlike Farage and his crazy Thatcher followers who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, so no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis that is coming, the period of austerity will have nothing arranged.
Expecting nearly 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
We were boasted by Ireland's ''TIGER OF EUROPE'' a few years ago.
We knew the next one!
This starts reading the article again.
We are trying to make it appear that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a 'NEW ECONOMIC WIRK' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour march, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients there is no 'pave' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 80s of the twentieth century, irration was one of the poorest countries of the European union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greek was in front.
That their development was not a long quiet river, it is on in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on companies.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
According to a report published in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become enormous again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the corners of the street, exactly as before the 2008 crisis.
I've been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily caps since home.
Is that supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure that the comments will soon go on.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Does Ryanair now plan to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once upgraded.
It would be the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers a surcharge for the additional fear they were provided with?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I have never taken Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can be delighted.
Any article about Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair in place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything else than the basic tariff just have to get rid of themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays are going to be and whether it is going to be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying it was an error of the airport air controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your compensation dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes English ISIS to Syria, not as you say.
Happy journey
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crowded with the world.
People don't come in bulk for the quality of restaurants (some, mostly) or for the Salon de la revue à l'Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending .....
Do you think Sunday opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, full of world with 50% tourists.
@Aloes False!
The only argument that seems admissible to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy in deduction.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right that employees enjoy, except for exceptions.
This is why it is provided and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs have the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they're closing it.
What is the law for?
To satisfy a portion of the population and companies who wish to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal biblio is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
This is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he tenacely defended against fascism
the way of life he tenacely defended against Fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against his will, used to pay the estate fee?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others not terrible.
No doubt his succession would want his part of the cake, if you give me the expression.
His preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
I don't.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he faced other government aristotes who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having for these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings in the free market to collect money from the estate fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use tax money.
No one can deny that when this was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A recovery of the internal market through public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure works are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the minister, they well reflect the real frank evil:s distrust of dialogue
Return to Princess values.
Unemployment insurance reform is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either solidarily we come to his help, or he has the RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to the smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the tenant who lives income from his property.
It is necessary to distinguish between the person who invests for a return at the time of retirement and the person who lives from his pensions.
A property to rent or even two for a couple above is a vice.
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are overequipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in no way could a new deal be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline arises in response to a recession that is only a wild decline so brutal.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investments is crying: isolation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy etc.
A taxation that promotes high incomes and renters.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallop.
Samsung’s benefits are undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple's mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not for the benefit of Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft set up this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate design.
Some people do not attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and price top.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a “better platform.”
Is there a “better car manufacturer,” not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile phone industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and needs to be encouraged.
This is in our interests for all of us.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and it’s not an Apple product, even if I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Parisian bobos) could tell us whose authors they fight ideas about gender and tell us the works they just intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I like you, and you're a smart and cultivated person.
I said this about Judith in Furusato's vein referring to Holophern, a rapprochement that hadn't come to me (I don't have her vividness of mind).
Otherwise, in the background, since you are referring to it, this topic does not interest me, and sincerely I do not see where the problem is: I hoped you and your friends could get me out of my background, because I am slow but I understand well...
@John: acknowledge that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holophern does.
Who is afraid of the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us some elements of response.
The first invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second in terms of Judith Butler as a very symbolic slicer of the throat.
We see how much these studies affect the most intimately in their homes.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of ideas.
That's something else, much deeper.
Have you read, Jean, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: As for a debate of idea, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To pretend to fight ideas from the only exposure that their critics make (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Genre or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, this is all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I am not sure that the nuance is understood.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I was content with the "Second Sex" (that was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and somewhat offset the disappointment of sometimes having the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really enclose the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special flash blood moon.
Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey make Labour accountable.
But if the Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, don't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the Perseid meteor rain week and for virtually every major astronomical phenomenon of recent years.
I'm starting to think there's a bad genius whose only goal is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne isn’t really the best place for an observatory, even though things get greatly improved on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a tax on this eclipse.
Anyone looking at this eclipse should pay a tax.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last before you go to bed.
Who or what will be obsessed with you when it ends up (forcefully) disappearing?
It seems you're spending a lot of time reading discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Beautiful photo of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is colliding with Earth.
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon.
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so you can get an opinion.
Go and see today Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
However, these are the examples to be followed.
The reform of the notary would generate a claim for compensation of the order of €8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims for compensation are not justified.
What if the Ministry of Economic Affairs makes a mistake?
Will decision makers who have gained the political benefit from the courageous attack by the notary have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The next in its time.
Okay, thank you, JYL...
The State is not comparable to households when it comes to managing its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it contributes to financing material and intangible investments as guarantees of tomorrow’s growth and thus future revenues.
A few elements of the answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgeries, secure shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
By the way, doctors don’t make money with medications.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with medications Given that Liberals want our healthcare system to look like that of the United States, you should ask yourself how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
Perhaps it was wrong to blame the doctors, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize business benefits and “research.”
So read the few reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare global drug prices everywhere, as well as differences from country to country on what is over-the-counter or only on prescription.
This strengthens it is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently doing trials on marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that hinder them and the expensive permits needed.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are being used, those who achieve a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit widely.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone puts the chip in the ear of a manager of that hospital.
We can't hold patents on the grass.
If social science “researchers” were doing research instead of politics and networking, one could be using their “work.”
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
Comparing is doing pedagogy, not research.
One cannot say “the research is done, one must apply it” and then in one jet “one must experiment at all”.
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not done, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can one explain to me how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they did not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are just an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the use of building an indicator that informs you of what is fitting for you, a willingness to self-promote, a deception?
Only one clue to train teachers: keeping sophists and ideologists away from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
fabrice read the paragraph on the internships (which is unfortunately not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "This is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow the system to progress".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, we cannot wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern teacher training.
Educational theorists should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never put his foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to educational theorists would destroy it forever.
Your analogy is totally misleading: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the pile.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of fighting copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright, it will be enough for me to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
This is the same because they have to cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it is a copyright infringement.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without having the proper license, you deprive artists of their sustenance.
You can still debate pedaling assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won’t be true.
This is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of violating copyright
Obviously, you don’t mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what reasonable use should be, then I'm happy to deprive them of this fictional income.
Lesson No. 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they have passed from a click.
Perhaps if they share the headphones of their mp3 player with a friend on the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
Oh, if we could export that resource we are full of, the grabber who says everything is going wrong....
If it is a PS MP who affirms it, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they are old to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continually assisting them.
I don’t want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down are speeches like yours.
@gus I have been working in a private company forever.
I had the chance to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I am an employee because I know I don’t have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the null bosses I frequently meet.
In my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, when compared to the German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to demand reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized companies - What do French bosses expect to do the same?
Let the state hold their hands?
The state they are accusing of impérity?
@Jacques L.
Always this anti business leaders couplet on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as employment, as added value, to be so severe?
@Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who are moving and minuscule awaiting the permanent assistance of the state!
It's awful!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not to be abolited!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves flooded rather than transform themselves.
That doesn't mean that the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
We do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to get them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But the Labour is going to get us out of boredom, isn’t it?
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from starting a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And it's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won Crossrail's operating contract for 8 years.
Well, the Labour, as they repeated to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for joining and sharing and thinks that workers all need to help each other across borders.
So we can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps this is because the management of the Dutch is on good tracks while that of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of owner but above all new ideas.
Abellio is perhaps the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisee.
“It was a battle girl.”
God, I hate, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a superior quality than many others, the concern for others, the intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "beatings", who are dead, I know of leveraged ones.
Getting out of illness has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, we're going to start again too.
I'm not telling you that this is the condition for managing, I'm telling you that it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When in the examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
I'll start again.
Insinuating, even for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of an illness or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that let go, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think the opposite, if, having a strong morale makes it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatment, to try experimental treatments like this woman did, and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is fighting in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts in medicine.
But if we prefer to give it to the "Lord" it's something else.
Neither with the deserved nor with the courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get stripped of to the point of becoming just a zombie.
I personally caught two of them, dirt, fat, and if I "beat" myself as those psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of tightening the teeth, suffering the hell and cashing the blows.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers in at least that time.
What the hell's going on? What the hell's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The Communist becoming a nationalist who triggered three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
So please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the Lowest Rule of International Law?
What country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target?
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, it would be swallowed by the Western compressor wheeler.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was readily recognized by the Western states that then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now totally disappeared (ethnic purification).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office for not understanding the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn't like him).
To my knowledge, in Greece only one method of predicting earthquakes works roughly, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which would be “the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules.”
The method to follow.
Just like those involving animals feeling a threat coming.
Thank you Pastor of Science for enjoying, often, these experimental prowess that are realized in the world.
How would animals know (in advance)?
Perhaps due to the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
An a priori odorless gas for humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All of these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measurement instruments at his disposal.
However, we have no reliable results on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, especially chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art story telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognise the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly their modification before an earthquake.
I am not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we about these researches?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should re-learn to listen to nature.
If we look at things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we come across the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turned strangely round.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as Mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and he's always trying to divert with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected as mayor and he didn’t keep one.
It only emphasizes how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a crap of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in “Have I Got News For You.”
Because she's a celebrity, and we've instilled the worship of celebrities in people.
The Londoners voted for him, and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will kill the ceiling I am sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be a joke.
That's exactly what we were saying about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the sparking, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French were truly and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all who have made the effort to read a few books (there are some, including one French and excellent from B.
Millot), the “Solomon” and the “Scrap Strait” speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruiser, Australia, must always be there since the battle of Savo) do not want to return.
We have actually passed in front of the island of Savo, in the Iron Bottom Sound.
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
They're the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoking.
Calculate the kerozene consumes to achieve the goal totally decreases the concept.
Just browse the list of sponsors Only philanthropists.
Another operation is neither done nor to be done.
The cow makes you want too much!!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recite makes me review, identifying me a little while (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos of L'Elorn in the Moulin Blanc in the rade of Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of the displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to review us, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travellers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
I think the red hat that protested against taxes is pleased to know that this trip is sponsored by the Bretagne Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public agencies of any kind should not devote a penny of our taxes to funding the dreams of a few adventurers even as friendly as those!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation that are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once in Juventus and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they’re still in the team.
This is Bisevac, the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or ahead in the 1970s and 1980s and has trained many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the great Velez team who, under the guardianship of legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had scores such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful teammate of Arsène Prioacnger,
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was in the Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
Now, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to Fener and as far as I know he's not holding it.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania of today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there wasn’t too much damage (as far as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighboring countries.
How can one have felt “an explosion of joy” seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubted children are inside?
How ???
What disturbs me a little in this "testimonial" is that the only fact of having been able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice in the horrible deaths of thousands of people, testifies to my eyes to a "border line" personality of which all "testimonials" should be taken with the utmost prudence.
Undoubtedly, in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
One would have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically harm the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch powerful.
It's great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims eaten by their feeling of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We had a little doubt.
The Western "Christian/White/Wallian" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the general poverty, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this evil funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the conservatism bigot of the powers in place and the fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood before, must not push Muslims back.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess this is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive rather than about to die.
In Britain, if you are lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don’t make your grinchy who radates clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to germs from outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a febrility that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, snow risks and plenty of other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of children's increases, it is the amount received by the State that comes essentially from the Deciles 8 to 10.
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their taxes rise as a result of this measure , it is mainly the deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to graph 2 .
The deletion of half part concerning especially widows is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely undervalued: €230M is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to get it done.
Well, we're certainly not on the straw, but dreamers
For once the PS makes a rather left-wing policy, we won't cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the wealthiest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let’s continue and you’ll encourage those 20% to less work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm still saying it.
Save the Trots and the OCIs recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money serves only to make money, that is to say to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
Undoubtedly also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, part of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax should enable these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or then just as much to lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have social housing .
The utopias of the red khmer head cutters have fortunately lived.
I have done two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem. No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to present ourselves at the reception or face any trouble.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, keep it behind you and leave.
From now on, this will be my first option when I’m on a trip.
The logo has changed, the people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need some kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky.” No, it’s not true.
You just really missed luck.
From the link provided in the article:
At his discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, made arrangements for it to spend a week at the hotel, and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I’m considering paying a deposit and a month’s rent all at once but I’m a bit afraid to send <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Support the troops,” the Bu$herie sang in every tone...
Innocuous weapons.
I’m sure it will please families and close to thousands of Kurds killed in Halabija to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to anything other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the style of the author: "Seeking weapons of mass destruction.
We're all right.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if we had "they" worked 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't make us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college/high school to its teachers so they work at home.
Some kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Besides, it's so much the hide at 5 pm a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES of maths, come, we're waiting for you.
How does it mean you don't want to hilly yourself with poorly educated chicks whose parents spit on you when they call you a fucker?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Khurdish population can flourish better.
Where we see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, earning three times nothing and yet it was a job for which I needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 more a year and we didn't even request the patent.
I never regretted it.
Don’t worry about it if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well or you like to do.
If I had stayed at graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan.
I don’t like work in business so I hope to spend either in the public service or in the academic world in the future.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of cuddling branches such as art/letter/theatre/media/philosophy/political sciences, that is, what is called unemployed diplomas.
I have one of those degrees and I have finished production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career journey, starting at school and throughout the university.
Certainly the starting wage was lower, but we quickly rise the levels because in the real world what matters is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate engineering studies / arts fields have been ongoing for years.
Scientists can’t solve all problems, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in a way to get results.
Are letters, philosophy and art beloved?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about graduates genre media study or whatever the absconse branch you've been to.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are real fields.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the fundamentals of culture such as literature, art, etc., and emphasize them.
Wouldn’t it be better for a real territorial policy to decompress Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I see badly the inhabitants of the bottom of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise go 80km round trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-wall and small belt inhabitants already have many otherwise more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
Several secure and closed parks, as already exist in the cities of northern Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by the 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find room for ONLY bicycle hook device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, it's not good at all.
When you discuss with pedestrians and other users of the public transport), the general cyclists are not cyclists, but the reasons why they do not pedal the cyclists are not cyclists, and the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it's hyper dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that ride super quickly, and the survival of the bikes is fucked in the head.
Bicycle paths are apartheid, we must cohabit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the Great Paris?
Not a word about the bike square in public transportation?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% veil shifts is ridiculous.
I start to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Furthermore, after what OR reports, the deputy EELV seems skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket begins, it would be better to find out who really is behind this massacre.
Index: It's not Russia.
I’m not sure if I like the way the world changes.
It looks horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
An attorney has expressed his intention to bring the case to the ECHR, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they would have to file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yes, but Libya didn't blast Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other planes had been shot down previously, Ukraine was launching into the air attack zone against the rebels and any plane could of course be seen as a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents so that airlines pay overflight fees from the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurpator government/the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate in bulk that Putin shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky.
The precedent: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA's supply of weapons to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators haven't said anything like that.
To be Ricardo and to be such an eco-beotian, it's afflicting!
To be Polar is to lose the north is rejoicing.
Only one question: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't stop noting that those who criticize Piketty's book most virulently haven't read it!
It’s easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequalities-concentration, inequalities in labour income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today’s capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that lowered the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limits.
The question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is fair, we can debate this without having read the book whose main thing is to argue one-way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavement summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one that seems to me to be pure smoking.
The concept of gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity become globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the award without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people just start finding their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old saying that the colorful pervers are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes of happiness to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a bit strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she were not where she is now, she would have been married at age 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colored pervers”?
You should not have any "antenne time" on this site.
You yourself are a horrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father was not going to marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are enrolled and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, that she may receive a higher education and have the right to decide herself about her marriage.
Nevertheless, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at age 14, without having a word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Rather disappointed by this entry in terms of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a little trouble finding her Marlene Dietrich sosie character.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The performance is close to perfection and Jessica Lange’s show singing Bowie’s anachronic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I prefer to have all of a sudden than watching 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it's mainly the risks of stages and montages that sit down.
There is an avalanche of original plans in AHS that ridicules the aseptization of today's productions.
It escapes me a little bit to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to gauge its quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, you say so well, there are many other things.
Not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series outside of the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find the series sins by writing, she wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in Season 2, it was too scattered despite a few excellent episodes.
I don’t see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it’s going to end up like 24 hours.
Everyone is doing whatever he wants.
It’s because of what I say “I won’t look later” that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think it will be fatal to him.
But then, here, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk about less tax increases, please - coupons rather in state spending.
No, let's increase the expenses please.
Those who wanted to sneak in spending failed.
Trigger controversy about relatively small expenditure posts, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to call their vows and for all this time some in each camp pretend that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
“Debt” is assets mainly held by financial institutions in this country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I wouldn't see any problems with the government taking one third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it would use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage wasn't quite honest about how to cut taxes, but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, the subsidies to wind turbines almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as they should, you come to a figure that makes the Labour-tax seem quite ridiculous.
Your first 10,000 pounds are not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay around <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 pays about <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car sticker, and it's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30 percent of my money is collected from the source before local taxes and the car tag.
I am paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that this is a problem, of course, I am happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend that money falls from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of tax pounds are going.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for a door-to-door job prove this?
Even though, 20% of the unemployed wouldn’t look, that means that 80% look and don’t find.
As I am unemployed, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 hp, it increases my chances of doing so much.
Indeed, I haven't heard from the Employment Police for months, that means that the agents are more busy with check operations than really bringing job listings in?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you have to avoid Pole Employment.
What is a sensitive topic?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed do well their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transportation title from the users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
No one screams at the scandal in these cases, right?
Indeed, it is good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only two times when I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the cases, amputated by 40%, it had to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The registration and control is currently taking over, while statutory Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the issue of compensation should only be concerned with employees, they are the ones who pay the costs.
Politicians and French freelancers grant themselves rights they do not actually have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance contributes to the valuation of wage labour.
More than waiting for assassin tweets in Arabic...
In reality, there needs to be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit of prohibiting the Hadj in Mecca this year to Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have been denied their visa application because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted pox in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those who know decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be put in strict quarantine.
No one goes out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they get the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are healed.
These are not draconian measures.
Last week alone, people were contaminated after having contacts with people in West Africa despite taking “all necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let's forbid them from offering to fly to these countries.
Furthermore, customs officers at airports should be trained to spot people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be immediately quarantined.
Let him pass the message of the first individual and the second group (including the religious) and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt he is able to erect in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from this concept.
It has only been 20 years since information appeared as the given premium of humanity, while religion, from the brain, has led our actions since Lucy maybe.
What is the point of becoming an entitled Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not put their feet on the church anyway, only the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
@louise: Sorry the church has no vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envisioned was preexisting in Christ.
Hillel once said, "Don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is just commentary: go and study!"
Christianity goes far beyond simple reciprocity but introduces the agapê.
Your "progressing justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
Next step: we remove the incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who has disrupted moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be prepared to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice, peace, and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly explained by the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant between buying this, the new game Alien, or Wasteland 2.
The new Elite game is coming soon.
It's not invented.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If this is the PC version you are interested in, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll look at it.
Obviously not at work.
The computer department's joy-babs block all the cool sites.
Hello, is it <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% discount, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% discount?
Note: the PC version is only for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no refund is zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *do the mouth*
This is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll delete it from your library if they decide to harass people who buy it there while they're out of the planned area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France of 1940 a “putred earth”?
So say, this Nobel Prize seems like a poisoned gift to me.
Should we love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When one sees who wins the Nobel Prize in literature, one wonders whether Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano, which is already hard to read in French and describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobel laureates are more credible, but I honestly doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you read it at least?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso have all their chances.
Then let’s see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello, the horrible ones.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I haven’t stopped seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like the horrible computer of Superman III?
Hello Dantra, always hatred?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my medicines.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Party.
It was borderline.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
On Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner’s chance I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope if I get 95, I'll be as strong as him.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of slash on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, I don't want to be upset, but I think you're getting a little bit away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.

Either you have your eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or you have your eyes wide closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental countersense: all the representative authorities, organizations or associations, whether Muslim or not, who have formally condemned IS and its crimes, whether French or not Muslims, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who doesn't say consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval of the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they manifest publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt.
In my view, this principle is the denial of the republic and can only contribute to the crime of French society.
If there is no doubt, that is to say.
Who doesn’t say consent, but consent to what?
Consent to closeness to IS or the conviction of IS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to save goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically unsustainable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, “revenge” the parties represented in Westminster because there was a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified by the idea of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron has to laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are totally fucking Scotland because they have no seat there.
They can do whatever they want with electoral impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads off in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the “Promise” thinking he was saving his party but not realizing he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are asking for accountability from their leaders.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's the most important thing.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Turning the pumps by 8% at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on issues concerning England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster Unionists and she succeeded.
Yet he is still on the run for Prime Minister in 2015, since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind every reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.

There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic kids under acid.
It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some supporters of Erdogan think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot itself in the foot unless it wins something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will repose, so it is actually shooting itself in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The PA reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would jeopardize Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran is sending a serious retaliation warning or simply advising caution.
“This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today’s Iranian and US diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is strongly recommended to anyone who cares about details rather than the swings of traditional media. The short article you link to is important and should be read with in mind the previous realistic observations/warnings from Iran to propose from Afghanistan around 1979-1980.
Who are these “moderate” who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the pervers of ISIS?
The pipeline policy pushes the world to the abyss, and I would suggest to those referring to non-existent “moderates” to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
“It’s even worse than that if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
It would take a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it “must”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have a chance to be still alive?
A little late for that, buddy.
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, right?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirate that planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal were killed by vengeance by the Armenians just after World War I, and Enver was killed by the Bolsheviks in a sluggish place in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire.

The important thing in this matter is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics, are not the same merchandise of the bodies?!

It is certainly more elegant to make a good in a distant country via the internet and Pay Pal than to take on its responsibilities and or avoid the scandal in another centuries near home without shouting it at that time on all roofs! ...
These practices were not done in the name of the church!
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices.
However, the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.

I don’t know why there are so many disdainful comments here on what Paul Mason says, perhaps they’re posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England’s culture.
No wonder that Paul Mason understood the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul is still alive, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can take a look at it if you are in the London area in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including full of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story,” but here’s a small, well-written and well-thought-out article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.

The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never missed an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue occupying-colonizing (besides, this was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them.
The Israeli representative stood up angry and shouted, “What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) whipped and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not lower the guard.
That it dislikes the anti-Israelis is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
This has always been the case since politics has been globalized.
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it continues!
For the creation of Israel you do not respond.
What force ratio has allowed Israel to be created?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force ratio today!
Do you doubt it?!!!
Moreover, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskyist balls written not others.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A truly vicious charge, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand says certain truths, perhaps truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hold on, this feeling will become more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrify some: sometimes he speaks in a pretty way and after all the tabloid absurdities he actually makes it feel like a beginner populist, but the whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather cross the arms and ignore the entire political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles / videos that he posted, he says that voting slightly every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting the democratic engagement to both of this is completely unneed.
I do not say that I necessarily agree with its solution (because I think that being politically active in submitting its requests can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are turnkeys that will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it is raging to see all those condescending answers that say that this fool who says to Jesus is better than to take any younger ones.
Its solution is extremely controversial and it would be good if people were debating what he actually says rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yeah, thank you.
The thing about the vote has been completely distorted.
The uselessness of pulling a bulletin in a poll every 5 years makes me deeply angry because my vote really doesn't matter to anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs who report locally to their electors.
Moreover, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is intelligent enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are heavily influenced by the genre of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "Pseudo-Chomskyst bulldozers".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, for Suzanne to do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head shaking added to the montage!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but eventually became one of his fans and invited him into his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
He draws from a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media — including the Guardian — for generations.
In my view, this “frange” reveals above all that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the RDVs of History where trade historians have become a minority and where the exchanges of specialists have become poorer for the benefit of ready-to-think condensed Sciences Po type for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, an emissary goat.
They develop both very rational reasoning, but this rationality rests on these emissary goats, which are the key to their thoughts.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a guilty.
This comes from a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
We solve the problem of reporting to the other by eliminating it.
There is an anarchising slope, neo-lib and/or/libertarian (of both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire for the eradication of the state, the first knowing to seek the aid of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state/not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the state: without that guilt it cannot stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here.
Not a support anyway.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old times, that of its then god, Stalin, the grandfather of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet poses a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty posed by the mechanism of membership in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree or not with him, he is an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who do not tolerate being loyal to their mantras is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add to me seems to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other “yellows” I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I can't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were friendly to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
Chinese people think the same about white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speaking violently anti-White.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly wealthy, prosperity spreads outside major cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians mainly have prejudices against unqualified temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very fortunate to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the opinions of Australians about the Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It’s really weird that a stranger tells me I can’t stand the Chinese, while I’ve met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), haven’t kept bad memories of them, all the people are brave and, in fact, those in London were very nice that’s the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise you don’t remember who you meet, all people are worthy, how to remember who was who.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with white women, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these White women would physically assault them.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet she is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by strongly left-wing groups like the union of the magistrature...
@Marabout: Sorry, but the courts are frankly branded right.
When in the Syndicate of the Judiciary, he represents only 25% of the judges.
While a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it commands to remove two obstacles.
The view of the observer's political view as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
The law remains the required tool to focus the assessment on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, forces to make a distinction between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not divided between these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance are not subject to an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
Only by statistics implicitly revealing that it comes from the bottom.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption of the magistrature.
Subject sensitive in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area concerned is that of the looting* of heirs committed up to the means of scams in the proceedings* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession obtains a good an poor 150 million euros while enjoying the coverage* provided by the quasi-impunity of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, some of them were reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be thus spoiled, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria then an elaborate form of lie?
Surely totally prohibitive prices.
There is more equipment to scam the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, tailor-made to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, could never.
As they say, the taste and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson might invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog screw on a rooster.
I'm sure my sister would love the off-road tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra-long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled with a longboard inclination.
There are hills that they would like.
Prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price in a bike, so “you see.”
All-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have at their disposal a reasonable amount of insurance.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know properly that we need them.
It is not truly possible to say that Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I'm CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't get to the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
The eight-year-olds lived their entire life under Israeli blockade.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, since this blockade inflicts “collective punishment” on all civilians in Gaza.
Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little from their cement to the black market.
It's not wooden tongue, it's concrete and armed the lady...
References are here to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes through the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's sure, and it's acknowledged.
Two million people have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-guarded ground: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Also remember that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I am a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built in the opposite direction of the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you thought well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the non-profit economy of sharing.
Many are only looking for a one-night shoot on Couchsurfing.
So it’s getting paid (or at least hoped) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly with cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this?
“What does she rent on?”
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
We do not use the verb “to let” in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you didn't notice it.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers permission to do a commercial activity there (which they will definitely refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it's really a marriage
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and repainted, sinked, etc.?
The boats are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would always be near where you left it.
Or haunted by pirates.
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our ships...
Where are you going to tie it?
Marine Le Pen is not right.
Populism?
There is no other truth than the truth.
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
Increasing wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who defends what?
In 2017 the mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to become poorer.
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our foods so our food, with the structures of care so our health, with our debts so our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obesity of money.
Until proof of the opposite, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Minister of Economy at the Rothschild bank, a history of better defending the interests of bankers, the only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competing?
What do you call it? Turn her jacket, lower her pants?
Primary and populist reaction
We don’t know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure if Spee really “declined” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was swelling at the beginning of the day; I don’t know if this was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, you see a calm and daylight sea.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they stopped the shooting, and a pursuit race began.
Leipzig saw something burning, but as he approached, he saw that it was just a wreckage.
Nuremberg, slower than other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and severely damaged but still moving.
After pointing his spotlights on the ship's flag, the proposal to surrender was refused and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee found that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped searching at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned about reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, stirring in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sinked, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in confusion they deguerpire to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes arise at the UMP to demand that it be inscribed in the law that an elected definitively convicted is as a result definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect the elected leftists of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEE I PROPOSE A SUBSCRIBE TO THE WALL OF MAGISTRATS
When is the ban on trade unions in sectors already protected?
How long will this distortion of citizen equality be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, they are always ready to cuddle those who will take advantage of their immobility to hinder the actions of real politicians, who really try to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is to the extent they suffice.
I met them in the subway around noon with their small signs "Slots for Justice" they came from the province and didn't make a difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of its party.
It would not defend the same theories if right-wing, or even far-right, unions targeted personalities on its border and wrestled against them a legal-media war.
Your statements are totally free.
If, currently, the right is disregarding the judicial currents it is simply that it has committed facts that relate to it!
There is no example of a left-wing person who has had so much to do with Justice, but not all who have been the subject of his attention have been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it must be recalled that the left-wing union of the magistrature is not the only union of magistrates and is a minority.
That a minister supports the trade unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you quote is perhaps a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it’s no secret.
It is now wondering whether the "mission" of some judges is not so dirty rather than educating.
@gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not officials like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever return?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most glory-hungry fool realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone would accept their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or went to West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision competition, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in contests in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most British television light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into forgetfulness.
But that’s what happens to most stars who don’t participate in the competitions anyway.
Few are those who, after one tube, succeed in making others.
Anyway, most singers/bands can at best expect three albums and one best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name, has fans only in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it’s more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock trajectory, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar chippers who smoke grass in their father’s garage and swing three agreements on a primary school poem level will surely become stars and the only question is how much they want to touch before even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because sacralist ethnologists present these distant people as infinitely superstitious and pitty of ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired by ours.
Except that you are recklessly interpreting it in the opposite direction.
Indeed, rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières also do not have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as reminded of seeing the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article anyway.
It's ephemeral deco to furnish the vacuum.
Nothing else.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacredness still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the orths no scientific interpretations at all that last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When do we have a comparative criticism of disciplines for a little laugh?
Because what is true of archaeology is true of the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is quite unjustified!
It is through them that treasures are constantly discovered, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method was not very ancient, and previously archaeologists relied on their "instincts" and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays, technical and scientific means are so efficient that the interpretation of excavations is better but can still be challenged by other discoveries!
There is a full (and old) controversy about the shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (see his book "Les shamans de la préhistoire", especially the augmented re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do heterosexual men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could do it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we continue to three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the cave?
No, but we're not against a play on this.
We couldn’t watch a musical about it, but it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse has come back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, can I suggest you go to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
Can I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays true, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than laughing at those kid's ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go away, then.
If these “child ass jokes” shock you so much, you don’t have to participate, don’t you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh about it?
Nevertheless, we can find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Amateur video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no way that of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers, it would have released the safety because at the time or another vehicle (for example, a dealer) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (television law, pub, money...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I also agree with this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at restart to beat the English who was then leading...
You're going to be on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But that's okay, I have a little time to find out all your c******s.
No, just no.
There have been lots of conspiracies in F1 but never one that puts commissioners at death risk for a distant story of the possibility of one driver’s victory at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that gets out the safety because it's the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image allows the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How does it happen that the commissioner shakes a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners is clearly seen shaking a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that we are no longer under the regime of yellow flag.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the regime of yellow flag AFTER the scene of the accident, hence the agitated green flag.
This is the usual procedure.
The post of commissars just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
The sensationalism sells advertising.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid it’s just for money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having sex life, the advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news is doing exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that you don’t really need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so you can keep controlling them.
“When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch fear,” it should be “derailing,” not “coughing.”
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derrailing.”
I wonder if all the people who are mocking that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honour.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and solidly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media is talking about most things with that optimism backwards.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frightened and anxious (without coming to hysteria) so that the government can make us sweep when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that if we must face a fiscal emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from the crises it has invented itself.
Isn’t there anything fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing through fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still from this world almost 35 years later.
Moreover, at the beginning it must have been horrible, given the background of the 1980s-90s.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of spending there for years .....
Perfectly unnecessary testimony.
As always when you talk about science.
Not only does the testimony serve nothing: taken in isolation, it cannot serve as a scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@traffic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking questions to psychiatric patients when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say it's shit, it's a subjective testimony of no importance.
Oh, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
What do you base your research on, then?
About fantasies?
You put the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimony)?
"Resilience": the false word adulated by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think themselves great psychologists after reading from Ansemburg.
@Jim: There are lots of meaningless buzzwords in the psys.
Cyrulnik gave us the “resilience” blow.
Since he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has made us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
And why then?
It was a great series and it seems that those who get it out are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how will they get the kids to hang?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the humor pipi-caca genre, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's series.
The children were hanging.
Because it's a kid's series?
The UKIP works for the Mysteries.
Keep your Team America.
Still in supermariation?
It will not be the same if you don't see the threads and the animation is done well. :-)
I look forward to seeing that (although being an adult), but I hope that will give the idea to a chain to rebroadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped broadcasting here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years since we have had one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can still see it at these times.
And in addition, the half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old "sad" guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades !!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all Israeli excavations below and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have not allowed anything to be found.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Maybe in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque esplanade was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, this is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and has continually crushed it!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize His own?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
To boast of tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naïades half-clotted, allangious on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful work of propaganda!
It is a shame that the Reuters photographer did not take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians who were allowed to go back to the Temple Mount and who prefer to stumble the Jewish faithful downstairs, praying at the Wall of Lamentations.
@Mat, if this picture bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that one must condemn.
This system is unsustainable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be coming out of scratch, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater pay to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers will truly speak with one voice.
Instead of mourning and mourning when someone else is striking, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not screwed unpunished.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it is possible.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that the UK and US companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this can't end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that's what's happened.
Have you voted for PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that’s exactly what the investor-state dispute resolution mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people of the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have to our lives.
It's only recently that we're starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement so look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated behind your back.
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, sweat and tears”?
That’s what makes great benefits, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone to grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This man is right, in the 18th there were trade unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrifical dimension.
Let her (finally, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe herself the safe of eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if it is becoming more and more uncomfortable for her...
They still miss the union of married men, celibataires, married women, celibataires, lost dogs and I don't know what yet
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm going to unite.
You're warned, it's your fault.
Protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough for the defence of categorical interests, which has created a rupture of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of an official.
We can very well imagine a system that guarantees a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster assured.
And with the carts preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the topic here commented...
Let us delete "through his delegates" from article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
He will be: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of companies."
This is absolutely indispensable with the irruption of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read, and then commented on an article specifically entitled “The Great British Bake Off review.”????
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we needed to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I looked at, and I can tell you some have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in television history.
So, from the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the least worst baker; no one has done like "boom, here's my fucking cake now bite it and bow down to your master!"
Perhaps the extra pressure from friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept aside.
And there’s also the idea of “playing safety, there’s always next week” that disappears last week.
I love cooking, but I don’t think I’m going to do that.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us great entertainment and pushes us to try new things.
Going forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to set apart, I don’t know how they were able to choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the somewhat dry base (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glazing on Richard's mill didn't crave, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time given.
There is also the cancer that is watching, with solar wind strokes.
Certainly, everything is successful right now.
A bad time to spend for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to “chage” ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers.”
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (synthesis of vitamin D), to warm ourselves (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and lets pass UVAs and most UVBs.
Do you know that you do not have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a remaining when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was understood in the commentary, which itself intends to be pedagogical.
Not to mention that I'm a familiar with melanoma, UV only accelerates its development.
They don't provoke it.
For proof: not all tanned people necessarily have melanomas.
In other words, when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human being.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or put it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in this have established that everything can be folded if sufficient strength is applied to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for the purpose it is intended for.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a front-line communications equipment.
But for us others,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those interested in this have established that everything can be folded if adequate force is applied to it.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about the folding that I read in the comments today.
It’s hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we can't see how it could come back.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which iOS has not been properly installed and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know at all how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on eBay clearly show the absence of a FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
The article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in "industrials" We highlight super u but all the signs and meme the small business are concerned How to eat good, organic avac € 1650 (average wage in France)?
But to respond to your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put their priorities wherever they hear it.
For me, food is one.
Go without resentment, I kiss you
They are called bobos, or rather boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from realities.
This is the total disengagement of thought-reason.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example, claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartufaries, joining in this the left-caviar, from which they are sometimes derived, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this blend of heavy ideology and turtle also do not be surprised to encounter frequent criticism of them.
Wow, thank you for this comprehensive and comprehensive theory as well as for all the related details (plane, shower...).
I would like to be a part of it, but I can't find myself there.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecolos are monobloc.
Have you understood the concept of left caviar?
Well, you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
This is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in greenhouses at all.
The boboecolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fringe of ecolo because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at that giraffe in the face.
She's so badly done that she looks vaguely like a female naked.
Quiet, you're next to the plate.
One must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the stunning beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and still seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really succeeded in becoming fabulously rich and famous without having any artistic ability.
That's *art*.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin does not know how to draw
This is not really a true fact.
This is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can appreciate is realistic reproductions of dogs who smoke while playing pool.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will work.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still something to save: horse riding activities, the number of Republican guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty requires to say that France reduces its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastically, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, when we see weaknesses, weaknesses of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to make savings but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, looking elsewhere where the Gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have been alongside little or proceeded the military thing dare to come here, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without burst of laughter...
Applying the same potion to the entire public service and the public finances will go a little better.
And for Josi: really reloud: look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you’ll understand why La Défense can feel a little busy!
Well, yes, the savings that everyone agrees to do must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at murder when it happens to their home, the poor dear.
It should be done, but above all it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history is repeated at every closure of posts, maternity wards, hospitals, barracks.
Everyone is for savings, of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't look forward to the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It’s a depression to scroll through your Facebook feed and see that 80% of your friends started their status with the phrase “This Embarrassing Moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie about it.
He will surely rely on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus while going to work and only realizes that his skirt is back in his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally stupid.
Not really, I think the author takes on the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to hide his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have “the internet.”
So I don't think I can comment.
Having no computer.
God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm going to be overwhelmed!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so they finally get the enlightenment and discover the incredible fulgurance and insurmountable genius that springs from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard as a divine glow.
Oh, God, that was really naughty.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further orders, we are confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play the tartuffs at every meeting to save the planet.
So we, citizens, decide to take things into our hands.
With the Commissioner they planted on energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Wind farms and solar farms are the Round Points of Tomorrow.
All funded by the taxable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear discourse.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, on the condition of drastically reducing our consumption.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
Renewable wind or PV electricity is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to offset the intermittence.
Replacing nuclear power with renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insult you I am a Doctor of State in Physics 1981 plus I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I didn't say it's you that lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn't answer what I was saying and like all right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also cite the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and ineffective means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the water vapor greenhouse gases of the least effect than CO2 it is true recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part of water vapor and some in river water.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a “giant of South Asia”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a giant of South Asia.
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora box full of corruption and mafia.
As for ISL, today’s opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata Athletico scoring 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions India devotes to IPL cricket and now to football, how could we one day compete with our “noisy neighbors”?
The race to the low-cost launcher is paid cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect only manifests with a helium too cold.
So we may not be in a design defect, but in implementation...
Unlike arianespace, which is a private company, it seems soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they're going to pay the satellites in fregates who knows.
This is all the more unfortunate as many media loop over the titles of articles alone - and many readers retain only those titles.
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project while it is just a launcher problem.
