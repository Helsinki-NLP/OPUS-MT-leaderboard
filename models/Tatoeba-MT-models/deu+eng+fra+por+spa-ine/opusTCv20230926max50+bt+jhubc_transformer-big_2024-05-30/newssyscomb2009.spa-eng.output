Triumph of the populist right in Austria, together make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have brought according to the first approximate results, a noticeable weakening of both parties of the current great coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
Strong and special losses have suffered the Austrian People’s Party (OVP), where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZO), the head of the government of the state of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, prepares his triumphant return to national politics.
According to approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains as the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent votes, so it loses 5.5 percent votes compared to the last election in 2006.
Worse still has finished the OVP, which loses 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
They are the worst, literally catastrophic outcomes in the history of these two large Austrian parties since the post-war and especially for the populars who convened these early elections.
Even in early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the populars had a considerable advantage in terms of preference over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government crash.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculations were heard about the resignation of the party’s president and, to this day, deputy chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be achieved already on Monday at the exceptional meeting of the party’s presidency.
Such an evolution would obviously facilitate the path to the constant and more approximate starting point of the electoral results, that is, the renewal of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
Given that the strengthening of both populist right-wing parties - the liberals (FPO) have gained about 18 percent and the BZO, 11 percent of the vote - and that the European Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the government would repeat the same in 1999 when the populars negotiated with the populists (then the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it was a BZO).
For this evolution Haider clearly bets who has already announced that he is prepared to collaborate with any party and that he already takes his return to Vienna, to national politics.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament, although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party clearly exceeded the four percent limit and therefore is not part of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If the problem of Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles is not solved, it could result in a cooling of Czech-Indian relations, Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said.
The minister said this in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this was not resolved then yes, then it would be safe to reach this cooling," he said after the meeting that was organized on the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was exempt from charge and punished with a fine, the government may negotiate with the local government of Darjiling under whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“Their problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best, according to Mukherjee, to appeal to the highest instances.
Then he can seek exemption from the case and wait for the sentence to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"It is advisable to appeal to the High Court and then pardon would be possible," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the matter is to get the convicted "legal competent support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that this kind of support is already achieved by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it,” Schwarzenberg said.
On the other hand, as the ČTK said, before his colleague he insisted that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
“We really consider it to be a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists,” he said.
The minister eluded the answer to the question whether he received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
“I have received a lot of promises,” he just said.
A Czech arbitrates a struggle on the seabed
I approach an electronic wall map, on which Australia is depicted surrounded by sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but a small spot lost in the blue ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and alongside it also the seabed that surrounds it.
The region is at the same time as large as a single continent,” says Italian attorney Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member team working in the UN Division for Ocean Law and Sea Affairs.
His boss, director of the Division, Czech attorney Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
Rule this enthusiasm and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed hides a little known world, rich in natural sources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to date that themselves carry the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is larger than the land.
Coastal countries have begun today to vehemently dispute the new territories under the sea.
According to the UN Treaty, they take advantage of the rights they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the so-called continental edge which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
This has, according to the Treaty, exclusive rights in all resources of the continental border.
"Simply, continental edge means the portion of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continent underwater.
It reaches the border of the sea coast, and often the border of the 200 marine miles, that is, pure economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the given country submits to the Commission, for the delimitation of the outer borders of the continental edge, must be delivered with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparation.
“One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal specialist aid commission.
The committee has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For now, only those of the last three countries mentioned have come ahead,” adds Mikulka.
Not long ago, Australia’s success had a global impact as it was the first that essentially expanded its marine domination.
However, it was also achieved by New Zealand - the seabed surface that the commission granted it last week is 1.6 million square kilometers, i.e. almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of pains for their study.
The profit to be derived from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their requests.
They can do so until the age of ten from the moment they ratified the "Montego Bay Treaty".
There where the continental edge ends begins the oceanic bottom region declared by the Treaty as "common inheritance of humanity".
No nation has an exclusive position here.
The right of exploitation in these areas is administered by treaties established by international institutions.
“The seabed, however, is not a gold mine,” says director Mikulka, adding that “its separate areas are legally and clearly restricted and their contract-defined regime.”
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This achieved it in 1991 with a Treaty as investors just as few other states, states called "the pioneering investor".
It has a faculty to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is something larger than ancient Czechoslovakia.
The background there is crashing, it's something like a marine replica of the Tatra.
“A total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploded.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan added.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concreteness.
It reminds us of a small potato or with a little fantasy, the Shem, which according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages, the German special forces command was on the spot of action.
To solve the hostage crisis, the Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany – experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not performed.
More and more details are known about the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to data from the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior in the action of salvation also indirectly participated German special forces.
Thus at the site of release were the specialists of the German army as well as officials of GSG 9, aircraft squadron of the federal police, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation and experts in the logistics field of the technical charity.
As ministry spokespersons reported Monday night, German forces were not needed because kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted the help of Germany to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately, that time did not come," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
On September 19 in southern Egypt the assailants had kidnapped a group of travellers composed of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts.
After the abduction in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hijackers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible bailout payments.
Meanwhile, the saved healthy people arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the released hostages were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He did not say any words about the details of the release.
At first in Berlin there was no information about their return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", 5 tourists and special forces have to return on Airbus from Germany's air forces and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Didn't Approve Salvation Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has failed a large $700 billion rescue package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell dramatically.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected with 227 votes against 206 the government’s package for saving financial markets.
Despite all appeals from President George W. Bush and former politicians of both parties did not reach a majority for the program with which unrest in the financial markets should be limited.
With dramatic action, desperate advocates had still tried to convince critics to accept the big $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked MPs to vote even though the plan is not so popular.
“It’s hard to get political approval to avoid something that hasn’t yet absolutely happened,” he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investors’ concerns that the state salvation package could fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts have other serious turbulences in international financial markets.
To let the programme enter into force, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The organizers record the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travel organizers:
According to one study, the sales volume of travel bookings for the coming months increased compared to last year – even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened conjunction, the Germans’ desire to travel remains as before.
As the Germany Travel Association (DVR) in Berlin reported on Monday, with travel bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a sales volume that is 31 percent more compared to the same period last year.
According to research by the GfK market research institute, the reserves for the autumn months had already increased in number.
Thus, the sales volume of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher compared to 2007, the DVR reported.
The basis for the results are GfK figures, which are the information analyzed about bookings at 1,200 travel agencies and calculated approximately for the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weakened course of the dollar, travel to the United States is in high demand, the DRV reported.
In this case, the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The Germans’ preferred destinations are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially organized trips are highly preferred, explains Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and power prices rise, in this case travel expenses are "better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or with All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months trips were well reserved, so the sales volume compared to last year again rose - although according to another study the number of Germans travelling, compared to last year, decreased.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the parties under the open sky at the endless Spa, the beer in liter jars and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian costumes of designers.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don’t have much in common.
She is blonde, the moderator on TV and wears a traditional custom Bavarian suit.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is already worn.
But there’s one thing that unites us: we’re just in the tent, the photographers have already rushed toward us and filled their memory cards with the pictures – it’s very flattering especially because I’m the first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to fulfill its function.
In fact, as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany, my feeling of well-being in traditional Bavarian costumes to this day was still limited.
But after arriving at Teresa's Prado, everything isn't for that much.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian suits or leather pants; none seems to be paying attention to or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my apron gets rare looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A Munich woman draws my attention to my fork dressed in the wrong way: "The left is single, half is virgin, on the right is engaged, behind is widow."
Oh, God, now I bind myself from behind to the left.
"Okay," he says laughing.
The others don't care about many of the subtle methods of flirting and wear caps where it's written "To drink to get dressed!" and show, without asking them, their ass knot.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistly is named Bob, he is from England and is also for the first time at the Oktoberfest.
He looks like "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "or".
He tells me after putting his glass of a liter of beer next to him that he just drank.
Put it right next to the fire mouth, most think that's a garbage bin.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who know how to drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and cannot consume so much alcohol.
Around eight o’clock the sanitary groups run through the party place and have to worry about poor drunkards.
The toilets appear each time in a group - suddenly there are always four people who bring the covered decks from one tent to the other.
That works as with most visitors: They arrive sober, they return drunk.
You don't see who suffers from alcoholemia degrees and is on the sidewalks.
"They're the ones who can't do any more," a health care provider gave me the answer answering my question and disappeared in turmoil.
Victim of accident identified by police
The 63-year-old pedestrian has been identified who died in the hospital after being beaten by a vehicle in Essex County.
Carole Paulson of Chelmsford Road, Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
Since then he has been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey became a member of the European Union, European powers nestled the desire to penetrate the interior of this country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps only 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in Neo-Renaissance style.
At least this is what the guides say.
The building is set to the end of the platforms and carries in front two towers, one for each corner, all resembling a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building in its complex is a little decadent.
But once the vault box office is over, there’s no doubt what the company’s greatness was that this was the most western gateway.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "latecomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that ran to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Due to the relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, it fell low.
British rule and when forces advanced in Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad also for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources said it was sabotage.
Since then the station has decayed and remained on the margins of history.
But today, this railway, the gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party that is in the government – the AKP – has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a new cooperation policy.
The Turkish government maintains excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I went on a bunk bed and went to the Turkish capital Ankara, in order to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert in foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shaking, which produced the cadences of the ancient world in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, thought to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigmatic shift in Turkish consensus.
That has raised some suspicion in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and "power pastry shops" where middle class managers in business suit - men and women - meet early in the morning to agree/do business.
Suat Kiniglioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any party in Europe.
I suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
“The aim of the party’s foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey in its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he says.
Turkey has been cut off in relations with its interior.
Today you have to look east and west at the same time.
This is not a case if it is not towards one or the other.
He has to do both.
"But surely at some point," I asked, "Could Turkey be forced to choose?"
"Turkey," he replied, "does not want to face that election."
He then emphasizes one point that almost all of the people I have spoken to until then had almost recited to me in memory: the relations that Turkey has not only with the Middle East, but with the Caucasus region, and with the entire Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts return to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building, 100 years ago.
How surprised would they have been to know that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East, in large part, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting for the terminal the ferry that will take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
So, there is no doubt on which continent this fascinating country must claim.
Life to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the following year he founded his magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for those under the age of 21, but as soon as the Proteus sang its end in 1979, several of us were finishing the age of 20 – let’s just refuse to go up to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changing forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, whether madrigal or Messiaen, indifferently if unaccompanied or with complete orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
Frequently Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
That's all you have to do is sing!"
Its wand was always absolutely clear and accurate, although never taxable, nor too flowery.
Whatever the musical scatter, it always ended up at an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I met him very well during the two decades he directed the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I’ve reviewed more than 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never, by any of them, been disappointed – otherwise, I’ve often been inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two well-known war horses around the world."
We'll miss a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (September 25), you state that "in 1946 he resumed economic history studies at Oxford and in 1950 he earned a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctoral degree."
This is learned in a note from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he definitively left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career is unknown.
J. Vicente Resino in Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They caught my attention for their simplicity and the force they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feeling.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault for Honda's Bestseller
In November, Honda will start the commercialization of the second generation of Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
All this adds refined mechanics, which increases driving comfort and allows to save more fuel.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz presents a very similar line to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this van are numerous.
Among others, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before analyzing the new model, it is necessary to comment that this new Jazz comes six years after introducing the first generation on the market.
A first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the one employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz has been the most marketed car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Nearly one million Jazz units have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market has been that of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
However, Honda wants this new Jazz to increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese company marketed a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 the estimates target 100,000 cars, which would mean a growth of 17% in the European market.
With respect to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell 2,000 Jazz units in a full year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to greatly alleviate the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the brand leaders expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units marketed, which is 4,000 less than in 2007, a decline of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota, Honda trusts the arrival of another new model.
This is the Insight, a compact five-door hybrid – 4.37 meters long – of which the Japanese company expects to market nearly 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer’s estimates, 50% of Insight’s sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, once its presentation in partnership takes place in the month of January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its quotas.
Its length rises to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the axis distance to 2.50 meters, which means an increase of five centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not vary and is maintained at 1.52 meters.
Alongside the increase in dimensions, the interior habitability also grows.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the inclusion of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - rises to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the trunk of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are of the version with the 1.4 engine, as the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - in addition to exterior elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - is an improvement in access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, opposite 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines in this second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will have two 1.2-liter and 1.4-liter gasoline propellers.
Both mechanics incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, emits less carbon dioxide, achieves excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time achieves a high torque throughout the engine speed.
The first 1.2-liter mechanic obtains a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 revolutions.
This propellant - which in previous Jazz reached 78 horsepowers - has a 5.3 litre expenditure and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Regarding the previous propellant, which in the previous generation reached 83 horses, now has 100.
This 1.4 Jazz of 100 horsepower achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The ‘bee car’ that prevents collisions
To advance in the development of technologies for accident prevention Nissan has been inspired, this time, by nature, in particular, by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, prevents accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Chief Public Relations Officer for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C presents itself as an extension of Nissan’s four-area Safety Shield.
This robot intends to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand’s vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that looks very similar to Nissan’s Safety Shield.
But most importantly, the composite eyes of the bee, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterruptedly within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles located up to two meters away within a radius of 180 degrees in front of the BR23C, calculates the distance to said object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor which immediately translates into collision prevention.
“At the moment he detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by rotating its wheels at a straight or larger angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the maneuver of evasion is totally instinctive.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, or diagonally; it can only be moved in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and slowdown, to help the small robot avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act according to that data.
It does not need to save information or intuitive logic from previous manoeuvres, so it can work continuously with just a couple dozen KB of memory.
This may surprise you, but we’re not talking about gigas of memory, not even megas.”
This is the first step towards developing new collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced into standard cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite navigation GPS system to guide the driver to its destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Tiemble before mortgaging
It must be acknowledged that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make injections, is not lacking ingenuity.
In the face of the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on junk mortgages in questionable solvency banks, they have created a gentle and informative game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the bad credit hotel... or mess.
The tetric aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, twice and up to three times if it’s time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that it has useful, but little detailed information.
It’s more a teenager page than a place for all audiences.
What if the game is complete?
A dream room appears inside the hotel.
Something is something, because we don't even talk about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley sells stake to Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will pay $9 billion to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong decline in its stock market quotation.
A week after uncovering an interim deal, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley’s common shares at a unit price of $25.25, or an amount of $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the accounting value of the securities as at August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, ensuring a 10% yield and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on a price per unit of measure of $29, or 28% above its current exchange.
The Morgan Stanley share lost 6.79 percent to $23.07 each at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said Juan Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow him to diversify his activities but he passes under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Their alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s larger names to adopt a much more prudent behavior than before.
Modalities presented Monday also show that the deal has been changed over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for nearly $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the chief executive of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, “we thought the participation would have been composed only of ordinary stocks.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves.”
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley bonds 7% below its accounting value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert within a year half of its preferred securities into ordinary stocks if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. at $47 or less, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley says the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group refused to give specifications on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had relieved his balance sheet a lot since the end of August.
The last few weeks were exhausting for the group, which saw their stock exchange quote fall in half as the cost of security against a risk of defects on their debt declined.
This cost declined last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other only "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, on the example of his colleagues and friends, it is the third to put a draft for a new Constitution for the vote.
Mission completed as 64% of voters voted “yes” to the referendum, according to official results that referred to 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the suffrage plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of electoral centers and a count by a non-governmental organization had announced a broad "yes" victory, estimating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night.
The " Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians leading the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will take place in full calmness, according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points that consolidated the " new socialism " defended by the president.
The draft Constitution involves increasing the power of the State over the economy, reserving it the " development planning " of a country that lives essentially thanks to the extraction of oil by foreign companies and thanks to currencies that send their emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the Head of State, who will be able to do up to two consecutive four-year terms each and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and want a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of the freeness of health and education services that the president began to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives under the poverty threshold.
It finally foresees the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
19 kidnapped people released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the assault on the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts kidnapped ten days ago in the desert arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by the Egyptian special forces in Chad.
They all looked good upon arrival at 3:30 aboard a special aircraft at the military base of Al Maza, adjacent to the international airport of Cairo.
Helicopters immediately transported them to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical testing, so they were unable to talk to the press.
"They are well in health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana said at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages fell in the possession of 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an off-road safari in a desert area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, in the confines of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and since then they have moved from one zulo to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, in charge of the safari organization.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces members, carried aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault overnight before dawn.
"A shooting exchange occurred, and they killed half of the kidnappers, the others have fled," said the official who kept the anonymous one.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by the secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We have to recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of the intelligence services, of the special forces," he said.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
On the eve of the day, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted during a patrol an all-terrain vehicle on board which were the kidnappers, who killed six, including the Chadian chief and arrested two.
He also stated that they were related to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a statement immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent Most of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is headlined and occupies the current election campaign.
Better that way.
But a sector of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the miserable sums awarded to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government of neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we not have true laws that effectively preserve our heritage as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros to restore only the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it is written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Societies of History of Quebec, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped into 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned to search history, preserve with little money lots of private archives and preserve archaeological vestiges.
These are often the guardian dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and despair when promoters and responsible throw their bulldozers against our old stones and our forgotten cemeteries.
For when, a monument to history and heritage?
The governments of the Netherlands nationalize a portion of Fortis Bank.
The states of the Netherlands - being the first in Europe - will help with a nationalization of the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis that is in trouble due to the effect of the mortgage crisis of the North American market: the three countries will support a total of €11.2 billion to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend the Belgian, Luxembourg and Netherlands governments held consultations at the highest level with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s responsible for economic competition.
The Fortis Bank is the first to suffer the eurozone crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has occurred in several waves more than a year ago, therefore the decisions taken with respect to the Bank, in a sense can be considered as precedent.
According to the decision taken early Sunday morning, the three states will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the Bank’s property in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a portion of its business, including mostly the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year from the Dutch ABN Amró.
Fortis shares began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already significant signs of crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree to note that with its 85,000 employees, this Bank is too large to allow it to break down.
The company’s shares decreased by 12 percent on Friday alone, which is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the stock value has declined by more than two-thirds.
Looking at the current stock prices, the total value of the group’s capital in the market is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company’s executives this is not real.
The Bank’s management attributed the sharp drop in Fortis’ shares to the insecurities of the U.S. market in connection with the approval of the $700 billion U.S. package plan.
On Monday, the stocks showed a slight increase.
On Friday, they appointed Filip Dierckx as the bank’s new chief executive officer.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has given a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured that investors didn’t have to worry, they wouldn’t lose their money.
So far there was no panic among the Bank’s clients, they did not invade the banking offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in the chickenhouse
In the United States, health and life insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when viewing the medication purchase data.
The privacy policy specialists fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
"There are programs for the protection of personal data, which in all cases links the use of prescription data to the approval of the given person.
The same should be in independent hands, because otherwise, "we trust the chickenstall to the fox" - the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, designer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies depend on the price of insurance and the amount of compensation for the customer’s health status and if they believe the risk is excessive, they simply don’t make the contract.
Before, they sent the client to medical control and signed the contract with him already knowing the outcome of the control.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer identification number he easily gets from pharmacies the list of drugs purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws the conclusion about the illnesses and the health status of the customer.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is virtually incurably high, so you are immediately included in a higher risk category.
They circulate numerous versions of the program, some even set a number of risk, so the insurance company in addition to the management has barely anything to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the program is for example that some medicines are multi-purpose, for example certain substances serve both to treat headache and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first ones do not.
Special companies were established to consult and process these data, which before acquiring the necessary information from the pharmacies, request the patient’s approval.
Authorities have already forced them to do this, although they have not been fined for the negligence so far.
Some companies are also lately preparing the results of the laboratory tests and combining them with drug consumption data obtain more accurate information about the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is an exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and those providing health services.
The bill that gives the authority for the control of specialized companies for the provision of personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: therefore he developed his program, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another issue that such a person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the chickens, despite everything, are exposed to the goodwill of the fox.
Global Menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
Since the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue, in addition to the other mostly global issues, dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly on cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic power in development that should have more voice and vote in international affairs, the member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This issue has not been addressed at the ninth summit launched yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, EU turn president, José Manuel Barroso, Commission president, and Javier Solana, chief foreign policy representative, welcomed Manmohan Singh, India’s Prime Minister with whom they reached an agreement to double their trade exchange to more than one hundred billion euros in five years.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an excessively ambitious goal.
This has legally harmonised the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, so air transport will also be able to fly in the future.
India will sign the free trade treaty with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate negotiations.
The goal is balance, because while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi only ranks ninth among the Union’s trading partners.
The summit paid attention to global affairs.
Both sides condemned the Afghan and Pakistani situation and terrorism – all forms of the latter – and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also urged, although both sides have great responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. by 2020 it wants to reduce pollutant emissions by at least 20 percent.
India also agrees with this, just like at next year’s climate conference, a global agreement should be reached and the greenhouse gas production should be decreased by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to hinder rising food prices and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where - at a bilateral meeting - he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive orders worth €20 billion to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the international exhibition of the Frankfurt book.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The international exhibition of the Frankfurt book awaits for this edition more than 7,000 exhibitors from 102 different countries who will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as a guest of honor.
It will be the deputy secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities Francisco Maria Giro to represent the Italian government at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be institutionally and effectively present with a point Italy - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
An encounter with the print will follow in the Room Struktur in Hall 5.0 of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and prospects on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors gradually decreases over the total Italian production, and in particular for adults and adolescents.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire missing a year ago
The remains of Steve Fossett's plane, the millionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007, have been found while flying over the Nevada desert.
The debris have been found on a 3,000-foot-altitude high plateau in the Mammoth Lakes Nevada saw area, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Madera County Commissioner John Anderson has dissipated the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have the confirmation that it is properly about what Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said in a stamp conference.
The commissioner said no human remains have been found either on the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old millionaire was reportedly dead in February.
The U.S. Office for Transportation Safety (Ntsb) has reported that a few hours after the sighting of the remains, a squad of investigators has been sent to identify the device: it is own of the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada by a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from Nevada, some personal remains of Fossett have been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweatshirt.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The millionaire had won a position in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, the sixth temptation, he had become the first Man to complete the turn of the world in an aerostatic balloon: two lonely weeks of flight.
Three years later he had made the world’s turn by plane and without stops.
Among his records, he also flew at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv out of the schemes with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" all-terrain vans of the star's house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Proper to the out-of-the-traditional content, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication accompanying the launch of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition halls from October 17th.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, first used in Italy by a car brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the central street of the Milanese shopping mall, avenue Como, until November 15th.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue How it will be possible to see the new suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, by looking at the pictures you will have the impression that the car is outside the poster.
Successively, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be recomposed in a single image.
Undoubtedly Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something new in the stereotype of automotive communication.
Will this formula be able to capture the interest of future buyers? we will see.
It is clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In the Triveneto, the ban on access to sports events is played.
But who are those 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they never met the rival’s fans either.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
A small group (few units, actually) of the Campaign and Puglia have been added to these from Sofia.
They have three-coloured flags where the city of origin of the militants appears: Saturday night they have been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they have encountered a group of true Nazi fanatics, those of the Levski.
The Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all already with the names, so easily controllable.
And the Minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among what they had gone to Sofia there was none with a Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) at that time, none that had forbidden him to attend a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime at stadiums, were rejected the ticket and also the trip.
Now the Ministry of the Interior hopes to read the acts that come from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (ban of access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the disorders.
An international Daspo (prohibition of access to sporting events) that prevents the attendance of not only the Italian stadiums but also those throughout Europe.
Our hooligans won't put any more foot on a stadium.
Fortunately!
But now there is the fear of imitation: that those few fifty may be added others.
“We have to quickly extinguish this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way,” the Ministry of the Interior said.
That’s why, “well open eyes” especially in view of Wednesday’s National Party in Lecce.”
In Puglia there is also a small core of Ultras Italia holders.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (external information and security agency, i.e. the secret service, which deals with the problems in the stadiums.
"The choirs of Duce-Duce and the raised arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria non is a reato ...."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks the director of the Observatory of the Ministry of the Interior (has taken the position that was before Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of Trieste’s public safety where there is a holder core of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not reactory to celebrate the Duce but yes, the behaviour of those 150-200 fanatics that has been embarrassing.
"I do not do the sociologist - adds the Observatory No. 1 - the remates are attributed to the countries in which the event occurs.
So far this group had behaved well now we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to Mameli’s anthem: neither are they a reato, but if they allow, they are neither of education...”
