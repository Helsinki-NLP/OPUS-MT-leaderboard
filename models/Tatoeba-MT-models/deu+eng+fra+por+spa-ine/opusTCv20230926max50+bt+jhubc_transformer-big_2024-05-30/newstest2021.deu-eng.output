Biker reacts quickly and prevents worse
On Friday night, a road accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his rapid response.
Motorist overlooks bikers
A 44-year-old driver wanted to bend her VW from Merklingen to the left on Landesstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim around 9.30 a.m.
Here, she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist who was coming from the direction of Nellingen.
In the collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but still striped it at the rear of the vehicle.
As a result of the stripping process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn apart on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake off.
In his presence, he drove his motorcycle in the green stiffs next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury on the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a coronavirus infection at a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, nearly 500 people are in quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the exit ban.
A total of 174 harvest assistants were positively tested for the coronavirus pathogen Sars-CoV-2 in the series investigation, according to the Land Council Office Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
“In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population,” said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected at the facility - this was the occasion of the row test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers only for insert glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with more than 3,300 inhabitants close to Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people."
Infected people were separated from uninfected employees in the yard, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
“This can be bitterly revengeable if such local infectious events have to spread out and regional lockdowns have to be ordered,” said Jürgen Mistol, parliamentary chief executive of the Greens.
“After the corona outbreak at the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we already called for a special control program for farms with harvest helpers,” said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions need to be closely controlled.
This obviously didn’t happen.”
The outbreak came “with announcement”.
Aidenbachstraße Metro Station: Dangerous Dispute: 19-year-old falls into track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at Aidenbachstraße metro station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße metro station around 16.15 a.m.
One passenger alerted the police, which hit with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich (17) shot a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell onto the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an entering railway.
As the police reported, there were again disputes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled from the scene of the crime, but his personal data could be investigated afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is investigated for injury.
Seehofer urges longer storage of data
The storage of data is currently suspended.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data, instead of the planned ten weeks, for a half year, according to a media report.
Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a prompt change to the law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He considers it useful to "make urgently necessary adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently the storage of data is exposed.
A decision of the Court of Justice is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments beforehand so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be reasonably examined whether legal adjustments would be needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the country’s interior ministers, had already voted for storage of data in June.
NBA: Stripclub Troubles for Clippers Star Lou Williams
An excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), a Los Angeles Clippers basketball professional, is reportedly leaving the Disney World tournament district in Orlando, Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he still visited the Magic City strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who has admitted to the visit according to ESPN data, is back in Isloation and is tested for Covid-19 daily.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
Last February, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for exactly those wings.
The American wrote, "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, N.D.R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that NBA Williams has prescribed a 10-day quarantine.
The Clippers-Star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season final starting on Friday night.
Söder speaks to Corona status after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) announced on Sunday a tea-intensive for large farms.
The press conference will be available live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau has scared authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, nearly 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working, with more than a third being infected with the coronavirus.
The yard is now in quarantine and is locked with a building fence.
No one is allowed to leave the site, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the municipality’s more than 3,300 inhabitants.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Land Council has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bisses": confession of the alleged firefighter of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was “plagued by bites of conscience and very accompanied by the extent of destruction.”
In case of conviction, the man is threatened with ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor’s office.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire last Saturday night.
The fire broke out at three places far from each other in the church.
Laboratory tests hardened the suspicion of burning.
The suspect was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man worked as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no evidence of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came to the sight of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended considering the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
“German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts,” Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
"For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous in Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
As such, we do not come around the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors in clubs that want to break into this phalanx.”
But he has doubts about whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
“There remains a legal risk of moving investment fences around the Bundesliga business location in a European single market,” Grindel said.
The former DFB chief sees the risk that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are enormous among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million,” said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and stabbed the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It has been very humanly busy.”
The gift worth about 11,000 euros he had received from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw the consequences from it,” Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have dealt with completely transparent and recklessly.
Many people in the DFB knew about it.”
“He never made a hole out of the gift,” the 58-year-old said.
“It may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption.”
"Black Lives Matter": Wounded and a Dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have been revived by Donald Trump’s deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes in various cities between demonstrators and police officers.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by shots while a demonstration train just crossed a crossing.
Before that, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
Security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and forced demonstrators out.
Hundreds of demonstrators marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held responsible.
The 26-year-old student was shot in a drug razzia in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found either.
On Saturday, when a member of a group calling himself an armed alliance of black Americans shot, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
Police have reportedly held a suspect in custody.
She has not provided any details on the circumstances of the crime so far.
Mayor Steve Adler said, according to the New York Times, he was “unconsoled and astonished” by what had happened, as many in the city.
In the U.S. metropolis of Seattle, demonstrators also made clashes with police on Saturday.
They set fire in front of a youth prison construction carriage, the police used blend grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police or injury.
In Oakland, California, a court building was set on fire.
A small group of protesters struck windows, shot fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night.
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police reported that one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital injured.
Also, windows were hit in a courthouse and a fire was set, police said.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and actors enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, actors and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: even though the large party mile in downtown was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale, Rakoczy ball or festivity were burning, many came at their expense in the Corona-compliant alternative program.
“I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair,” says Currency Director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, we return to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, as only the historical ones were the focus of the festival.
Nice atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time, too, in the Corona year.
The couple have made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watching the historical while flaning and listening to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
“I think it’s very pleasant,” Konhäuser says.
They miss the crowds that otherwise do not belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, you lack the usual program highlights, especially the halls burning on Friday evening, as well as the historic celebration and the closing firework on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year,” she says.
Rakoczy riding tournament will be held again
For the performers of the historical guests, the alternative program partly meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who works on the festival in a normal year and can be seen there on the coach of the spa garden cafe.
This year she was walking around the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costumes.
“It’s more exhausting, otherwise we’ll have it easier,” she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the way in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quad will be able to take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will be held again.
28 Corona cases at Spanish Second League Fuenlabrada
Spanish second-league footballer CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newbie from near Madrid, despite the first Corona cases, flew to a game in the city of A Coruña on July 20, a low strike follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid has yet to have a chance to reach the playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-Group of the Second League is threatened.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office investigated for a possible offence against public health, the top sports authority CSD considers the club's forced descent.
The players and other team members are sitting in a quarantine hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper "AS" wrote.
Photos show players hanging underwear and club clothing in their rooms at the hotel for drying after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was also not changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
It is neither good nor sufficient, he wrote.
The club manager said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The allegation of deliberately jeopardizing public health was rejected by the club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
Corona rules have not been violated by the football association, the son of Spanish Primera Division president Javier Tebas said, according to the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Prior to departure, there were four infected persons until July 19, but they were all isolated and not attended.
Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, five or six other team members of the Corona test were positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the pitch, said Tebas Llanas.
Police have to catch ripped horses at steam compartment
Two animals were on the road.
The police brought her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning just before 6 a.m., a road user shared two free-run horses on the feeder between the mouth of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the motorway terminal Theres.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already between the feeder and the town Steamfach.
After the officials were able to gain the trust of the horses shortly before the steam compartment, they each were killed with a rope carried in the strip carriage.
Cycling professional Tony Martin: Career continuation imaginable
Time racing specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time time racing world champion Tony Martin can well imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just sharing the framework with the team, how and in what form it could go on," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurt Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently working with the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would hurt him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he stood up after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Quickly back on the wheel.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I think, what if?"
The cycling professional admitted that there are certainly aspects that are increasingly difficult for him.
“But it was good for me to realize what I have in cycling and how much fun I enjoy it, based on the Corona time.”
The time-travel specialist returns to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria’s roads on weekends
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the tour ends fatal with the motorcycle.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schonthal - In accidents on Bavaria's streets, several people, mostly young people, died on the weekend.
A 18-year-old motorcycle rider was caught by a car on Saturday near Schönthal (Cham district) that hit the counter track.
Why the car hit the counter track was unclear at first.
In Upper Bavaria, on Saturday, a 22-year-old hit his machine with a horse carriage.
According to police, he was downhill at Beilngries.
In a left curve, he clashed against the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the accident site.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one man was severely injured and one man was slightly injured, police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old man died in Bad Kötzting.
He had lying on a road on Sunday night and was overwhelmed by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau district) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker crashed in a right-wing curve despite full braking frontally against a car.
He died at the accident site.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the remaining three people in the car remained uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organiser of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister pointed to extensive investments such as underdriving protection on guide planks and the debursement of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot for the safety of motorcyclists in recent years," the letter said.
“The number of motorized two-cycle riders killed decreased by about 28 percent compared to 2011.”
Kovac tests Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac, his new club AS Monaco will soon meet again with Eintracht Frankfurt.
The eight-time French champion will be hosted on 1 August (18.00 o’clock) at the Hesse, the former club of the Croatian.
For the Bundesliga player, it is the first and only hard test before the Europa League back against FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is held without spectators.
“We are especially looking forward to this game.
It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac said.
This is an interesting test in sports, the 48-year-old said.
Prior to his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the match against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at the Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eighth-final match against Basel at their own stadium with 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past the lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known corona new infections on the weekend has increased further: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is recovered and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the town court.
With this, the space court approaches the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
700 dead from monsoon rain in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people died as a result of the heavy monsoon rain.
In Bangladesh, the Red Halfmoon strives in boats to reach the isolated people.
All villages are underwater.
The farmers lost their crops.
Tank nose horns in National Park die from earthslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank nosehorns died from earthslides.
They are protected and endangered by extinction.
This year’s floods are particularly bad, leading to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazaar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 displaced people.
So far, few have moved.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also remains in Grenada.
Those who once had a house, it was as small as it was and resembled a cottage, often do not want to spend their lives in a large block.
Many homes are empty, but - so the government wants it - will soon be acquired by those who have lost their homes due to the floods.

Argentina rejects creditors' counter-proposal
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economics in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
“It would be not only irresponsible, but also unjust,” he said in a statement.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors.”
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer viable under current conditions.
This is why Argentina calls on its private creditors to waive a portion of its claims of around $66 billion (about €59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina’s history.
Lastly, lenders demanded higher interest rates on state bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
However, the Argentine government holds on to its last offer and is not ready to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate last time was more than 50 percent.
Experts expect economic power to decline by about 10 percent for the current year.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to pay $503 million in interest claims, which resulted in a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going super well" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary office.
Already six weeks later, in early July, the doctoral lawyer started working, normal day-to-day business has long been running on full tours.
"I still have to arrive privately, though," she explains in a conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time, of course, was not enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, the native Dingolfingerin reports.
Currently, she and her husband, who works as a judge in the County Court in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was still able to apply for short-term parental leave to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to pendulate from Regensburg every day, she also had a nightlife with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the town of Eggenfelden has of course long been a term for her.
When visiting the site with her family in the past few months, she once again noted: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Stefanie Kramer also played a central role in her professional career in Lower Bavaria: after her law studies in Passau she completed her referendum period and the 2nd state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notaressessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "beside" the doctorate in labour law - she entered her first position as a notar in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notary offices.
When the job was announced in Eggenfelden because of Lutz Feller’s approaching retirement, she saw the right time for her full career re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the vacation office at the notary office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and is ready to praise the team of the law firm: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded procedures makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten or crib spaces, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here too soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled at 20 percent for the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we are planning to have between 12,000 and 15,000 spectators at the current stage," Borussia Dortmund's CEO Carsten Cramer told Tagesspiegel.
Usually, the Arena in the Revierstadt holds slightly more than 81,000 spectators in Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the corona pandemic last season, the BVB lost about four million euros per game.
Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at the BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectators, some of the approximately 4,000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the account if these revenues break completely away".
Given the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "good advice to take a stable side length for the first time."
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are short-working in Germany alone, then the need is limited to entertainment,” Cramer said.
The Dortmund Marketing Chief praised the BVB professionals for their part-salary waiver, which is meant to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their waiver has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in merchandising on short work."
Tiny Miracles: Early Starting with a few Hundreds of Grams
Heavier than a Packerl butter, only three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 preterm babies cared for annually at the Graz Kinderklinik.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Sometimes their skin is so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that sometimes they wear doll clothes and mini winders specially made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn’t be at the voice – “and like,” says Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they do not scream as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona theatre in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the St. James gymnasium in Abtsgmund shortly before the holiday started.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater of the city of Aalen presented to the students the production "Das Heimatkleid" - and that by video.
Subsequently, the students were able to talk via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of teaching.
Although at the end all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional stimuli, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
“If we continue to improve the technical framework, that could become an interesting addition to the game operation,” said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would hit Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are set.
The lions would hit Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening at the ARD Sports Show.
Because of the corona pandemic the participant field is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If second-league ascendant Würzburg reached the final, Sixty would already be fixed for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to stand up in the final against regional league Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between September 11 and 14, thus a week before the third league start.
"From the Wind": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died Sunday in Paris at the age of 104 of a natural death, her spokeswoman for the German press agency confirmed.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic "Von der Wind" (1939).
Born in Tokyo as a child of British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
Austrian theaterman Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night Dream".
The Warner Brothers film studio immediately contracted them for seven years and brought them out big alongside Eroll Flynn.
Eight films she made with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the role of "To Each His Own".
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mother Heart".
Three years later, the award came as best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She was also awarded much recognition as a neurotic eccentrician in "Der Darkspiegel" and "Die Snakegrotte".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her in 1952 for the lead role in the filming of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The play was a worldwide success.
With her long-time girlfriend Bette Davis she played in "Wiegensang for a Body".
From the marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946-1953) the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed, however.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach Volleyball: Thole/Wickler missing final at Comeback
Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final in the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the top teams meeting in Düsseldorf, they submitted their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen to the semi-finals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler played last year at the World Tour Final in Rome in September.
In the final game on the Rhine, their defeaters Ehlers/Flügen defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting points for the German championships were played in early September at Timmendorfer Strand: the tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz release from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the viewpoint of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Directors had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about removing right-wing extremists from their party consistently, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have long been excluded," Strasser said.
“But there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party.”
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz remains excluded now, says nothing and changes nothing," he said to the "Welt am Sonntag".
Instead, there are volumes of how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD.
Flower expects that the AfD will land again below 5% in elections in the future.
“The days of the AfD in parliaments are counted.”
Kalbitz was one of the leaders of the officially dissolved "wing" around Thuringian AfD country and fraction chairman Björn Höcke; constitutional protection classifies the stroning as a "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD Federal Chairman had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not indicate a former membership of the now banned far-right "Heimatloyal German Youth" (HDJ) and with the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Fraction in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without calbitz.
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The Meuthen troop maneuver is clear.
One wants to avoid further observation through constitutional protection and tries to get through the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD won't let go of the ghosts she called.
An expulsion doesn’t change yet,” commented SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn in Brandenburg on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD country association and the fraction kept their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute about Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he will now take civil law against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms supply 21% more electricity
The wind power plants in the German North Sea have supplied 11.51 terawatt-hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is about 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, network operator Tennet said in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind farms on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet’s network area, have supplied another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind flow from the North and Baltic Sea is 13.73 TWh, compared with 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results, in addition to wind conditions, from higher production capacities, as new wind farms have gone to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; it is 7.1 gigawatts according to Tennet.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands we have invested 20 billion euros to expand offshore network connections,” said Tennet CEO Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms can’t use their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms produced more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
Nearly seven million households could be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipziger artist Christian Bold in the Gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold exploded the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was delivered by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was engaged.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival is not taking place this year.
The city of Freital canceled the three-day festival scheduled for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really didn't make this decision easy for ourselves and, aware of how economically heavy it is for the stakeholders, we hoped to the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg.
“But ultimately, as an organizer, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here.”
Because if tens of thousands had flown to the feast grounds and into the feast tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not have been complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
Furthermore, the organizational and monitoring costs would increase disproportionately by several times.
Rumberg was sorry for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary, including the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic winner Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider in the Dressage tournament in Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins on the weekend at four starts.
After winning a Grand Prix with consecrated gold and Quantaz for the opening, she was not able to beat in the Grand Prix Special and in the cutter on Sunday.
At the 15-year-old Stute Weihegold on Sunday, Werth played in the special against Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
The Germans also lay on Quantaz on Saturday clearly in front of their 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Worth's winner horse Quantaz belongs to Max Theurer.
The world’s most successful dressage rider is set to establish the ten-year-old hanger in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first cutter ever.
Even in the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four major tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air controllers in Worms in the future
The Wormser Hochschule continues to go into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is granting a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility of enabling the start of the study not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacity of both the university and the air navigation academy of the DFS is equally exploited.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students in the course of their flight controller training at Worms University of Applied Sciences have been in the Air Traffic Management program.
This year, nine students started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the students’ achievements are excellent.
The combination of study and lots training contributes significantly to further increase the attractiveness of the lots profession.
“In these times, economic support is not easy for us.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue fulfilling our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and Managing Director of DFS when signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation Professorship is a future-proofing investment that will provide long-term air controllers with a broad, technically comprehensive knowledge base.
We therefore continue to work well with the university and at the same time reinforce our attractiveness as an employer.”
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences, said: "The foundation professorship is an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to link to the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor program Air Traffic Management."
The trust of the German air traffic agency is both the motivation and the obligation of the University of Worms to further develop its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
In use for tomorrow’s air controllers, the university with its first foundation professorship for a dual degree program could set very special highlights and innovative focuses for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasizes: "Worms University has a unique feature with its focus on air transport in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today’s signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university.”
Rescue helicopter lands on A 45
Approximately 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon, the motorway A 45 was fully locked towards Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopters were in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man drove straight in the curve with a Ford around 12.40 a.m. at the exit Alzenau-Mitte and landed at the steering board.
As a result of the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered slight injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were supplied by the emergency physician and the patient then flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
Currently, however, the police assume that there is no life threat.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about 2,000 euros, had to be slipped off.
Heil wants to examine other industries by meat industry
The Corona crisis brought back to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Restrictions of law are about to come.
Are they righteous, and will they remain righteous?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
“We will look at the industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary,” said Heil at the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Germany’s employers already warn against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to pass a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel for slaughter, decomposition and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of work contracts and temporary workers there will be prohibited.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said: "Finger away from a general restriction of employment contracts and employee discharge if you don't want to completely choke the economy."
Works contracts, for example, for broad areas of craftsmanship, construction industry and plant construction are the basis for their value added to the customer.
“The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument.”
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
“When an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a security facility, it is a normal works contract.”
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It is unexplained why the portioning and packaging of cheese should be different from the labour law of sausage in the future, according to a statement on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
With a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many Eastern European employees from works contracting companies worked in the industry after the results of an examination by the NRW employment protection administration partly 16 hours a day.
They often had no break.
Pay was retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law for the meat industry had already entered into force in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
“It needs to be cleaned up fundamentally now.”
The politician announced: "The occupational safety law, which we intend to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that do not only concern the meat industry - for example, higher occupational safety check rates or clear criteria for community housing."
The draft DPA includes amendments to the Law on the Safeguarding of Workers’ Rights in the Meat Industry and to the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg’s Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I wish we could do even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example, animal transportation," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
More personnel are needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
In the crash of an ultralight aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel, in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people died, according to police reports.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people were injured in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel Circle said.
A parachute was found at the accident site, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a single or two-family house.
Further details were initially not known.
The evacuation of Frankfurter Opernplatz was peaceful
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opernplatz in the evening on Sunday has also proceeded peacefully.
Lastly, a few dozen people stayed on the square, but left him before the lock-out hour started at 1 o'clock.
The police had been in operation since the early evening with numerous officials, and a larger police order was seen throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, there was a ban on the opera place, where there had been clashes a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd of celebrators.
At least five officers were injured after police inputs, several police vehicles were damaged.
Saturday night was also quiet.
Car overfalls: Young woman seriously wounded in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 13.25 o’clock.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
With thermal cameras, the fire department sought possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was traveling on Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her residence Hümme, when her car dropped from the road for an unexplained cause and struck herself several times.
In order to save the accidented, the firefighters had to open the roof of the car.
As it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the ladder with a thermal camera.
The drone staff from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, the forces did not find anyone between the high corn plants.
The serious injured was taken by ambulance to the Kassel Clinic for further care.
Almost 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was shut down for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Championship in Italy
Turin - After a saving goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto of the club’s history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1:0 ahead of the mid-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which started without the last long-injured former national player Sami Khedira, is no longer moving from place one two game days before the end of the season of Serie A.
The Inter Milan score is seven points back.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met after a free kick variant with the last action.
A play by Miralem Pjanic recycled the 35-year-old directly from the penalty limit with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0 against the more offensive guests, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67th) was dusted.
This ensured the gloomless but decisive success.
The Foulelfmeter shot to the latte in the 89th minute probably only Ronaldo himself weighed correctly with a view to the goal-hunter score.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum is changing very slightly," coach Maurizio Sarri said after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, the Juve coach said.
Due to the defeat, the Turins had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve’s soothing lead at the top of the table was due, above all, to the weakness of its competitors.
In the eleven games before Sunday’s match, the Sarri team had only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo is still a goalkeeper is questionable.
For while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile after his triple pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona already has 34 goals on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bavaria.
The record is held in Italy by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title opportunity.
Juventus is in the eighth-finals of the Champions League, but on August 7, Olympique Lyon will have to make a 0-1 rear draw to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.O. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Despite all threatened penalties and court judgments, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and in the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
While there are no comparisons for the years before, the Rasers are doing more and more work with the judiciary: in the prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim in 2018, a total of 155 investigations for illegal races were conducted, a year later it was 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June it was 151.
The races were less about organized events, as the Ministry of the Interior responded to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers were either spontaneously opposed to each other or fled from the police – this is also indicated as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mostly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 penalties - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases the rasers are caught and also asked to check in: according to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonment sentences have been imposed.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually rising.
Instead, other drivers reacted more sensitively to the tragic accidents and trials of past years than they did before, a spokesperson for the ministry said.
The motorway 8 is particularly popular with razors and drivers are always braking traffic there to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught under teck near Kirchheim, and three months earlier, there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit, it is attempted to brake the razors on the particularly affected section between narrow and geising.
The mostly high-priced and luxury sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates because the drivers escape to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car racing in the neighboring country to lawn.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 km/h, we would create this problem on highways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD Landtags fraction.
"The inhibition threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you weren't supposed to be still legally on the way with 200 km/h and more."
From enlightenment or image campaigns, Rivoir thinks less: “Whoever overlooks all rules in such a way and puts at risk not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users, is hardly reachable with reason.”
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
“We assume that Raser will not be deterred from the speed limits,” says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also harsher controls on the affected routes.
It’s not uncommon to get painful and consequential: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country died in the races, two of them uninvolved in a night crash in Stuttgart’s downtown and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men were reported to have run a car race in November.
One of the vehicles dropped off the road, hit a garden wall and lying on the side of the 18-year-old passenger died.
Another 21 people were injured in the last two years’ races.
Though, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, harsher penalties are not necessary: “The need for law-giving action to impose harsher sanctions on illegal motor vehicle races is not seen,” the paper of the Ministry of the Interior says.

Further witnesses are received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory in final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann won his second day victory in the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfalzer from Team Bora-hansgrohe set out on the 109-kilometre-long stretch with start and finish in Hermannstadt in mass print after winning a stage already on Saturday.
It was the seasonal wins three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall score, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger took the lead.
The 26-year-old had sovereignly decided on the mountain ride in the morning and thus took the top in the ranking.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit during the mountain ride.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a victory," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” the 26-year-old said.
300 meters ahead of the goal, he simply drew his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the UCI World Association, a Corona test was performed on all racing participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire round trip, drivers and caregivers in isolated hygiene bubbles were separated from the organizational team as well as the media.
The spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
The board gave instructions for lay reanimation
Dusseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Dusseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) was suddenly in the water while bathing.
According to the fire brigade, the emergency call was received just before 1 p.m.
"A lead dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation," a firefighter spokesman told BILD.
The arrival rescue forces took on the revival measures shortly afterwards.
The endangered child was transported to the clinic under reanimation.
Why it happened is unclear.
Police have routinely started the investigation into the accident.
The firefighter said: "We are assuming a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorized Tuning Meeting - Police Attack, 700 Vehicles and Approximately 1100 People
Hundreds of cars and temporarily more than 1,000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night at the parking lot of a furniture shop.
The police implemented their announcement of intensifying control of such events.
A major tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police Mittelfranken, around 10:30 a.m., the Nuremberg Traffic Police found an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstädter Straße.
The police then carried out a variety of vehicle checks.
Only recently the police had announced that they wanted to intensify action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal Tuning Meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials were at the top of more than 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police report.
However, only a small part of the presence of the "autoposer" and tuning scene should be assigned to this.
Apparently most of the relevant scene followed the police appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it should be assumed that these were predominantly spectacular people.
In addition, the majority of those present remained in accordance with the existing infection protection regulations, in particular respecting the minimum distance and wearing a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on the ground were completed around 1:00 a.m.
All in all, officials noted such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the licence had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
“The Police Office of Mittelfranken will continue to keep an eye on what happens and will continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the arrival of spectaculars,” it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They have all beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this purpose.
Even because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause damage.
“Young people should finally get their cars back unharmed.”
Labour agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short work
Berlin - The Federal Labour Agency (BA) investigates about 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-term worker grants.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-term work," said Daniel Terzenbach, the board of directors responsible for the operational business, to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When many companies suddenly applied for short-term work at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, BA had to react quickly.
Usually the exam takes up to three weeks.
“So much time wasn’t available during this hot period.
The more closely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there's going to be a lot more.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Signs of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software uses to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
"Will there be much more insolvency than last year?
The assessments go apart, but we are preparing ourselves for the case and train our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money.”
The numbers are still unnoticed, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, some 40 teenagers held a party in the Neue Garten.
The collection was dissolved at 8:48 p.m. by the station drivers of the Foundation Prussian Castles and Gardens (SPSG), the foundation announced on request from PNN.
The young people would have left the park.
On Saturday evening, some teenagers played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by station drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There are often illegal celebrations in the parks.
In the parks of the Foundation there are accumulations that do not comply with the distance and hygiene rules of Covid-19.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, and a week later, about 150 people celebrated in the Neue Garten.
Even without a Corona regulation, the parks will be closed at darkness.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to the park rules, there are few exceptions.
The foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist town
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as state authorities in Linz reported.
There were more than 100 results in the evening.
Accordingly, many of the infected young interns are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourism officials were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The blocking time was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings there and there, said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Sometimes guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist town in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 nights last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections were made public.
The head of the District Authority, Alois Lanz, on Saturday defended the behaviour of the interns who had celebrated and may have been infected at several locations.
"We all enjoyed doing this in our youth," he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association has launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang as of July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak awakens memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which in the early stages of the pandemic was a center of coronavirus spread throughout Europe.
In total, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
Focus on new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured the third place on the last day of the Premier League match with a 2:0 (0:0) success against the direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to satisfy themselves with the Europa League because FC Chelsea was still passing and also qualified as fourth for the royal class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to rejoice.
Manchester United went in lead by a penalty kick by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the aftermath, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) finished.
Chelsea, an opponent of FC Bayern in the Champions League finals, won Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) parallel to 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as a Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win against Wolverhampton also benefited from Tottenham Hotspur, which still passed the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the duel for itself with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84) matched Andrej Jarmolenko (85) immediately.
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost to Arsenal with 2:3 (1:3).
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, declines after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, a point was missing.
FC Liverpool, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest value the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team just missed the point record in English football.
The top score holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After leading Newcastle in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
“For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season,” goalkeeper van Dijk said after the game, “that should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League boss will be happy.
Due to the Coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from March 13 to June 17.
Meanwhile, even a premature discontinuation or playing of the rest of the games on neutral ground was discussed.
After all, the season could be played without special events – but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrestation and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
In the night there were violent disputes.
Israeli police acted violently in Jerusalem on Sunday night against participants in a demonstration against left-wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for participation in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water launchers to dissolve the demonstration.
A total of about 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu’s headquarters, according to media reports on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s dealing with the Corona crisis.
The protesters hit drums, blew in horns, and called for Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site “ynet” reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head’s private villa in the coastal town of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested, according to police reports, near Tel Aviv for suspicion of spraying pepper from a driving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption process against the leader.
Netanyahu was also criticized for handling the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is prepared for a second wave of coronavirus.
The Corona crisis has severely affected the economy of the country.
The unemployment rate last was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to record-breaking levels.
Accident in Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A car accident on Saturday afternoon called for nine minor injuries on the B58 near Ahlen.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police said: "She probably suddenly braked because she wanted to turn around."
This must have been seen by the driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her, probably too late.
He crashed on the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea decreases border city after suspected coronavirus
North Korea has previously seen its own measures to fight against the coronavirus as “a bright success.”
The country has reported a suspected case for the first time.
Due to a first official coronavirus suspect in the country, North Korea has completely sealed a large city out of fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, “the malicious virus could have been introduced into the country,” state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, emergency has been imposed.
The Communist leadership called the highest level of alarm.
Should the case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the secluded country.
North Korea has not registered a single infection so far and has described its defense measures as a “light success.”
The information was doubted abroad.
Symptoms of the disease were reported to have been detected in an “escaper” who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South Korea and North Korea on July 19.
The person retired to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation of the crossing of the border within the four kilometers wide and largely still mined military buffer zone from South Korea.
South Korea’s military, however, acknowledged the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
Investigations were carried out on some people.
North Korea, according to its own data, on Saturday called for an emergency meeting of the Workers’ Party’s Political Office under the chairmanship of President Kim Jong Un.
The dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster.
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to “completely block Kaesong and isolate every district and the region from others.”
The person concerned and all those in Kaesong who had contact with him were put in quarantine.
Accordingly, the party’s central military commission will investigate the “evictions” and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose a severe punishment.
An estimated 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are yet to be discussed
"In addition to environmental topics, the committee members will also vote on the construction plan for the larger city development project-East," it is said more casually in the middle part of the urban press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4:30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Especially the upgrade of the eastern city, however, is controversial until the end.
The majorities are scarce, most recently in individual committees, depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, commerce and IT) that project developed out of citizenship and then by administration and municipal council now does not fail after nearly ten years of preparation, project opponent Reinhard Klein criticized as "outside parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "delusion" and "conscious falsehoods".
"Everyone thinks they know it better," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim citizenship list for a year.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit of the city will be cheaper, the Technical Town Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than predicted in the town hall and on the part of the proponents of the economy.
To shape the city by its own power and not an investor: this was his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also includes the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schlossberg, the rental of the Ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller part of downtown redesign ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
The municipal council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noises caused by road traffic, many of which include temporary reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent that this should happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
Furthermore, the agenda for accession to the Land Baden-Württemberg climate pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban day care facilities and the application for inclusion in the federal smart-city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to pay attention to Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the Supersports League could start regular operations, the first test rides were now in place.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first service trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different than the Porsche from the pre-season,” Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really was a lot of fun.”
He also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” said Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have made enormous progress on the Lausitzring from session to session."
The GT Masters will also run its first race right there – at the Lausitzring.
As of July 31, the 33 super sports cars will be racing through the Lausitz.
But Zimmermann, who is one of 15 Serienneulingen, knows the route.
In 2015 he was last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get little used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitz ring has many fast passages that you have to make optimally to be fast."
How fast the carpenter is then, it turns out in two weeks.
“Of course, the teams poker a little bit in the tests,” he says.
Finally, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at Lausitzring.
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly pressed calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
Currently, no spectators will be admitted - but there is a prominent guest.
Former Formula 1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will join the GT steering wheel in mid-August on the Nürburgring.
British Transport Minister Cold-Catched in Quarantine Decision
The British government’s decision to put Spain holidaymakers in quarantine for two weeks after their return has cold-catched the country’s transport minister, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Due to the rising numbers of coronaviruses in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also have to be in quarantine after he returns.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on vacation date, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain is considered to be one of the “safe” countries for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"A number of ministers must have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on vacationers in Spain," Labour MP Diane Abbot said.
“But apparently no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapp.”
Almost a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict outlet barrier, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists blame the nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favorite vacation countries of the British.
Unnecessary travel to the mainland of Spain is currently recommended by the British government, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers are excluded.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus have been registered in Spain and more than 28,000 dead.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Navy Day in his country that the warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersound weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian Navy would be expanded, Putin said Sunday at the central naval parade in St. Petersburg.
The Ministry of Defense also informed the agency Interfax of successful tests of the Zirkon Hypersonic Missile built for the Navy.
Hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropeo continues to be built
It is also built on the nuclearly fitted underwater torpedo Poseidon, it said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also sailed on a military boat himself, said that 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world this year alone.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been protecting Russia reliably, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors across the country.
In many other Russian coastal locations, the Navy’s Day was also organized with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside leader Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
Not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets were seen in a video released by the Ministry of Defense.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help is complicated because of Corona
WASHINGTON - The first hurricane of this season over the Atlantic landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, heavy winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center told the U.S. Climate Authority NOAA on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott proclaimed emergency status for numerous districts.
The Texas-based corona pandemic is making the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott said, according to U.S. media.
Evacuates call for caution
“Every hurricane is an enormous challenge,” Abbott said in the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Looking at the Texas hurricane, he added: "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated considering it is swept by an area that is the state's worst affected by Covid-19."
According to the Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices that we have become accustomed to, such as wearing masks, the governor told CBS.
It is important that everyone keeps a distance.
In some places hotel rooms have also been provided.
In addition, they will be tested for Corona in emergency accommodations.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
At wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, according to officials, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been ranked as the lowest-level hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had initially been issued and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a decline as "Hanna" continued to move into the country and headed towards the northeast of Mexico.
Douglas is moving to Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurricane "Douglas" was traveling towards Hawaii at night on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the Hurricane Center expected it to weaken further.
It is forecast to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday, then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic this year, NOAA anticipated an over-averagely active hurricane season following a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the authority said.
On average, there are six hurricanes a year over the Atlantic, three of which are developing into storms of great strength.
Given the climate data available and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, compared to a below-average one just 10 percent.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.

Sassuolos Filip Djuricic was awarded two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals scored: Sassuolo Calcio saw a black raving evening at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A at 0:2 (0:1) - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick recovered "to a certain extent well" after the first team training, he must consider how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who, behind Captain Manuel Neuer and midfield leader Joshua Kimmich, has the third-most operation minutes, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to miss in decisive royal-class duels.
In Munich Schmuddelwetter, the right defender broke off a training game and was driven off the field with a golf map.
How long the unrestricted regular player must pause in the battle for the title is open.
A bet in the eighth-final back match against Chelsea on August 8 is likely to be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
Bavaria does not want to be stopped by the misfortune of the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on his way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are expected to show his victory-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the royal-class final on August 23.
"We have performed the mandatory tasks with championship and cup simply excellently.
Now it is necessary to create the special thing," Flick said.
Until Munich can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve in concrete terms, the eighth-final duty against FC Chelsea is at hand for the first time.
After the 3:0 game before the Corona break, the Londoners should not be the Bavaria nightmare in the home arena like in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and fill trust with a good game,” Flick said.
A match test will be held against Olympique Marseille on Friday.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, on a unique August.
He greeted 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players for the noble purchase Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after he moved from Manchester City.
"Leroy has been well inserted like all new ones," Flick said.
However, instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to only train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small-group training, team strength is now trained for the Londoners, who are in playing rhythm unlike the flick ensemble.
After that, Munich could have a quarterfinal against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite that easy," stressed the chief coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup goalkeeper Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparation, which is especially important in the 0-to-100 match.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive characteristic of his team.
The tournament with nine teams on Sunday was also ambitious.
All of the performers were there, including the willing Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the royal-class season is not secured.
Formula One needs a special rule to win its World Champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All American races have been cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
To the ten confirmed Grand Prix, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring will be driven in Germany and the Portuguese Portimão.
On November 1, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for World Cup points on the Italian Traditional Race Track in Imola.
Thus, the 2020 race calendar includes 13 runs according to current state.
“We are delighted that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the royal class of motorsport will be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 will finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is expected to be fixed and released in the coming weeks.
Ahead of the race already officially launched in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports said appearances could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require racing on three continents
However, the regulations of Formula 1 require at least racing on three continents for the award of the World Cup.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driving, there is supposed to be a world champion.
By means of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the title with reference to "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled short-term due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a matter.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation of criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil.
“We look forward to being with them again next season,” Carey said.
The rejection of the Americas race was critical, especially in Brazil: "The rejection came not surprisingly for us, but the reasons we can't accept," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a rejection.
We are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil gaze against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert’s well-known Latenight show on video and revealed in an interview what she had in her mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate kivist Greta Thunberg was a video show guest in a popular US latenight show.
Among other things, she talked about her struggle against the mighty of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad eye" in her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention with her tireless commitment to the “Fridays For Future” movement.
She now spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans for the future and her encounter with U.S. President Donald Trump at last year’s UN climate summit.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg in your show on Tuesday and gave a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She talked not only about her struggle against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powers.
“There are a few things that surprised me,” she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
“Everything from organized hatred campaigns to threats just because a group of children goes out on the streets,” she said.
Heads of state and leaders who mock her on social media or even try to silence her find her "fun" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer to it."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she turned a bitterly bitter eye to U.S. President Trump afterwards.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the Aktvist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive eye was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip came a GIF, i.e. an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at the moment?
To Stephen Colbert’s relatively open question, she answered briefly and dryly: “To be honest, I think that doesn’t need any further explanation.”
The experienced satirician Colbert had probably not expected the answer and disappeared briefly laughing out of the picture.
With her speech "How dare you?" on the principles of climate protection, she kept many remembered at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Real Estate with Triple Pack for Lazio Rome

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The band's co-founder Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the legendary band in 1967 in London, until today his dreamed instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") looked like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their biggest successes but then without him.
There was a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the group’s winnings for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems have also played a role.
Three years after the band was founded, Green left the band in 1970.
There followed a social decline.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, according to biographers.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the surface.
He is said to have lived on the street for a while as a cemetery gardener and spent a time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
At a young age, he became passionate about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play guitar professionally and five years later, he was given the chance to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the lead of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green failed to cope with the media rumble, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
By the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac was swimming on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not succeed in a major comeback until he re-started in 1996 with a group of friends of musicians.
The British Daily Telegraph at the time spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound, one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
