Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday in Gutach, the new B 33 pedestrian railway station at the village parking lot - in the vicinity of the older city lights.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or shielding?
This question was answered clearly by the mayor of Gutach yesterday.
"The city lighthouse was installed at the time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser lights ensure safe cyclists as well as bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The facility, which was officially commissioned yesterday, is important for the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the traffic flow from the residential area 'Grub'.
"For the high traffic and pedestrian population, another light had to be made for their safety," says Eckert.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Land Council Office.
“According to current measurements, approximately 12,000 vehicles travel through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B33, of which about 10 percent are heavy-duty traffic,” Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another beacon is more than necessary: “Security is just going on here,” Arnold said.
A total of four traffic shows had been conducted, a roundabout was also considered, but rejected again because of the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was tested in the selection of the spotlight posts before: "Amid an extra van loaded with particularly long wooden rods for us, we tested whether these vehicles can leave the Sulzbachweg onto the B 33 without turning the spotlight post over".
Arnold explained that the 15,000-euro lighting system itself is "the most modern thing on the market today."
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs, which shine so brightly that the lights are easily recognizable by drivers, for example, even in the deep sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones only eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, it comes green immediately for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
“If a group or people with disabilities go over the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone can safely get over the road,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver must think here as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the lights for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle roared through - with bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has written about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the inclination to raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - has been described many times by the Kärntner poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose writer, theatre lyrics are rare in his work.
Gerhard Fresacher for his performance "Weather lights on the tongue tip", which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore compiles a collage of prose texts.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Slaveigene" (1987) with prosaminiaturs from "Leichnam, seine Familie beschauend" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important requisit: a crushed sofa, on which it is supposedly copulated and masturbated - the eight-person ensemble is hanging through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the template with an abundance of directing incidents, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms.
Especially the actresses come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are harshly touched, dipped with their head under water, with their evening robes to the wall.
Engaged in cellophane or mid, they stack on dangerously high sticks through the stage, either monologize loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly transmitted in this extensive manner.
The best moments the evening has when it is sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk song.
Only towards the end comes the overwhelming performance to some rest, and Winkler’s straight after absurd humor flashes.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that finds place in the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record every kilometre traveled and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups, calling for the government to use the small boxes to record the kilometres traveled – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax decisions.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
However, while one cannot agree in Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently considering how to switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’ll only potentially use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles traveled among all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 onwards.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, funded from the taxes paid by Americans at the gasoline, is bankrupt.
In America, however, there is no longer as much fuel as it used to be.
Cars consume less fuel.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per litre) has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent at high fuel prices.
“The fuel tax is simply not sustainable,” says Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most long-term alternative,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that traffic jams and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The Californian planners rely on the system in developing strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally established climate change goals.
But Pennsylvania’s Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most feasible long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation’s free marketers are also inspired by the idea of getting riders to pay for the journey.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Reason’s Vice President of Policies.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
Last year, the Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move, responding to the concerns of deputies from rural areas representing people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities are nevertheless moving on their own in this direction.
The most dedicated is Oregon, which currently hires 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mile fees instead of the oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers have recently been equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical about the idea that the government could track any of their movements.
“Consciousness about Big Brother and things like that was a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Earnings Management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the kilometres traveled, but not exactly when and where.
So, Khan said, the public would also be more calm.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not originally start to assist states in taxing motorists.
Instead, their goal was to set foot in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers should pay based on the miles driven.
But the devices it tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more likely to get involved if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners experiment with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles travelled by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other organizations hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation, which can also be used to pay parking fees, insurance only needs to be paid for kilometres traveled, and speed data collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system,” the city said in a planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
Officials told the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or annual fee could be imposed on drivers using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Small team strikes stronger
The Volunteer Firefighters handled their autumn main sample with bravery despite personnel shortages.
Only 11 men participated in the exercise.
Division Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in Burgberger Straße in his practice assumption.
There, a short circuit was created during sawing.
The resulting fire and smoke development injured two people, but one of them could still send an emergency call.
After the first inspection by Hans Kammerer, two air protectors of the Wehr prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, we managed to find the first person and take them out.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
Furthermore, there were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first deletion attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was conducted via an overflow hydrant at about 100 meters away.
Three deletion attacks have now been made.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
During the exercise, Hans Kammerer also pointed out what can be done with little staff available.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided through the Königsfeld Day Service Group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workforce of tomorrow came from.
At the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald, he investigated this important issue together with the executive directors of the vocational schools and the district gymnasium and the chairpersons of the parental advisory board.
"Education is an important site factor," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who introduced the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the district gymnasium and the professional school centre in the forest city.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
“It is important not only to take into account the family phase, but also the phase around care for relatives due to demographic changes,” Wolf said.
He also stated that more and more employees are taking care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned about the benefits of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, are often preserved by the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the Landtag President showed himself convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the skilled workforce needs could also be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in southwestern Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced on his rail journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
“Continue to be persistent and make sure public transport improves,” he told the local politicians.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years already, the Kaul family has invited the Dieting seniors to coffee, cake and then to a vesper.
Previously, the older fellow citizens were hosted at the resting place.
This afternoon takes place at the nursing home of St. Joseph.
The inhabitants looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old school courtyard standing before the renovation to the church street will again be placed on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the kibbing, a small angle wall was installed in the first works of the renovation of the front school courtyard, for stabilization and static relief of the more than a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further step is to include the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Then a cost calculation will be made by professionals, which will then be put on the table to the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary to restore from scratch the walls that need to be renovated and placed on a new underground in the foreseeable future.
The historic, one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old school courtyard to the church street, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, requires renovation and has an inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A secure wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use school courtyard, which has been done by the current attachment work.
Initially, the school court renovation was planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
An important word in the historic school wall renovation, which has already been used for film shootings, will be addressed by the State Monument Office.
Should specifications come from this page, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument guardians.
Students of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now taught again in a well-renovated old school building with new classrooms, will soon be able to use the old school courtyard.
Özdemir wants jazz training in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has also participated.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," Özdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music are at the Stuttgart jazz site.
Thus, Özdemir, who is considered a favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the Bundestag elections on 22 September, contradicts the Green Red Landesregierung.
Based on an expert study, it is forcing a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the Jazz and Pop programme will be moved from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim, among others.
U.S. border: "Super tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
On the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US customs authorities reported, the more than 500 meters long pipe between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
The tunnel has not yet been used.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves under the radar,” U.S. Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a press conference in front of a San Diego warehouse where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Duffy said, “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The railway system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the seized marijuana.
All three are threatened as the highest penalty of life imprisonment, officials said.
Eight tunnels of this type have been discovered since 2006, the San Diego press conference said.
This is the first time that cocaine has been found in a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug search in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the United States.
There were no details about the arrested, at least one was a Mexican, it said.
You have to expect prison sentences of up to 10 years.
2014 becomes Geisinger Festivitätsjahr
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250s.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary year is coming.
Geisingen and church houses were first documentally mentioned together in 794.
A document was made in churches that mentioned both places.
On March 15, there will be an official opening for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event takes place in the place, where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be celebrated in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Return celebration.
On Friday with a celebration, on Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the Church Hall.
This weekend is also the Church-Hauser Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is performed at three appointments.
On June 21, together with the Sunnwendfeier der Schwarzwaldverein, on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated during the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on September 27th and 28th.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle will also be released.
“But it should be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on the geising of today, which consists of Geisingen, church-houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen,” says Mayor Walter Henggster.
And also today's geising celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 today's space was completed with the municipalities.
The new chronicle will then be presented on November 21 or 22 in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversary.
The Narrenunft Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen turns 90 years and holds the festive banquet on March 29th and then celebrates the District Music Festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the well festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned documentally in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was then court place.
Both municipalities are mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate this 1250th anniversary accordingly in 2014, in addition to the municipal reform is 40 years ago.
Council targets railway installations
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be extensively rebuilt to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros in hand for this.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety of railway crossings is to be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains across the country with other vehicles.
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they must participate in the costs with one third, the rest of the railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bah transition "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build a dock at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
There, larger vehicles, for example those carrying longwood, could also be able to stand in counter traffic without having to block the railways.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could broaden the subsequent road at due time in order to ensure smooth traffic flow.
This was controversial in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for street spread: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, brought the mood of critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas said the railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles who are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
In view of the fact that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and renovated, as is the case currently in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned expansion of the road.
Nevertheless, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing with the provision that the necessary support wall should be constructed in such a way that the town could expand the subsequent road in the direction of "Railway Stationstraße", if necessary, to about 5.5 meters for encounter traffic.
On the other hand, the transformation of the railway crossing at the Trautwein gerbery could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns access to the highly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had asked the engineering office Breinlinger to examine the plans for the conversion of the railway, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would then be possible without further doubt.
The investigation concluded that it cannot be excluded that the inclination of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit.
The responsibility for this again bears the city as a road construction load carrier.
The change could lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the turning functioned in the current development state, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
Also at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than on the other railway crossings, because directly next to the stop point center, to which a good visual connection exists.
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be slowed at this point so much that no collision would be threatened.
A majority of the conversion of this railway crossing was refused, as the city of Schiltach would "have to eliminate the problem of mounting vehicles," according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction works.
It is unproblematic that the panel considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been made.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes – experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects to launch in the coming years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Distant worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already been discovered by astronomers.
Whether there are lives on at least some of them, no one knows.
Selection is difficult: Should we look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering alien life?
These questions are just asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their program "Cosmic Vision", they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that aim to decisively advance research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were discussed, five of which have now come to a closer election.
Numerous bodies reviewed the proposals, followed by the researchers.
In the coming days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Program Committee.
In total, Esa has chosen four major questions, to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision program, initiated in 2007, are to be answered.
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds – and thus also the formation of planets that orbit these stars – are still in proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To address this question, in 2017, the space telescope "Cheops" will launch, which will explore 500 already known planetary systems in our surroundings.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
Using larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be indicative of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to ultimately provide an insight into the prerequisites for the emergence of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined exemplarily.
With the "Solar Orbiter", Esa has already approved a M-Class mission (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is expected to launch in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, Esa plans to be the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and explores the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the laws of nature that we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united.
How was the universe created and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy which accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are made of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved a M mission here, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, thus allowing conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
Many experts believe that the best chances of getting an L-Mission approval are "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do it, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission includes a two- or three-sonde detector to be stationed in space.
In contrast to plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that emerged during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four more proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena" to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", the Earth.
Among other things, proposals for sample transport from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, and for solar physics, have already been excreted.
Snowden willing to “cooperate” with Germany in terms of U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence agency, has declared he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which Ströbele presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he writes: “Even if the outcome of my efforts has been proven positive, my government continues to treat a diverging opinion as a breach of loyalty and attempts to criminalize political opinion with a threat of punishment in which no defence is possible.”
To say the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that support from the international community could convince the US government to drop the charges against him.
The charge raised by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to enable that.”
The U.S.-German relations are heated by claims that the NSA listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, MEP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence, said that one should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if possible, “without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele said that, according to former NSA employee Snowden’s lawyer, he would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden said in his letter that he was facing a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that expelled him from his homeland.
However, he is touched by the global reaction to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the disclosures of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden made an offer to the German authorities of cooperation, “when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been solved.”
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to claim up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if the announcement was read on Wednesday that passengers are allowed to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it would be $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travellers who only paid at the bridge.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee aims to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate this sum,” she said.
In 2008, airlines began charging for the first and second checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to avoid this have thus stuck as much as possible in hand luggage, resulting in the luggage compartments over the seat being often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It’s about Frontier’s most loyal customers, who have clearly expressed that it is becoming more and more difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry one piece of luggage free of charge at the frontier hallway, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O’Malley said Frontier’s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrived at the hallway.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee will only come into effect in the summer, but there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often reproach baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to rely on them.
They argue that the transport of luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wished.
Many on Wall Street see the new luggage fees as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
However, most have left their fingers on charges for hand luggage so far.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost aircraft.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said Airline Advisor Jay Sorensen, who carefully monitors the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand luggage fee brings $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who formerly held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious what he would expect at the hallway if passengers faced the company’s unusual hand luggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve ever experienced in my aviation career,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth-crimping and hand-tapping discussions at the boardwalk.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding went like lubricated.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for the $2 required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice are allowed to keep the entire can and refill coffee for free.
Water is still free.
In 2008, US Airways tried to ask for money for refreshments, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company followed.
Frontiers’ step to collect charges for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them rather than via an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, when booking via an online travel agency, the company started awarding only half as many frequent travel miles.
On Wednesday, the miles were again cut to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight booked with a third party with Frontier over 1,000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively for direct purchase on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
Revenue decreased by 9 percent and flight capacity decreased by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report released Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to control the finances of Frontier in the context of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
More than 40 women attended this year’s last women’s breakfast in the evangelical church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish house was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Redemptions from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, addressed the biblical proverbs after breakfast.
“Words contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings,” she said.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as, “Tree eyes be vigilant, like scales fall from their eyes, and look at someone whom the Lord gives in sleep, and wash his hands in innocence.”
A number of times the speaker also told her listeners what the proverb was.
The Church Minority Christel Dehner adopted the phrases from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, to make blue, to hide something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases, which she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a tombola was drawn.
The prizes lay covered on a table and were humorously written before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also the Mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unlearned tourism
At the Mecklenburg Lake Plate, they are launching a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unlearned in the industry will be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with grades," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA says an "internal mistake" and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake shut down its public website for several hours and not hackers as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an email message.
The problem will be resolved that evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is not true.
Early in the evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and is still unavailable for some users.
A spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and attacks are not intended to penetrate the target system’s internal network.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No such agency), is now in the bright light of the public and is exposed to sharp criticism in the past few months after the revelations made known about its extensive monitoring program in the country and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data released by the disillusioned former NSA.
The growing controversy about the intelligence service sparked initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber surgery.
The number of unemployed fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
While the quota is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy office manager of the Labour Agency in Sonthofen.
Many companies have so far reacted to settings.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: “We have hardly any professionals in the crafts, healthcare and elderly care.”
As a result of the season, job offers for staff in the hotel and catering industry have been opening again since September.
The winter season begins here in mid-December.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profit for Bombardier after decrease in delivery and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after being pressured by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter as well as contractual problems in the railway division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information as to whether the aircraft could go into commercial use according to the ambitious schedule next September.
On the test plane's virgin flight one and a half months ago, only three more takeoffs were followed, making it seemingly questionable whether the test phase was as planned.
Results remained behind forecasts, leading to a price drop of over eight percent on the Toronto stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his valuation from "outperform" to "sector perform" in view of the stock having a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
“While weaker delivery figures for aircraft were expected to be as far as possible, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft series will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries are moderate at 177, as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and potential cost savings of the new jet aircraft are correct.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
The corporate management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule.
“The test aircraft has not remained on the ground any longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft’s lifetime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then add a revision period, which we have also done.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical about whether, twelve months after the virgin flight, the first customer can put a CSeries plane into operation.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progression of the flight test – even though it obviously corresponds to Bombardier’s internal planning – strengthens our view that the commissioning is postponing to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share of $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Sales declined slightly and declined from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
Net orders dropped from 83 aircraft to 26.
The orders in the aerospace department were $32.9 billion on September 30, and thus remained unchanged compared to December 31.
“In the aerospace sector, the results were within the scope of our requirements, but the low order intake and the overall market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this division have increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
On September 30, the orders in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion, which was slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by resolution problems in some major contracts.
According to company management, new requirements will be set for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share dropped by 8.5 percent, at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Pichette will change to the board of directors.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bomber’s closest rival, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown shot at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management reported on Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security officer was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
U.S. President Barack Obama is being informed on an ongoing basis of the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3, eyewitnesses reported to have seen a shooter with a rifle in one of the departure halls, several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people were looking for protection in panic.
Travellers had screamed and children had cryed.
Among the waiters, panic broke out, many had hid behind chairs for fear.
He has heard two shots, a traveler says in the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security agency suffered a shooting injury at the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
Afterwards, he was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots fell near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television pictures, numerous sick and police cars were driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a special operation command and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport line said via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in long backwards.
Until landings, air traffic was temporarily discontinued, it said.
However, several aircraft were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, shared information with underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking investigation after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The “first-class” lawyer, nicknamed “Bash” by criminalists, was arrested in his house in 2011 after police supervised Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug proceeding.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal in the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards during tests.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds in cash during a series of home searches.
Ditta, 42, shared information with the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two indictments for impediment to the judiciary.
He admitted ownership of cocaine in a previous survey.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out in their investigation into Scarborough that he had regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta’s house and put the drugs in a black golf glove under the attorney’s trash bin with a purity of 60 percent.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta, who was on dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It was announced in court that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after class A drugs were discovered in his hair, his wallet and on his credit cards during tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine, saying he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claiming that their discussion was subject to the “secret of lawyer.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said he was running an office at both his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal affairs.
It was announced in court that he had called for important drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “A criminal attorney should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defense attorney because he has been too much involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these individuals.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus dishonested his profession.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said: “Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defenseman to a criminal at the moment he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence.
Ditta has deceived this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation of Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and impairment of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trading.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta posted a section with questions and answers about himself, claiming that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at the dinner is Mohammed Ali, and inequality of opportunities is the motivation for his work.
The Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of his 160th anniversary, the Liedkranz Dunningen will frame two worship services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
Following the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which excited the audiences this spring, the song crown will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Messe by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary mass will be heard from 19 onwards during the evening mass at St. Martin’s Church Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10:15 a.m. at the divine service at St. John’s Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Chants to celebrate the sacred sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its emergence.
The Mass is listed as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the blower group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Scepticism is leaving confidence
With the 2015 parish council elections, for example, the pastoral unit Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because there is nothing to change in the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish municipalities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism of the new is hesitant but increasingly confident.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the chief officers of the pastoral team ranged.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt presented the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
Afterwards, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a public law body that enters into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parishioner will be represented.
At least two elected members of each parish shall be represented, and the six parishes shall form local community teams.
Their task in the future will be to promote the church’s life in the town.
The question of the finances of each parish community then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that the accumulated funds in the parishes will be preserved for purposes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, go to the entire community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment all parishes will then meet, there were great concerns.
"In the past, too, only projects have been invested in which individual parishes could handle alone," said Haslach's parish municipality chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbarian Knight, the chairman of the body in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made the task of "Becoming One, Stay Five" in 2006 and had to realize that it wasn't that easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslach pastoral unit then set out to answer the questions regarding the future composition and size of the parish council, as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concretized in further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish municipality Michael Schöner of Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed in front of the SÜDKURIER, a four-person Pfullendorfer family has an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5,277 cents to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This fee is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major electricity routes.
These calculate the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can charge by a surcharge above the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf forms the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the supervisory board of the energy company even anticipated a higher surcharge, as Jörg-Arne Bias reported.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the Stadtwerke could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, with the number being closer to 2 cents.
Light on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a light doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not respond, or the light signal is defective.
What to do - driving in red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the journal "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "adequate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to persist for at least five minutes before you can assume that the lights are dysfunctional.
However, those who continue the journey despite red lights must be aware that they are fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Those who are tolerating themselves less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Upper Land Court Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to be responsible for a negligent red light breach.
The light was not faulty, but jumped onto green a little later.
A driving ban was spared because of the special situation, but the fine was not.
City Council is pleased to have a solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipality in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debt since 2005.
In this sense, the financial year 2012 can also be accounted for as a complete success.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around €7.6 million over €1 million was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around one million euros above the approach, at around 1.8 million euros.
The surplus is due primarily to higher trade tax revenues and the share of the municipality’s income tax.
The asset budget was also significantly higher than the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher input from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investments were made in the financial year 2012 than planned, the inflow of reserves has also been higher.
Overall, the overall reserve was increased by around €2.1 million to a total of €4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and his team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like this out of the sleeve," praised Gerster looking at the annual accounts.
He and the municipal council were very pleased with the good figures.
It may sound paradoxical, but precisely these good figures could soon cost citizens expensive.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to avoid high lifting rates in the past.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country have already been cut.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various compensation levels.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
“We need to look at the issue of lifting, as in the coming years there are investments that we would like to have grants for,” said Gerster.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s story at the men’s song club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the herbs festival, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men’s songclub.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir that has been won more than lovely.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and faithfulness he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral referee on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues handed him the German choir association's certificate and a gravured tin plate.
In addition to the honour, the 31st Autumn Festival took place in the usual ways: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the Singer Division Baisingen and the local music club, the full mariners had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and vocal styles, which entertained the around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmarigen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Wine Paradise" and "Lustig, ihr Brothers".
For his honorable singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
Betra also sang classic choral songs such as "Jägerwerbung" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When du passest through the valley".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "impuls choir" - ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir abducted in foreign countries with the Napolitan popularity "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, while the "impuls choir" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The song division of the Baisinger Sportverein came with "What isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlieder" back to the native fields, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical finish.
For the kids there was a small secondary program - "Grandmother Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperl theatre and read a few stories that the kids were busy about lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and daycare centres in the Zollernalbkreis receive post these days.
The Schwarzwald Messenger, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, wants to assist the facilities in the realization of their construction and embellishment wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and kindergartens from the entire Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or embellishment wish for your facility, you can apply with it to the Black Forest Messenger.
Be creative with your kids and surprise the jury of the Action Kindergarten Building Site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwald Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be to be realized with building materials worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on one (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to take care of many laborious construction workers.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press upset controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one can ask oneself: what does Parliament prevent from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” was read in the newspaper, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government is "effectively taking the media into an ashock" by the new law, while The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya would have "suffered a serious blow" and called the draft "draconic".
The passing of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate mall in September.
The Kenyan media attracted anger from the authorities because they released shots of security cameras on which the units sent to the scene allegedly robbed the luxurious mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded with the request of two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even though the call was withdrawn after a media outcry.
According to the new law, media houses can be fined with up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possessions of the person concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “even a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
Furthermore, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on the description of Kenya's "living blogosphere".
If they silence the media, politicians could do unpunished whatever they want.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians yourself, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors,” he said.
The Kenyan legislators have already raised public trouble in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the reductions ordered by the National Compensation Commission and re-enacted their low salaries of about 532,000 shilling tax-free per month – among the world’s highest.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for the FC
In spite of the cold weather and the rain, the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports ground did not lose any attention to the importance of the city and the football club.
Last Saturday everyone would have wanted a more pleasant celebration, but Peter did not want to participate.
Thus all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold such one for any reason.
This went to the musicians who framed the celebration, just like many other speakers.
Nass was therefore also the FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were first and foremost Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the association members who participated.
Lothar Hero, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The armed retirees placed 400 square meters of paving stones for the new ways.
This remarkable volunteer commitment was also acknowledged by Landtag Member Karl Rombach.
Further words of greeting were spoken for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the Southern Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that constantly recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn placed the original lawnplace in such a way that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when it was thought of the construction of a third place on the grounds of the football club or at the real school at Lake Salinen.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up about creating an artificial lawn sports ground, which was generally seen as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were started two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in heritage, pledged a cost contribution of €100,000 for the construction of the square and approved the country funding of €104,000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros on the total cost of 560,000 euros, summed up Klumpp.
The construction of the 68-foot 108-foot artificial grass square was started on June 4.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic meters of land were removed, half of which was used to set up a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of internal affairs and justice.
The relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, deputies and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
This should include the issue of double citizenship, in which both sides have opposite ideas.
The SPD wants to end the force for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the issue of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD emphasized its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for multiple driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," said SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was threatened evasion traffic on country roads, which are already the main points of accident.
The introduction of a toll for all passenger cars would also be a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
“There is a risk that the compensation for Germans will be removed at a later date,” he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When is it going to be summer again?" wasn't actually the question on Friday night at the open air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.

Severely injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old girl from Müsch was traveling with her car on the Kempener Außenring towards Grefrath at around 21.15 a.m.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Street, she saw the 37-year-old’s car coming to meet.
The carriage collided.
The Aachener suffered severe injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Lockdown after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
The accident occurred, according to police, when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., drove out of town on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left-wing lane towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
This collided with the BMW of a 23-year-old Constanzer driving there.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old behind the BMW.
A total of about 15,000 casualties were caused, police said.
The road had to be locked during the accident recording, it said.
Vienna airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future, there will be no longer such announcements at Vienna-Schwechat airport.
Most of the loudspeakers are dropped away with it - the noise level is to be lowered so significantly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of announcements concerning individuals.
The airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai, among others, are already refraining from the noisy calls.
The elimination of these promises – on average, around 200 personal calls from the speakers in one day – is meant to be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual messages were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all the other information about changed boarding trips or departure times here also goes down a bit," said Kleemann in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car drawing with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural Autumn Festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander games will start at 1:30 p.m.
Though they have a Scottish tradition, they are Swabian at the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of throwing trees, throwing horseshoes and carrying water buckets.
Four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms weighing.
“It doesn’t matter to the wide,” explains organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be thrown off vertically, overwhelmed once and then just come to lying down.
This is evaluated with most points.
When you throw a horseshoe, it depends on the precision of the target.
From eight meters away, it is thrown on a pitch.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying a water bucket above 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a pond are measured at the end.
Two of each "clan" or team are allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
It can be trained from 10 a.m.
Suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the Scotland skirt.
Swabian clothing is also allowed.
For the outfit, the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening the music friends come at their own expense.
At 7 p.m., the Biraboemian Blasmusik from Schömberg celebrates the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays a fleet of polkas and marches.
But their repertoire also includes feeling waltz and a rich big-band sound.
With it will be Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron, for some time among the canals.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the Narrenunft.
On Sunday, the music association Leinstetten entertains for the morning, from 2 p.m. the peasant chapel Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the celebration end.
The stoppage party with DJ Ralf is already open on Friday.
Additional program points are Saturday and Sunday, among other things, the Oldtimer and Tracker Meeting, exhibitions of companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday include the maize labyrinth, the craftsman’s market and the sheepsharing.
Specially for children there is a pet zoo, straw jumping castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the funding association Multipurpose Halle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkapsel".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pureed tofu with vegetable cream, for example, is a quarker replacement.
Furthermore, the Vegetarian Federation calls for World Vegan Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt is replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oatmeal, almond or rice milk could be used.
Traditional beat cream can be replaced.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple mushroom or one tablespoon ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loose dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people are currently eating vegan, i.e. purely herbal, in Germany.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American Greater City of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we headed to the Brooklyn Bridge, where on foot the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached.
Here a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline was already offered, which makes a special appeal in the evening light.
By the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their feet, but faithful to the motto “The City Is Not Sleeping” the day at Times Square was decided.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty was reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then, the financial center around Wall Street went to the 9/11 memorial.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-meter high viewing platform of the Empire-State Building while enjoying the view.
Then, through the hectic drive of the New York streets, we went through the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a brief flight from New York to Boston, students have now arrived at their host families and experience everyday school at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the name of St. Hubertus, a Hubertus fair will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was, according to the saga, a rather ruthless hunter, converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn blower group of the Westphalian hunters under the direction of Brigitte Kluth performs on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) based on ancient, originally French melodies.
The blowers wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders, horses and dog bats musically on trailing hunts.
The solemn mass will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed opslag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to the lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the cafe of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight to the Rhein-Waal University, it does not have to remain in the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with its beautiful name has the aim of making a real stay not only thoughtful, but also hand-held and repeatedly experienceable.
Because it's just fun and it's just nice.
A glance into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at the outset.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually stocked fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as gastronomists before the opening of the decorative café at the Opschlag: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the opschlag, the sympathetic cafe lovers hope for more audience.
Last but not least through the university.
"Which we don't have a specific target group," Daniel Büttner emphasizes.
Instead, the two young students here want to appeal the same way as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee-lover.
The sympathetic owner pair stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew itself in a variety of variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"That's a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the light cafe.
I'd better say one.
Because the harbor festival was more likely to take place outside - Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringing night.
“Successful and funny,” the two 33-year-olds said.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a pronounced fan of event evenings: "You can't do it right for everyone now."
And with an event I always speak only to those who are also interested in the special event.
That’s why events will be the exception with us.
“We want to interfere with the normal operation as little as possible.”
It means: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opschlag in Kleve.
The road, which is becoming more and more a gastronomy mile.
To the pleasure of many Klever, the guests from close and distant and the students who discover the Gastromeile and therefore also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks to the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival at which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had been pleased to come.
At the club's restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker all enjoyed the harmonious co-operation in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also always the right festivity to make honors.
This time writer Rolf Wagener was pleased with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You not only wrote a lot for us, but you also turned so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt thanks," said Erich Schlotmann, chairman of the choir.
The awards for participating in the performances and samples by means of activity bouquets were presented this year to choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations.
Fifth-placed scoreholder Artur Brückner.
A special thank you to the team of club owner Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again enchanted a menu of the highest class, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir samples always on Tuesdays at 7:45 p.m. at the club’s local.
"New voices are always warmly welcome to us," said Schlotmann.
UN announces new goals in poverty reduction
The United Nations is now starting to develop a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, announced twelve years ago.
Ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro this evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They were included in the final draft document to be adopted by world policy leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening that the time has come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that the member states have agreed to initiate a process with which universal, sustainable development goals are agreed,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not spare any effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals.”
Although the SG Achim/Baden has been without a victory for four days, the handball top-league still has a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about this.
Everyone is fully motivated in the matter.
I hope we finally win again.
"Because I don't even know how such a victory taste," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not ripped out any trees at the moment, Malmon lifts the pointing finger in advance.
I have trained a lot of players myself in A-Youth.
Therefore, you will certainly be particularly motivated against your ex-coach.
"It is also necessary to see if there is still reinforcement from the first," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to previous appearances.
Above all, in the covering work and in the switching game, it finally hit enormously.
Opportunities must also be improved.
So I hope my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the vigilant eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to vote for peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the square of independence of the capital.
For the past two weeks, there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by White-ruled Rhodesia and later by South Africa’s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
The rapidly growing economy is at stake because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal warehouses in the northwest could bring over $50 billion investments from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US into the country in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo Party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the Sofala province, a traditional Renamos stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, a spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability.
He told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama regards himself as a "loser" who "wants to use all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo renounced the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement.
“Our vision is to start negotiations again, seriously,” Mazanga said.
Earlier talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide with their heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert in Mozambique.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, urging election reforms, has already declared that she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos’ election success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimiento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – intends to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but she has carried out unrest-raising attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection.
Most battles took place in the Sofala province, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied with restraint to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people were already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of abduction.
“People think the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said people simply wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads back,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” says an author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are “too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools”, which is why Crossley-Holland called for a “diligent selection” of works adapted to age.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that for authors and teachers who are "excessively didactic", children would "completely shut down" because in entertaining stories the messages would be conveyed "underlyingly".
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon language and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, stated, “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as possible.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer writing for adults and an author writing for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be sub-represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.
Hansjakob moves back to Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took his retirement residence in Haslach, on Sunday his last years became alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely boring scene play.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, the screenwriter and Hans-Jacob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece, which received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explaining connections and bridged jumps of time from youth to nearing retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returns home to his children's sky, to his courtyard.
And then began the scene play, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht performed with the two-speaker and "Black Forest Foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann was incredibly good at putting himself into the role of the sister and gave her immense life in mimic and gesture.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
In honor of the honorary dignity, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honour, who, in representation of the then office holder Hettich, together with a part of the city council, made his waiting.
Their attendance was then made by the Three-King singer, who prompted Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh, how beautiful, youth memories of my own Three-King period are again alive."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the open courtyard as well as the Storchentag children with their loud "Out, out".
At the time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the church, as did his concerns about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
“A restless spirit had finally found his rest and had gone home forever,” he said at the end of the scene.
There were lots of applause and many praising words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: the hope of the Neckar Giants grows
The chances of remaining in the league of the sportyly lowered Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project waives an application for a possible retreat.
“We will not participate in the wildcard process,” said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic City since 2012.
However, a first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
“We didn’t deal with the wildcard process until it was clear that Düsseldorf won’t get a license,” Neckar Giant Boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until May 23, ascendant Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration court and demonstrate its economic Bundesliga suitability.
To date, the Rhinelanders have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerhole: Evening Supper Church
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the City’s Cultural and Tourism Office dedicates the last of its public theme tours this year on Sunday, October 27, to the Church of the Supper.
After visiting the Atomic Cellar Museum, the Haigerlocher will be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The closing point is a visit to the Church of the Supper.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area.
Last but not least, in the church there is also a view of the painting of the Supper created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an organically faithful reproduction of the famous Milan model by Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point to the other half-hour tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomic Cellar Museum.
Maps are available at the Atomic Cellar Museum cash box.
For questions and information, the tourism office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could testify in Russia as well
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum affair.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, he said.
A departure of Snowden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he will lose his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens extradition there.
Long breath is paid
Six men's teams fought for the winning title in the clubs' tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, with each playing against each.
Played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament leadership was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were at the same time with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to take the decision.
In the victory ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the Hiking Cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the target straight.
The second place was Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier from Team Asphalttriecher.
At the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful finish of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwald Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again in children’s hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program to a colorful children’s and family festival with numerous actions and events.

In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is regarded as a adorable cause because he planned to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart failure, Burt can’t get away with his dream.
With his savings, a pair of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shelves, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there are coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs local residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the shore.
The company has several iron in the fire at the site.
In addition to the import of coal, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbine logistics, among other things.
Black shines the coal on the warehouse in front of the dike.
Distribute or load the coal here as required by two enormous blue coil fillers and backloaders.
With each movement of the envelope devices, a crisp warning sound sounds across the ground.
"The signals are for security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, managing director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, with unfavourable wind, this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the town.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore taken contact with those concerned, the 40-year-old says.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to focus on open dialogue with neighbours.
Matthias Schrell has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on importing coal for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 meter deep bathtub in front of the terminal, capesize bulk carriages can also be handled here for a long time.
“This year we want to break the 3 million-ton brand on the envelope,” Schrell said.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, coal imports into inland power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant goes to the grid, there are more than 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second transport belt could produce up to 10 million.
Bavaria basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketballers of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can prevent us from believing in winning even against the best team in Europe of the past two years," Bavaria coach Svetislav Pesic scored after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball exists in Munich too!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, Munich sold very well for a long time, but were simply not sufficiently clarified in the decisive phases.
The guests managed to turn a 15-point retreat into a guide 13 minutes before Piraeus turned the game again.
"We fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made light-hearted mistakes," Bavaria professional Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our achievement, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers in Munich, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two games against Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre at Broadway, began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has been expanded, as was last at the New York Comedy Festival.
Started and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Stand-Up Institution of Caroline, the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headliners started with Caroline’s and then became more and more successful until they were known to play in a club at some point,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians attending the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slipy fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic W. Kaumau Bell focused on race themes) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the festival’s biggest visitor magnets is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a prestigious television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the moderator of a television show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me, when he's here, sometimes he walks through the street between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, then maybe I live here."
Iran satisfied with nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
“After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years,” Foreign Minister Mohammed Djawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the chief nuclear negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game camcorders with machete
Two children admitted to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machets and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper El País reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they played football in front of their homes in a working-class district.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the young man they had taken with them should testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
When the girl, however, described the attack before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted to the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elder called a rivalry in the football game, among other things.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth hospital.
Cowboy has to go to jail
Due to exploitative human trafficking, rafting, threat, insult and dangerous personal injury, the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper in Afghanistan after two operations, gave a confession as part of a trial agreement.
Accordingly, he met women in five cases via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who raised partly for him for years.
By confiscation of cell phones and SIM cards, he undermined women’s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them partly monitor to control their revenue.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he suffered a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan killed him in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert suggested great doubts about mental constraints and thus limited guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear the injured women.
According to one Kripo official, at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking were identified after a first announcement by telephone surveillance measures.
The heard talks were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, has yet to make a statement.
It is a "completely broken personality" that views violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He had separated himself from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after being detained," he said.
Oil Price Continues to Up to $96 per Barrel
Oil prices continued to drop on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
In the late morning, the reference crude oil for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in European e-commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, there was evidence of increased demand due to two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery of China’s economy, whose growth rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching the lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude oil, a benchmark for international crude oil that is also used by U.S. refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on NYPD stop-and-risk policy
A federal appeal court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the order of a judge calling for changes to the New York Police Department’s Stop-and-Frisk program and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal declared that judge Shira Scheindlin’s decisions would be suspended until a city appeal was decided.
The judge ruled in August that the city was in violation of the Constitution with the way the program for the arrest and interrogation of persons is implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a surveillance body to assist the police in changing its policy and the corresponding training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on Tuesday on the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge must be released from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of bias; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted black and Latin American men in an inappropriate manner with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including policy reforms, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with cameras worn on the body in neighborhoods where most checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons dismissed after a police check.
A hearing on the appeal of the city is scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of the partisan Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men of all minorities filed a lawsuit which turned into a collective lawsuit.
Advocates of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-risk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police, as well as influence the way other police chairs implement the settlement.
Opponents believe the changes would dampen the morality of the police, but not the crime; money would also be wasted, and the broader problem of a police that is under pressure after the elimination of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the stop-and-risk practice, which was constitutional, but only reforming the way the NYPD implements controls.
The Happiness of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds in achieving only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth anniversary of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable success.
The first chairman Henne reported extensively on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in 2004 in Mauritania at the Cheijk Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, another cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous surgeries on several trips on the ground.
During the speeches, images of the entries were shown on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the above-mentioned actions.
The club’s desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to act in an advisory role at the club.
In 2008, Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a poverty quarter on the edge of the capital, as a volunteer in the record time of almost a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be wegrationalized.
A lot is learned in Africa as a medical practitioner, says henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to hospital in various areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly shipped to Africa, so in March this year medical equipment, medicines, bandage material, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided abundant local colours by telling about the experiences of the Stammheim musicians who traditionally supported the association during their journey from Mauritania.
As his personal motives, he named his work in the field of audit as a young member of Parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Furthermore, Fuchtel stressed that global economy also requires global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in attempting to confirm a false tip about an affair with then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special counselor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack and persecuted Pawlby's voicemails, but Coulson also called her and left news as the court learned.
“In the prosecutor’s view, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one standing in front of people’s home hoping to catch them on fresh act, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, monitoring, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the monitoring, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denied it, but we said, “What if he knew about it?”
Rumors about a Clarke affair were first picked up by the feature editorial of NotW when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A band of voicemails from her phone from at least three occasions was seized in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the time the research was running, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about her, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to release tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman for an affair when he himself had a relationship with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny that they had conspired to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned wealth tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A arbitration meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over wealthy taxes, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered into a blind alley after a failed arbitration meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations in Paris on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014 onwards.
The opposite side also remained tough.
The strike announced by the end of November will now be carried out, the chief Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The games scheduled between November 29 and December 2 in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are therefore out of play.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the civic information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Approximately 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and bring ideas.
Heussler stated: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flood that hit Gechingen unpreparedly on May 15, 2009, was an impressive event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler said.
A river area investigation was commissioned with the neighboring municipality Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many lands as possible is the goal," Häußler said.
Based on the planning of the protection against a statistically expected flood every 100 years, according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% surcharge.
In expert circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The mass of water that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1,000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," Häußler said.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality expecting to receive national grants of around 70 percent.
Heußler, however, pointed out that funding only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
The community needs the participation of the citizens.
An extensive planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) provides local measures in the influx of the river Irm from the Stammheim Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and restraint pools were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist designer of the commissioned engineering office Wald und Corbe in Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in sum.
In addition, it is necessary to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Anxiety prevailed among those of the Altort, who, even in normal thunderstorms, have repeatedly suffered from an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known to the administration and first steps have already been taken.
Heußler, however, pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different than for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three-year rain events could be endured.
Sizing the sewage ducts larger would devour millions.
Severely injured after collision
Early Friday afternoon, on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf, two drivers were severely injured in a frontal collision.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could initially say little about the accident.
However, there are several testimony that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles crashed together, with the woman being caught up so hard that it took the fire brigade almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both of the victims arrived in nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a searcher, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Amazing the kinship in the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevsky is to be understood with his massive work as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is certainly something in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes Two thousand ones.
Dick explains America – the realm of breathtaking technical progress, paired with paranoia, security madness, and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had God’s experiences, his late books read like a mixture of John’s Revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He realized early that the calculators are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "minority report" dates back to 1956, spreading the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
Here the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", which is now more or less official White House doctrine.
In Dick's world, which is terrifyingly similar to ours, mutants look into the future - and the police are attacking.
"We are capturing individuals who have not violated any law," the head of the authority said.
“We’re grabbing them even before they can commit a violent crime.”
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, for this we have a prison camp full of pessudo criminals." They read time streams.
They assume that bad things are happening and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick’s narrative works like the blueprint for the NSA’s anti-terrorism laws and abuse noise.
Anticipation of the attack: Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works as well.
Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no division of power, the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is crazy.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only takes errors and sacrifices into account, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it combats.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Testimony to Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum statements in the U.S. spy affair around Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Earlier, Greens MP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
NSA disclosures intensify company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deeply across the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany’s financial capital.
At the order of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German internal intelligence service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a discussion between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage opportunities “to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower employee, started publishing his filling horn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders haven’t been sure if they can take the director’s speech.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new peak because of state surveillance.
The barrel overflowing brought the disclosure that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was twisted, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get targeted, business management is certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now posed nearly as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published by consultant company EY in July.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there has been no evidence that the US has passed on the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software manufacturer SAP.
If one had wanted a strong European IT industry, they should not have been extinct 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, reach and technical sophistication of U.S. espionage agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest espionage risk in China.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, as European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the jurisdiction there and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after disclosures about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about 10 percent of non-U.S.-based members rejected plans to use an U.S. provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says, “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it’s where my data is stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in this legal area?”
Many German business leaders are of the opinion that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
“It has been an issue for many years and has not changed fundamentally due to the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate management usually doesn’t boast of the countermeasures that have been taken, because this gives attackers benefits.
In large companies, employees have long been told that taking a free USB stick at a fair or letting an unguarded laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at Audi Automobile Manufacturer, says it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they can not be used as listening devices.
The German BAT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain attackable against hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their respective niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BAT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimates in February ranked France, Russia and Israel behind China as the second of the countries that used economic data from the hacking.
A board member of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The intelligence services know very well that even if they work together in the fight against terror, all countries are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe gives answers to wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important discovery journey that man can make,” said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has moved in again.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In front, the clothes are closed with embroidery, often with a veil, but in the rear, they go down their backs and often end in a trail.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes, the ghosts divorce from the fashion house Kleidermüller.
For men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but it can also be chosen cream or brown combinations.
The selection of the place is important, it was explained.
Jewelryless adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here, the domain drew attention to its own offer in the discount.
Whoever wants to go with the carriage then Uwe Link has an offer for him.
“But coaches are also popular for boys’ farewells,” he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successful
For repeatedly, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful in a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he scored 87 points twelve.
Susi Höpp and her Woody in Class 1 faced the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up Ringer mat in the gym at his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11 in a upright mat that stood behind the tribune in the school tower hall.
Investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family doubts.
“They are convinced their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson’s lawyer, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he died as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that it is without any logic, in violation of the laws of physics as well as of common sense,” says Crump.
Rather, be convinced that the truth is concealed in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to learn and returned in the body bag,” he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there was going to be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important questions remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggests Johnson died from the consequences of “position-related choking.”
A second autopsy, however, resulted in another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil law investigation into Johnson’s death, he will commission the FBI to carry out the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos that investigators have checked.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained clues to how he died.
CDC publishes allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-based children with food allergies is rising.
One in every 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to CDC.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies and how to treat children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the EpiPen brand’s auto-injection is most commonly used – to address a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Legislators in the states have recently changed the regulations so that schools can keep epinephrine in stock easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something presses on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair lies on it,” or “My tongue crawls.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “gender indefinitely”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognized for children born with unambiguous genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can indicate "undetermined" or "undetermined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to remove the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgery for gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I remain the flickwork that was created by doctors mutilated and full of scars.
An estimated one in 2,000 children every year is born neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most U.S. experts advise you to use the best available information on gender assignment if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before you – if at all – decide on surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law “sheeps for a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people should be distinguished from transgender or transgender people because their status is not related to gender, but rather due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, in Australia and Nepal it is possible for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or "third sex".
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "genderless" person after a court granted lifelong retention of "undefined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German passports will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
Gender issues are still controversial in neighboring France, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, stating: “If the world is distorted into a new state where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we twist two pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn infant from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
“Parental life is already stressful enough, even without any further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your own child,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, medicine saw sex as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors may also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, it was not called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treating children with unambiguous genitalia comes from Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed gender was formable.
He defined the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental impulses – how parents raise a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, defining whether a person considers himself male or female.
But in a case known as "John/Joan" in 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a faulty circumcision to completely castre the child and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the internet's invasion, survivors of these gender surgeries have been made public, who are "not happy with the outcome".
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY-male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were unclear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
As a result of the surgery, he became infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called the Interface Project to make intersex people perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can encourage “to stamp and stigmatize.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a ‘unstable’ decision to the child,” she said.
We are afraid that this favors interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australia’s law because “it allows adults to be recognised as a third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,” she said.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time.
When you grow up, you can decide on your own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law “empowers” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents room so they don’t have to make decisions in a hurry,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way everything is okay – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness.
And you don’t have to rush to do an operation that can no longer be reversed.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents drive out because they think they wouldn’t do the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides the gender that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girl by shot from car
Unknowns injured a 12-year-old woman in Saxony-Anhalt in shooting from a car.
The perpetrators had probably fired a group of children Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure force.
The police told the castle.
The girl was slightly injured at the left wade.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police investigate, it said Friday.
Up to now, the police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to egg-throwing children who threw them against house façades.
Since the owners of the house recognized this in time and removed the egg remains in the same way, no material damage was likely to have occurred either.
Furthermore, some Sylvesterböller were probably also fired in the city area, but there was no harm in matters either.
A resident on the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his cycling blinds were stolen.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his cycling blinds in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to take any further action.
Living with a future perspective
Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
It is just a few minutes to the city by public transport.
"Hopefully you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I’ve been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the concern of being unable to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment at age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the half-fifty has had to experience on her own what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently, she published a book on the topic ‘Happy living in old age – Which form of housing is the best for me?’.
“Our apartment is the best example of what’s not going to happen in old age,” she starts telling.
When she moved to the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, at the mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the topic of 'Housing at age'.
Most of them displace it as long as it is possible.
“Only the others get old,” she says.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really high, think about it.
“It may be too late,” says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 residential models for a self-determined living at age.
“What form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision,” she explains.
There is no solution for the age.
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they could also get sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the local language, one can also be united in the Dolce Vita,' gives the professional book author Aussiedlungswilligen to consider.
Their models include classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited retiree WG.
At old age everybody has their ticks and macks
“For me, this is not a house,” she says with a blink of eyes.
Not at all as in a student cottage with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
“At age, you just need your retreat rooms,” says Ries.
That a senior community can still work, the book author does not want to exclude.
But this should be different than in the classical student-WG.
Sometimes you just want your rest,” she believes.
With this opinion, at least, it is not alone in the state capital.
“Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long as they can,” is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service Living at the age of the state capital.
Their department advises people on the topic of ‘becoming older’.
That is why the elderly would often also take advantage of inconveniences and restrictions only to be able to stay in their usual environment, as is the experience of Stiftung Warentest.
There are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that anyone who is concerned with the age-appropriate renovation of their home or apartment first get thoroughly informed and not hire the first craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat raise, the interior designer clarifies.
But it is not always possible to redesign the existing apartment age-appropriately and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is more afraid than before the spider at her home door.
US wants Snowden to continue criminal prosecution
The U.S. has not changed its attitude toward former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He is also accused of disclosing unauthorized secret information.
Therefore, he has to face criminal proceedings in the United States, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent remarks wouldn’t change this.
Earlier, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States not to continue threatening him with punishment after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow.
Psaki emphasized that Ströbele’s remarks are that of a parliamentarian and not that of a German government member.
Snowden is willing to talk to German authorities.
First, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
The former NSA employee sought by the United States made this clear in a letter not addressed published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and furthered it to the federal government, the Bundestag and the federal attorney general.
The letter has the following words after a translation distributed by Ströbele:
To the Responsible
I was asked to write to you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractual or direct as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became a witness to systematic violations of the laws of my government, which led me to act from a moral duty.
As a result of the release of these concerns, I was exposed to serious and persistent harassment that forced me to leave my family and homeland.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the disclosures of a system of all-round surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage disclosures resulted in many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at formerly covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these insights are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken have been significantly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of loyalty and strives to criminalize and charge political opinion.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will reject this detrimental attitude.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate in adequately and in accordance with the law in the responsible investigation of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, especially with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and thank you for your efforts to safeguard international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterlingen’s mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has been sold to a private person.
The municipal council approved the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
“The community is satisfied,” says Maier.
In the budget there were 100,000 euros.
It is still unclear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and clearing the walkway.
“This effort is now gone,” Maier rejoices.
Square concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a square concert on the terrace of the Gasthaus Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock stick at 7:30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
Chairman Manuela Honeck presents the pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked everyone who had helped successfully overcome the first musician hock.
Obama Campaign Thoughts to Replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisors have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, the New York Times said.
The unveiling is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times has a copy of the coming book and she reported Thursday evening that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to find out if it would look better for Obama’s fading hope of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Policy Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly outlines the history of the campaign’s and White House leaders’ efforts, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values of exchanging former Foreign Minister Clinton for the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President’s closest advisors—including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisor David Axelrod and David Plouffe—knew about the proposed change.
In "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite his "narrow, personal relationship" before it was finally decided against such a move after the data showed that Clinton's candidature "would not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a lot of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
One must remember that the president had horrible survey values at the time, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what are we doing?”
While Daley described the investigations as "offered care," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that during the re-election campaign, considerable effort had been made to find out if such a move would pay off with regard to the polls.
“In campaigns, not so much money is spent on polls and focus groups if you don’t think about something seriously,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said he did not believe that the president was “conscious” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" would not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political surveys would have reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama knew nothing of the investigations on whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
What happens to my email on the way?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was e-mail technically implemented in the design of the Internet service similar to the conventional post?
In the design of early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have failed to provide a stable foundation for a soundproof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds more to an open postcard than to a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna's email program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run through a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Will conventional emails be read along the way through the web?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the go.
The provider of the sender usually checks whether the mail includes a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
Furthermore, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that will be deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Are unknown people also reading the emails?
The likelihood that unauthorized persons will read an email is extremely small.
Theoretically, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal possibilities to intercept or take notice of emails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an email communication so that it is not even easy to recognize who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
In the mainly privately used mailboxes, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role, according to an August 2013 investigation by Convios Consulting.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had fallen recently, Google’s GMail was able to increase significantly.
Mother hid in the forest and cashing retirement
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care.
In order to continue receiving pension and nursing, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
At first he covered up the deaths of the 89-year-olds, then he decreased the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old must be held responsible for fraud, as a spokesman said Friday.
According to the report, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: at the time he noticed that the mother in need of care no longer needed medication.
The retiree told the investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old admitted the death of his mother.
An obduction, according to the police, did not provide any evidence of a capital crime.
Do you want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice cream in the dark – using medulla.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the marine animals, creating a bright treat.
The idea came to him after he had read a research paper on medulla and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the bright protein.
When consumed, the ice cream reacts with the tongue, which increases the pH in the protein and triggers the luminance.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH rises and the ice lights.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the pomegranate is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says, “I want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is in itself impossible due to the light-breaking caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a medulla that are artificially made by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball league after six days of play.
The team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow will play the derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated their first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season begins for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads free," Ehler's behaviour is optimistic.
He finally has his entire team at his disposal, except for the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverden also plays on pace, as we do.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is necessary to increase the coverage, which recently left anything but a certain impression.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is clearly more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re still not the favorite, because in derby everything can always happen.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to drop down in Morsum to start a series.
Lack of Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this purpose, A-Youth Joost Windsuß, who is active with double playing rights at the A-Youth Bundesliga HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I will probably not do so this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep as far as Halloween is concerned.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting inanimate objects are the last scream.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive foods such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Spacemen will get it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and weren’t alone with it to my amazement.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That’s a lot of “hot dogs”.
As far as candy is concerned, we are not timid.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, sweets, sweets and rubber bears.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce says 41 million people are moving through the neighborhoods with the saying “sweets or saures”.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not eat – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilos of it are sold on Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Makers.
That's about nine billion corn seeds.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing is more part of Halloween than houses where it is spying.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, stands in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially-recognized cheating houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos that you’re just pissing in your pants and then putting your friends on Facebook, where you don’t get rid of them again, and then the guy you’re standing on leaves a comment like “nice face expression.”
But let's finally come to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us acquainted with the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we made from a young age.
Fortunately, the “Baby in the Pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving up the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lamp, which slowly rots in the front garden, is probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve out something pretty from their 921 kilogram pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: rescue workers find a carbonized body
Firefighters had to leave in Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
The rescue workers are bringing a coaled body out of the house.
Rescue workers found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday night it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighters arrived, the flames were already blowing out of a window.
The operatives went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer inhabitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
Background is a possible lack of pastors: the Evangelisch-Lutherische Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of its currently approximately 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030.
For today’s young people, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in a conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day routine yourself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation.
Burfien traces this back to the process of de-Christianization: “God’s voice is quiet, the world is loud.”
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and can place my priorities where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Of course, in the free economy, more will be paid, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This comes to meet today’s young people, who are not just about careers, but about a sense-filled work.
According to the state church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariate.
In thinly populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize studies for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
In the interior there are race seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support for Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers coming to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are delighted to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newbies for the stresses and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge – this will be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called to rescue a dog who was trapped 15 meters above ground on a dangerous rock projection in a quarry
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered in her miserable location by a walker in the quarry.
Firefighters roped off the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The firefighters managed to bring a dog to safety, which sat fast in a rock wall on a 15 meter high protrusion.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby fled after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who belongs to the dog, came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and posted aid calls on social networks when she fled to the quarry after the small road accident.
Around 4:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker running his dog saw the stuck Ruby on the 15-meter-high heel in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station technical rescue team rushed to the spot and roped to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move any muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen.
But she's all right now.
She then ate a couple of dog cakes.
This was a rather unusual task.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby had a huge luck.”
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "To see the rescue was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in her arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had grown too big and it had collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never touched Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the altrocker, and that "he excavated me when I was 18."
She added, “It’s been a long time ago and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denied that he had ever attempted to approach Katy Perry.”
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singer who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" landed in number 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European separation gives Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for membership of the EU.
This is the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with spindle wire along the Hadrian’s Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this was expected to play no role in the headlines.
Also, no one has mentioned that EU member states often rectify their strict rules when it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued non-compliance for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
Actually, no story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already looks like a fossil: the first time I heard the "independence means passport checks" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost when repeating this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, made after the war, has fallen stuck.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Parties across the EU are gaining ground that are anti-EU or want to throw the euro over as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win nearly five million votes in the September Bundestag election and thus effectively drive the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance against the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Due to the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is forced by holding onto the common currency, many people believed that the project Europe had gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates, which are beneficial for German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, Southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – inspired by Berlin.
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deepening European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry is paying twice as much for electricity as the United States and four times for gas.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All wage records in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt arises, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris on the same level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe for its own economic policy, which has to fight the distressed French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-enemy Front National has just won a decisive re-election, hence referring the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of votes – a timely warning to the British Labour party that it cannot assume a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French workers?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point to which I want to go further: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (ultimately) Small-England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels where they can go.
I suspect that Scotland could drive very well in a looseer European association, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise we should consider making Norway the same and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP administration in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity policy in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem Coalition had to blame for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to be forced on an austerity policy by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white older cousins, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean puberty.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and sham hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association this week in Orlando, Florida, paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is coming quickly,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axle hair, as well as body odor, are shown in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarch (occurrence of the first menstrual bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“If breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to develop,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with this common problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is “early” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, testing by an endycronologist could be indicated to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the child’s age, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is constrained in terms of medication, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls unlike their elderly cousins.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how to handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter, at the age of ten, got her days.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are caused.
Boys are similar to girls in puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study involving girls aged six to nine, which links body fat to entry into puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white older cousins.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and shame hair is growing earlier, the trend toward a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you have to have a conversation sooner than expected,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who flourish early need insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers dispute over seat width in face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-distance flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines are most endeavouring to, but this designated space is the key to claims of efficiency on the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus called for an industry standard this week, prescribing a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. arch rival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The fight comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from November 17th to 21st.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is critical to the stated economic results that the new “mini jumbo” design will deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" holds 406 people with seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide, thus allowing ten per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share technical details through advertising in the specialized press.
Now Airbus appeals directly to the public before the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company introduced an advertisement that could be the start of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people sitting in a restaurant, with the title, “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo props,” says Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Leahy.
In the face of changing dietary habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-distance journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival follows a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the newly named "jet set" was narrower.
Research has been conducted, according to Airbus, showing that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denied Airbus’ numbers on the seat dimensions, saying it is not in the manufacturers’ discretion to decide how airlines will balance airfares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to research, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to succeed,” said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow-freeness, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the fight is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion in list prices in the coming decades, which could have a sustained impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the fight over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20% more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements about the results depend in part on comparing the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
Increased unit costs are still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is pressing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the narrower arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, Airbus’ offering is controlled from the threat from the 777,” says Mary Kirby, cabin facility expert, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers that airlines can choose from.
World traveling jet sellers even carry band measurement to measure the facility in competition.
Even if they acknowledge the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10-seater rows, but has not yet sold, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the gears for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be pushed, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could stop smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before testing on humans, further trials are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to not experience nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice administered nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a “pause,” the researchers explained, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccines had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could be given to children if they were quite sure before they came into the temptation to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, smokers would use it to quit.
“Then they know that when they start smoking again, they don’t feel any more pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to quit the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denied being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the State Corruption Supervisory.
The former NSW minister denied that he had changed the provisions for maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had covert holdings in three lands in state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission Against Corruption) extended its investigations on Friday on whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers to lease contracts at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without advice to extend after their expiry in August 2005.
It is now being investigated on the charge that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the land after Tripodi's former deputy staff chief Lynne Ashpole announced on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for rental contracts.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which earned the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was Port Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted in favour of public tenders.
But he refused to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had urged a redesign of the government's lease arrangements.
A telephone record submitted to ICAC showed conversations from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Harbour Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
“Was the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing schemes?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I can’t remember what was being discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli hunting planes attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal had been, but said it had been at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries to Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “authenticity test”
As part of extended measures, the Government is considering a "authenticity test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used with a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used for occupying unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for moving family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government proposal for discussion was released after former labor party deputies Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments on foreign workers because they could be seen by Australia’s neighbors as insulting.
“Loud statements such as ‘foreigners should work back’ and ‘Australians first’ are a very unpleasant recurrence in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers were to be protected – and if some in the region perceived an echo of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The debate proposal outlines twelve measures that were once proposed by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday at talks about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "authenticity criterion" is adopted, the person applying for a visa could be checked to verify whether "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting undertaking."
Companies could also be required to hold accountable for the number of 457 visa holders after in the past companies, which initially wanted to support only a small number of workers, eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum claimant probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week on a refugee boat.
The deadly nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for since his father died Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd it is proposed that high-speed connections between Scotland and northern England start from Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, said the project "will bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip of finally three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our target for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unambiguously" work for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection holds the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland’s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to investigate options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to jointly decide on the next steps.
Electronic device regulations on aircraft remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones when they take off and land, despite efforts in the United States to loosen the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, watch or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in “flight mode.”
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at departure and landing.
Australian airlines are watching the decision that the U.S. airlines must do lots of work to implement, but do not pursue immediate plans to change their regulations.
CASA also stated that the announcement will be reviewed, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
"CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," it said.
The topic is subject to provisions which require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin personnel.
Virgin has already conducted talks with CASA about expanding its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and stated that it is open to change but that it needs to be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a CASA review of the approval of electronic devices because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said we will remain with the current regulations until further.
“Our current policies provide that electronic devices are not allowed to be used at launch and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers, and we will surely take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision will have different effects on U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances through mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said.
In rare cases, in cases of poor vision, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment should be safely stored under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when starting and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, some BVB pendants with lighting missiles had created ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced severe consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic that offered the viewer in the Signal Iduna Park until shortly before the pitch of the Bundesliga game between German Vice-Master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart.
Most of the guest fans were heard with their songs.
On the other hand, the southern tribune, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented themselves exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle calls.
The podium of Capo, who otherwise coordinates the joint encouragement, remained unoccupied.
And in the front of the tribune a large flag blowing lonely with the inscription "Section Stadium prohibition".
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always the first BVB player to enter the square, began short-term joy.
As his teammates followed, there were loud singing and blowing scarves - but not everywhere for a long time.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the Southern Tribune, nothing was excited.
The fact that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a celebration mood.
Only five minutes before the pitch the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension until then almost tangible with hands escaped in a loud scream, as Dickel as usual asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
The last one was the Southern Tribune as usual - and finally here was again the loudest place in the stadium as usual.
And at the latest, when the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came from the southern tribune with an appeal, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the audiences and onto the square - and nearly hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and it is believed that Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday night.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from choreography for the home match against the VfB Stuttgart.
“I forbidden it,” he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment – until Tuesday they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
“It’s going to be incredible,” Watzke said.
You can be curious what the reactions will be on the Southern Tribune.
Deposit houses boom in Singapore as crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a deposit house at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to be able to pay her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there’s all my money in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 in Singapore (about 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
Indeed, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is so great that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, this week became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pledging jewelry is not only a fast way to get money – $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, deposit houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just over the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need for creditworthiness verification or proof of income, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
This is why millions of people in the region turn to bondhouses after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose financial policies in developed economies, lower- and medium-income families are looking for deposit houses to compensate for the difference in a stabbing economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, described as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
According to the Agency, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week hardly came out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic gold prices peaks over the past two years have increased the trend of pledgeing personal items as people take the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items pledged in the city state’s 200 bondhouses are gold.
People say, “The gold price looks good, let’s pledge Grandmother’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
The largest Thai depository operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% customer growth in its branches over the past few months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside of Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company funds that with 60 percent of the $66 million Singapore it took this week with the Singapore stock market.
While some lenders have fallen into crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that depository houses not only lend cheaper interest than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
“Customers borrow items they already possess, and the liquefaction of personal valuables does not increase the household training,” she explains.
The deposit loan business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use deposit loans are in financial difficulty.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social layer come to us.
“This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Intelligence discoverer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany uncover the ever-increasing NSA spying affair.
Hans-Christian Ströbele, MEP of the Grünen-Bundestag, said his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia looked at the conditions under which the former intelligence official would testify to a German prosecutor’s office or to an investigative committee.
Snowden has pointed to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to prevent a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has set up an emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency relief for election benefits.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for grey stars, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day-to-day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better aftercare after hospital stays, specialist medical training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic recording system for health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that clinicians have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian healthcare system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability duty by the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission is set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effective and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they were not accompanied by real reforms that would bring the Tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the worry list,” Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the opposition’s health policy spokesman, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is just a “pavement solution”.
“We are in today’s situation because the laboratory state government has withdrawn $430 million from the healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government tears nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and puts 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier food than necessary.
The story played in France in the 1760s tells the touching story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family.
As she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another’s erotic fascination.
The film never slips down into lusty or sensational desire – and that’s where his problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a tormenting shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing capability, a surveillance group said.
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas munitions production facilities, the global chemical weapons surveillance group said Thursday, while serious clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites allegedly stored toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
1 November, the Hague-based organization set Damascus to destroy or make all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons "inoperable", including all machines for the mixing of chemicals into poison gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must start destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility and deposits, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the number of deaths in Syria through a network of activists, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the death toll in the conflict at 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have connections with al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not specify details.
The fighting underlines the danger to which chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, as their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time amidst a tumultuous civil war.
According to OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed all of the major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites were abandoned, according to Syrian statements, and the chemical weapons program objects there were relocated to other facilities mentioned, which were inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee.
“I draw the hat of the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director General of the Surveillance Organization in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad’s government and their security forces, many members of the Alawites, a separation of Shia Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he said.
Anger over judgment of Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angry at the judgment of the last of the instigators who were brought to trial as Umar Patek believed to be shot legally.
Patek, who was one of Southeast Asia’s most sought after fleeing for almost ten years, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing.
With a penal suspension, he could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in Kuta’s popular tourist district, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A series of terrorist-related charges were also convicted, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor's office had called for a life imprisonment, even if it could have applied for the man who is also known as a master bomb builder for his reputation as "Demolition Man".
The decision has awakened painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation done by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“We should put him in front of a shooting command,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with no other grandchildren and never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was equated to the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell in coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
Leaving him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be tried.
He deprived himself of nearly a decade of arrest, but was eventually seized in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had provided a hint that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t stand up,” Corteen said.
Until recently he has shown no regret for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The judgment came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be commemorated in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can appeal his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but do not have cell phone calls)
Air travellers can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, listening to music and watching movies from departure to landing, but not by phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the regulations for the storage of equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could soon approve the extended use of electronic devices,” the FAA said in a statement.
Passengers currently have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not re-start until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
On arrival, the passengers must turn them off again and not be allowed to take them off again before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even on departure, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been refitted for the use of Wi-Fi at larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional flight attendant association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like watchers on this issue.
However, Internet connections for browsing, exchange of emails, text messages or downloading data less than three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority said.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still not “Words With Friends,” the scrabble-like online game actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the climb.
And heavier devices such as laptops need to continue to be stored, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Cell phone calls during the flight also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at landing and starting
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a safety expert on national transport issues, told CBS News that mobile phones were still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt broadcasting posts,” Rosenker said.
A industry advisory committee launched by the FAA to investigate this issue last month recommended that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA to ease restrictions on use has increased.
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore turning off the device.
In 1966, the FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air passengers after reports of interferences in navigation and communications devices by FM radios carried by passengers became known, which at the time represented the latest technological trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they don’t mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for a few years when flight height is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation when you flip over.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are higher.
Among the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, employees of the company loaded a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but were unable to detect.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes that the interference with the equipment is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports of pilots talking about a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to order the shutdown of the equipment by passengers when landing instruments under poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travelers who would now be equipped with extensive technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Saved bird released by North Sea Drilling Island Air Rescue Service
An air rescue bird flew to the coast that had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island was released back into nature.
The water roof was flown to Aberdeen by helicopter last month, where it was picked up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water roar was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added, “He couldn’t fly anymore, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
When they were released, the water roots were again fit and healthy.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives representing the UK’s corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside of Europe and focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while the EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to favor new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil instead of stopping the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked about their views on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key skills should be restored to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, as the costs of Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with those that are traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and that probably says most, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of UK wants a course to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which can be found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for “significant change” that brings the booklet of action back to Britain.
It’s about a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favour of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the UK economy stands behind his plan for renegotiating the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means a greater focus on trade for companies and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to increase the diversity of Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which most of Russian gas is stored for Europe, is concerned about an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks linked to transit countries were "forever" shut down.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other secondary countries are expected to begin on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate site in Germany.
The economic framework data are right, and the financing opportunities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in European comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Jones Lang LaSalle’s Europe, Middle East and Africa, pointed out this at the 9th real estate day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
How sought-after German commercial real estate, the look at the transaction volume, Ulbrich said.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France, 19%.
"Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff charged with accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child-related sexual offences before accusations were brought against child caregivers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children reported.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it “never had to do with an incident of sexual abuse of children in the organization.”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was inquired about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher was convicted of abuse of children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s declaration of opening to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “there were external checks of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognized as the front line in child safety”.
Instead, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at YMCA at age 21, admitted that the management had failed to hire Lord "from me downwards" and did not ensure that employees had been clear about their obligations to report breaches of the child safety guidelines.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year YMCA work.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding children’s safety.
The employees said they observed violations, among other things that Lord was alone with children, cared for them privately as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, said that Child Service Manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the supervisor of the Lords at YMCA Caringbah, “was very intimidating and most of the time very inappropriate.”
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord impaired their judgment, which is why they did not report him.
Hare stated that he had communicated his view to the Board of Directors of YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord" incident "does not concern the reporting" by employees, and that the Board of Directors had agreed to him.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations appeared was made by YMCA Child Services Managing Director Liam Whitley.
He said that it was to prevent contamination of evidence, but that was "over-eagerly" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse of children, told the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" with the recruitment, review, recruitment, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
Asked whether he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by London’s Evening Standard by saying, “Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so . . .
When the horse show experts came to Cardiff for the Horse of the Year, they were aware that there was a tough competition.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who wasn’t even in kindergarten and took his first steps just a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee walked loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both of which are equal in size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap on a horrible angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which were far above his age.
And Toffee received best scores for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has since practiced with the Shetland pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great thing."
They had to compete against the entire competition field and left the pitch with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showcasing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The whole audience was like electric and everyone encouraged and clapped him.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
Just as he started, it won’t take long before he’s on the horse of the year – and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the presentation ring.
They pay attention to good collaboration between pony and leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s sweet clothes helped her part, which really fit perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after calling
A Chinese newspaper, which on the front page called for the release of a reporter charged with defamation, was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to counterfeit reports of a sub-government company.
The New Express is now undergoing “comprehensive rectification,” the regulator said.
The "Retification Order" was issued by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was disordered,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said she had decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter license.
“The Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete the rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant leaders of the New Express be identified and that the management team of the New Express be reviewed immediately.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express reporting on alleged financial irregularities with a construction machinery manufacturer named Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the cover page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he published false reports for payment.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told state news station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out on money and glory.
I realized I did wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that the reports were not correctly reviewed.
Several known suspects have recently confessed on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely forced, despite a law change early in the year in which authorities were forbidden to force someone to blame themselves.
Narcotic tunnel discovered with its own railway between the United States and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical railway operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-inch 90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they’d ever found.
The zigzag tunnel, which runs over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless invisible warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unidentified, the authorities said.
The discovery of the tunnel secured eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the court records.
Three men who worked as drivers, according to the authorities, were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened to be sentenced to prison for between ten years and a lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which challenges the drug cartels to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long railway passage that went from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about the separation of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was scheduled to broadcast on Friday, Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope it is."
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old emphasized.
“We will support and love each other as Flynn’s parents.”
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism is subject to vegetarianism according to the lexicons, but is quite different from it.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream or a powerful Edamer, these snacks are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to renouncing meat and fish, the vegan leaves all the consumption of animal products - also honey is denied.
What remains, you might wonder, but if you look closer, the vegan diet world is characterized by a remarkable ingenuity.
"Bread coatings are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealander has been vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
Around the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not just because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also in other everyday concerns without animal products.
Being vegan is an ethics.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” says Proctor, the Vegan Maxime, which covers all consumption behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, stirrers or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, being vegan is not a renunciation, it's not an asceticism, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that with dietary changes you reduce the choice of food options, Proctor is more likely to go back to the power of habit.
And precisely these conditioning led some of the well-meaning attempts to fail.
“The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that makes many quit quickly, similar to smoking,” Proctor makes a comparison.
And he says, "Some tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
“But you can also produce the same effect in other ways,” explains the vegan.
For a barbecue party, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and some vegan sausages.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should quite once taste delicately.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
“It’s supposed to taste, but it’s not just about reducing it to animal food,” Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he had not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don’t take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who diet exclusively vegan.
“My blood tests are fine, I often get checked,” Proctor says.
In particular, many vegan critics warn about the lack of vitamin B12.
“Because animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat purchased in the refrigerator is high in vitamin B12,” Proctor says.
For vegans, it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 values are okay,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go long ways for food procurement.
Basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need I can find on site.
I only buy something special from time to time.
“Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is what is known to be the case with ‘ordinary’ finished products.”
Anyway, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly assumed.
“There’s a lot to discover in the kitchen, with a few small knifes you can achieve good, if not partly better results,” says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake Proctor was also able to surprise his father-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new importance.
“The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, he was also skeptical.
Don't you taste my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip.
"I don't refuse people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to fresh up enclavage.
And more closely viewed, the everyday world then does not appear as vegan-free as suspected - and the vegan does not appear as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Potatoes are everywhere!
"Many döner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates from pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly adjusting to it.
“When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult,” the New Zealander can find a development: “You have to talk to people, make them aware of it.”
“If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, and that in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” Proctor notes.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the outset,” Proctor says.
Buying vegan products can be difficult at first.
Especially if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be contained in peanuts as colouring agents, one seems to quickly leave courage with the observance of ethics in so many obstacles and traps.
Not only for this reason, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients, which are buried in food and detergents.
“It’s sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble,” Proctor says.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingertip that strikes on consciousness.
Perhaps he doesn’t completely manage to get rid of his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to keep its customers in breath.
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a notice, the operator blamed for technical problems.
The other eleven US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger failures with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday had the Nasdaq indices not been calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August of this year, there were two breakdowns in a week alone.
At first, the U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively incorrect purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
As a result, the stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to review and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading ceased due to a computer crash on the Nasdaq exchange for several hours.
In addition, Facebook’s stock market in the past year was in the wake of an eye-opening.
The Nasdaq systems had failed to cope with the flood of purchase and sale orders, later noted the SEC’s stock exchange supervisory, leaving the company to a record $10 million fine.
Konstanz: Radler is driving 63-year-old
According to police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 a.m., was driving a ladies' bike unlawfully on the left walkway from the train station square towards the market place.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped from a shop on the walkway, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to the police.
In the subsequent collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall, went to the ground in the course of further progress, with a space wound of about 15 centimeters long on his head.
An ambulance team took the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police issue assange extradition notice
British police today handed an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had been given an “invitation to stand up,” which called on him to appear at a police station, and added that if he did not comply with this, he was threatened to be arrested.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden on charges of a sexual offence after his possibilities under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
He feared that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, so he had sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
"Scotland Yard has sent an invitation to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time we have chosen," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on deposit.
The embassy did not comment on the notification of the police request.
Assange fears he will be handed over to the United States by Sweden and charged there with possible espionage charges after posting more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Driver who was sitting between his legs at 210 km/h and hot drink will receive a penalty of <0xC2><0xA3>1,000
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
Howie pleaded guilty before the Colchester District Court without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a victim supplement of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London’s speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on homes costing over two million pounds in 2012, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold homes as a company and not as individuals.
Revenues from the stamp tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which were 708 million pounds in fiscal year 2012/13, combined for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp taxes on high-priced housing and the introduction of legislation against circumvention, it is hard to claim that high-quality properties are too low taxed, regardless of the effects of the outdated community tax system.”
“However, this step could prevent some foreign investors from buying or selling real estate in London,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London’s wealthy Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have deepened by a record 11.8 percent last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the south-western part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) saw an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the relationship between the tail of a dog and his mood.
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs had their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view) while it was on the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, as in humans, the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to their fellow-species’ side tailwinds, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these movies from other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the dick moves in one direction, sometimes in the other
Professor Vallortigara said, “We showed dogs movies with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distractions from other aspects, and so we could control the movement of the dick more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the puppy), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was primarily to the left (again from the dog's perspective), their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said, “If you have different encounters with other dogs and wefting your tail in a direction is linked to friendly behaviour and the right side produces less friendly behaviour, then you react based on these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers to better understand their animal’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest stipend at the University of Bristol’s faculty of veterinary medicine, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
Another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when his ‘tail’ is waving to the left rather than to the right instead of becoming restless – exactly the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore arise that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
But since their behaviour is simply recorded, it probably won’t take long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of eighty can no longer participate in the Pope’s election – this falls to a group of 120 “elective cardinals”.
Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said in a statement that a meeting of all cardinals would be held before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, was held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals eligible to vote would likely have declined by February.
He explained that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary for the number of cardinals eligible to vote again to be 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The Consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
Currently, there is a certain overhang on the sides of Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” said Valero.
He said it was “well possible” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we haven’t been in this situation – that’s all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from great places would be called cardinals, but Francis was "full of surprises - so we don't know who he appoints."
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair seat backrest
General Motors is calling back nearly 19,000 of its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest, according to a statement by the U.S. regulator for vehicle safety on Friday.
In some of the carriages there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety on headrests.
“If the vehicle is driven from behind, it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a statement.
The recalled models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
Delivery of the GM trucks started in June and represents the leading U.S. car manufacturer’s most important model launch since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares rose on the New York Stock Exchange by 1.4% to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Despair of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republicans’ blockade tactics.
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare’s website issues that drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a very sad book.
It’s a book that I thought would make me feel strong and give me hope again during the dark second year of my medical studies.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and depicts Barack Obama's memoirs of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics could inspire millions and rob the breath of a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and news speakers stopped to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates were crying with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had an approval of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if you were ripped out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first voted, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and versatile things Obama has accomplished, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that party-political blockade tactics have tilted too many aspirations to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after countless times defending the Obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances, I ended up trying to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign heads of state or to kill innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans’ private lives and why whistleblowers are punished for disclosing state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without proceedings, nor why public financing and spending limits were bypassed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report saying that the White House’s efforts to calm the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the MEP is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to have been largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me most.
I elected Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidature.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unfertilized alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard about so long ago.
But with the decline of Obama’s approval values to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become even harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania pre-elections.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he told his employees they had to return to course and follow the purpose of their case.
“I want us to find our spell again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest on parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mountain tree farmer, who is in a court dispute over the payment of $6 million to CO2 tax, made the claim as he wanted to wipe questions off the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether CO2 and mining taxes will be removed or cut.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets a vacation or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission Palmer officially declared the winner of the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes ahead of the recalculation.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process to make it happen faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you can invade, enter data into a computer, select immediately and then get the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking votes.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
Nowadays, coordinating with pencils is incredible.
The electoral commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy belongs to an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very seriously."
A public service is about service to the public.
“We seek no reward except that of history, namely that we can serve this community in a critical time,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global official investigation of the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly rising.
Some of the world’s biggest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with the authorities in investigating the world’s largest financial market, on which US$5.3 billion daily changes ownership.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation of the scandal about the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
“Our investigation on this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation reported that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the UK Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now reported to have been leave from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on vacation this week and Matt Gardiner, former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
Usher’s Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, said people close to the situation.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Agency Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers are supposed to have settled on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks search instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has set traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low currency volatility restricts the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks leads to “one can already influence the market with very low ticket prices”.
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it dismissed a trader of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately informed the competent authorities and worked with them.
“We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained,” said Credit Suisse.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss Meadow" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle grounds on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and broadened the footpath, it says in a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the site is threatening to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed the embellishment action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message with the message "We are for it" was installed.
This, however, disturbed the approximately 20 members of the Citizens’ Initiative little in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against ruins".
With this she wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the project of the city will be better for many, although many have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is further delaying these responses, the BI says.
As we heard, the public remarks of the mayor are also affected.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared out for the thermal bath if the population should vote against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some seem scared because of it, others feel it as a "plump blackmail attempt" to the population, the BI's press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick shell for Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg as well, so the sports director of the "Bullen" showed himself disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Swallow kings," he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane in the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese was allegedly deadly acting - which wasn't, however, as the TV pictures showed.
"A sharp misdecision," said Rangnick, referee declaring Harkam "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German countryman: "I would have behaved the same in every situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself doesn’t want to have any contact with his colleague after the shattering with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who's been insulted," the 46-year-old said.
However, in view of the success, Rangnick voted a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: Very good," he said.
There's not much to expose.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
Let it go on.
There will hardly be any changes in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Except for a player who wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court approves Obama's health law
It is a big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the single mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces U.S. citizens to enter into health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts joined the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and also expressed the view that the health law requirement that states should either expand the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The proceedings against the law had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian town gets light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into its dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunfall, the Rjukan in the Westfjord Valley usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters high, a dream of a century came true on Wednesday.
"Endly!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the starting ceremony on TV2.
Some inhabitants of the valley set up sun chairs, others put on safety sunglasses.
So far, sun hungry people had to drive on a cable car to a nearby peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the project costing 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros).
A similar construction has been giving the Italian Alpine village of Viganella winter sunshine for several years.
Post hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still located at various mailboxes in the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find that the emptying is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP said.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only in front of the postal building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten will be emptied on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP’s question.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday emptying is an important post service especially at schedule post.
“Despite the price increase for letters in January 2013, this undertaking is radically and unreasonably thin.”
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberals Group and City Union, supports his counterparts: "What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times here are secretly changed or also deleted."
The post office is a mile away from the public.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays," say Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament if the city administration was planning discussions with the post office on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
However, to his knowledge, there is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
The party is in favour of privatizations.
“Then decisions will be made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt’s parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city magistrate this morning advises on a presentation by traffic department Stefan Majer (Green).
Accordingly, the parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
For this, however, the prices are not to be raised, but the time interval of parking clock and parking tickets machines is to be shortened from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will have to decide.
The retail committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly before the shop is "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller dealers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "too appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Quick actions overwhelm hosts
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb.
The elders were with an experienced team on the other side of the web.
Soon, however, it turned out that, even due to age, they could not fully keep up with the quick actions of the joy cities.
With the hard and placed overheads, the Gönningers became extremely heavy.
Repeatedly they missed the passports and attacks cleared by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the center of the grid and were not in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all matters.
Given this depressing and play-determining performance, the third set was gained a bit lazy and unlustful at the 3:0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, TV Baiersbronn, who was able to clearly stand up in Nagold, will be a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other.
They delivered a heavily competitive two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused mistakes and point gifts, even in the passports, the precision was sometimes lacking and in some critical game scenes, the over-earth prevented the view for possible point gains.
In this highly balanced encounter, however, Marcus Blasutto’s TSV team consistently voted the great physical involvement and pleasant engagement of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
On the fifth day of care in the aftermath of the Natura 2000 project, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cabin in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, on that day the view into the valley should be cut off in the area of the hut, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers described this area as the splendid piece of the gorge, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to collaborate and stressed that the care day was a suitable tool to strengthen the connection between humanity and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time with the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government Presidency of Freiburg explained this ecological aspect following the greeting by Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the foresight corresponds with the aim of maintaining the now strongly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grass hoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for the preservation of the species.
Tribukait said she did not want to fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous addition to what the Life project has achieved for the future as well as the previous care days.
After these various performances, the resort manager Christoph Wehle and the life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been cut in advance, the forest tractor is ready if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of walnut bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the open view at the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstadt Löffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own urban works, no second mayor candidate has yet registered.
The only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, the 46-year-old banking businessman and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, on Thursday enforced an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against cell phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was overtaken by him in Nortel’s insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei, and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is shared owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents involve technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which thus meets the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in strong competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times, offering last $4.4 billion.
After overtaking Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s patent library.
“Although Google failed to attempt to acquire the patents at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so.”
Rockstar demands high damages from Google as it claims that Google’s patent infringement is deliberate, the accusation said.
Egypt vows first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi has made his oath, but his day of triumph is not likely to mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president and thus succeeded Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He swore in front of the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, which is seated on the Nile and resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at the ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been mostly targeted as a prohibited organization by the respective government since its foundation 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o’clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in front of the court to commend the new president, and unlike the presidential prunk from the Mubarak period, traffic was stopped only for a brief period so that the car convoy could cross the normally busy road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who wanted to bring to an end the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mursi, wearing a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wooden chamber where he swore.
Later, Mursi drove to the University of Cairo, where he was to hold his opening speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel playing the national anthem that he listened to in respect.
The military commander Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the University's largest auditorium with vocals of "The Army and the People are a Hand".
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi on Friday made a symbolic oath on Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken from the chased head of state.
But by placing the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech at Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discotheque ensures two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberger Disco "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday night it's called "Pump this party", on tomorrow Saturday night it's going on with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed from ladder: severely injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and wounded himself severely.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outer facade of a guesthouse.
As he climbed the ladder, which stood on the roof canal, that way slipped and the man fell onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the Salzburg State Hospital.
Rape in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice a life sentence on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana was found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The incident had triggered horror nationwide.
The then 21-year-old raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial premises in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for the victim’s survival for 14 hours, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so terrifying that nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
During the trial, Kana admitted to having been in a bar with booys in the night.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
Police initially started by several perpetrators, but released two suspects from detention because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecutor’s office also stressed during the proceedings that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost everyday in South Africa: there are about 64,000 allegations of sexual violence every year.
This is almost ten times more than in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark figure in sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The spokesman makes it clear at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the pig chickens, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham that you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains how the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat he comes into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo must also disinfect his hands before he can grab the microphone.
Jumbo seen for strengthening at quick snack in Waldshut
“Here I am being worked in heavy amounts,” the television makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product, astonished.
16,000 cups a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered at the age of six months.
TV at a level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH value.
“I’m looking forward to seeing Roberto Blanco what’s going on,” said Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is still worthwhile.
The spectator sees that breaking down the keels continues to be handmade.
Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the mixture of spices with salt.
Smoke tower and smoke burning remind Jumbo visually of a "submarine".
The trick: Pine branches here in smoke provide the special taste of Black Forest ham.
Twenty days in smoke makes the ham almost black.
“Now the disc is disappearing in the jumbo,” he announces the test feeding.
“It’s really delicious,” says the TV star.
This will allow everyone involved to live.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual earnings before taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, it means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner announced that Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and a strong start to the second half of the year, particularly in the Australian and British private business.
“Our ten countries have been profitable since the beginning of the year and some of them are on a good path towards record yearly revenues from interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earners.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, balancing a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it went well for the recreational business of Flight Centre in the UK, while business customers spent less.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half-year, so a profit is expected for the third year in a row for the entire year.
Flight Centre’s shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes "unseen texts" in order to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to take an independent GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core courses will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisory authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public trust,” emphasizing that the GCSEs would become “more challenging, more ambitious and more strict.”
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, from coalition circles it is said that the comprehensive mathematical examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will likely encourage schools to spend more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from the real life", including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours will be shown this weekend at the City Hall.
The evaluations were already made on Thursday.
Once again, the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the Soest district show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobby owners their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges gave the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The Rabbit Show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 to 3:30 p.m.
Guests are also invited to a highly priced Tombola and a delicious cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Conversation Forum
At the next Ecumenical Conversation Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, the theme is "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on today's dealing with the last things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches in Salem, the Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of the Lake Constance.
Johanna Rahner wants to examine in the forum of the question, how today people rank the "last things" after death.
If people in the past centuries had known too much about it, putting it on those images of heaven and hell, "which shape our ideas to this day," then the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion would rather be characterized by some embarrassment or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope is that Christians have been expelled by religious criticism,” she said.
"She gave us so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death."
This is linked to the question of that longing, "who dreams that in the end everything will be good."
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She graduated with Dr. theol., also in Freiburg in 1997.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleine Heuberg reaffirm their faithfulness
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-olds of the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been signed.
The Laudato-Si group accompanied the service in the morning, the afternoon of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, the firms had prepared themselves for the big holiday, under the leadership of the deacon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of numerous church members.
In different projects, they learned about various tasks of Christian community life and jointly experienced the Youth Day in Subpowertal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthusiasts participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to deal with the round course over the hills around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, there were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in the competition atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places in the German championships.
They were able to leave the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the goal and defended his title as the overall short-distance winner.
Once again, Pascal Treubel was placed in second place.
With the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli of the team Nightmare who managed to achieve the top of the winning staircase.
In place 2 and 3 came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Fahrer from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the growing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year, there were even more absolute Topathlets at the start.
Four drivers were able to separate themselves from the top regional drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-professional from the Black Tusk racing team.
Pangerl and a teammate have already been world champions in twelve-hour driving twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already mentions two German championship titles in duathlon, is his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a final eyelashes in the target run in front of the Three-Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Only a second after that, the Routine Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall score.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann reached the target as third of the overall rating.
In the women's rankings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place from Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and assistants were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
En route through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year."
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain and caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment she had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle said.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, in the United States, the ratio is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not afford to visit them.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffering in Bwelle made the decision mature to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced into minibuses and drive to the villages in need of help with the laced medical equipment on the roof.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
They had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud more than once.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed as heroes: a feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a reason to celebrate, and with its wide smile and boundless energy, it is happy to participate in the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins with the examination of hundreds of patients.
“Per ride we treat 500 people,” says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crickets, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school but many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anaesthetic.
The surgery usually takes place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the operation and disinfection equipment is fed by the group’s generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning hours.
It’s an exhausting pensum, but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference for the people they help.
One man explained that the free operation of a bowel rupture he had received now allowed him to return to work.
“It changes the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to his weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s asleep,” says Katie O’Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and volunteering at Bwelles Group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“We can be there in surgeries where we can help clump blood or hold the instruments Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated medical equipment.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guidance.
“He’s without a doubt a hero,” says O’Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries.
For Bwell, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and fulfilling a promise he has given to his father is a great joy for him.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the battle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut off by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his career, the acting art.
No one can deceive the old man Santiago at fishing.
The two complement each other greatly.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman boy Manolo talks.
When Santiago is tired of life sitting on the chair, that’s real at Janson.
Besides, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage in far distances as a single actor.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not a moment boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made up of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, who with her songs and her magnificent voice sings the feeling of Cuba’s life.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, below Cologne, a sewage duct from the Roman era is preserved.
Anyone visiting Cologne will not pass by the Cathedral.
Approximately 157 meters the two towers reach the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who admire the two filigrane church towers know that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly on the cathedral.
The tour begins incredibly unspectacular: “We start in the underground car park,” says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the town fathers wanted a car-right city, and therefore, from the remains of the old town wall, only what was not too large remained.
Therefore, most users of the car park rush past the Roman remnants today and only leave their car.
But whoever looks closer, discovers in Park Deck D2 an archaeological site separated by metal grating rods.
There are about five meters high ruins of handplate-sized stones to be seen.
"They are remnants of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze says.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take a look into a dark 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants go down again to the depths.
Here we see the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in German means as much as "City of Roman Law and City of the Agrippinens, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the pretorium is the former Governor's Palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the opening room of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewage channel, which is maintained here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can quietly walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze encourages the guests.
There is still a surprise for Schulze.
After picking up the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will become part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which construction works are expected to begin soon.
However, there will be a few more years to complete.
Almost cut off the leg: Release of Rocker Process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous bodily injury and property injury against two 30-year-olds has begun in the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the opening.
They were supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecutor's office accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are supposed to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One was said to have been a high-level member from Berlin.
It seemed to have been a persecution with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about resort fights and a power demonstration.
The two accused were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman at the time said it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court lifted the judgment after revision of the prosecutor’s office and referred it to the state court for re-trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open enforcement for another offence.
The beginning was primarily about the reconstruction of the processes during the night.
As a witness, the investigating commissioner was invited.
In the center were cell phone calls of the defendants and others who had been heard by the police.
It’s hard for rockers to almost always follow a brass law in court – rather than testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Attorney Stefan Golfier of the prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last trial.
Another eleven days of negotiation are scheduled for the process.
The Disposable Society Doesn't Think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: in the belly of the people on the passenger and rear seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or another cocktail or vinegar may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than going to the next drive-in to get a little bit?
I admit, I’m happy to be there if you go to fast food late at night or early in the morning.
A few potatoes, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco players become noticeable.
Because what does one have to miss, that one constantly throws his fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends, paper bags are thrown away on roadsides and on parking lots.
“Why?” I wonder.
Are people too dumb to take the bags home or to the next garbage bin?
It’s not just that the paperworks shit the landscape.
Bags have also already covered up transport facilities such as guiding planks and thus triggered accidents.
But not thinking about what this "disposable society" thinks, it probably doesn't even know what this word actually means.
When you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know how a rear seat can look after sweet nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage tower there.
There a few bags would make more or less nothing - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the food remains of others.
I already see the day coming when the towns and municipalities become stupid to clean up - and the fast food chains have to demand bonds for their bags.
Obama's Retreat in Health Policy
After heavy criticism yesterday, President Obama made a retreat on his frequently repeated, clear promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After receiving hundreds of thousands of letters of dismissal from their insurers, the Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can retain it,” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look around in the free market for new insurance.
Most citizens could thus get a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“They come up with a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as not surprising that the five percent of the population who have entered into insurance themselves would have to look around for a different tariff because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I would like to say straightforward to these Americans that they deserve better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at yesterday’s hearing in the House of Representatives was accepted after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri as to whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the Affordable Care Act’s “architect” did not voluntarily waive a state-funded insurance to conclude a tariff on HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on Thursday to CNN that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
The target was "missiles and related equipment" that the Israeli government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arabic broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot in the night of Wednesday to Thursday, and blamed the Israelis for it.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, which showed Russian S-125 Newa defense missiles, as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an anonymous Israeli government official saying he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defense said, “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously, in part successfully, tried to deliver ground-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” followed by a military response.
John Kerry says in an unprecedented acknowledgement that U.S. espionage has “gone too far inappropriately”
John Kerry, with an unexpected acknowledgement, suggested a defence of the US’ defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying that espionage in certain cases has “gone too far unreasonably.”
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching on “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities were made public.
Due to the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of outrage on the part of its allies.
Kerry said, “The president and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have almost expired by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so remained from the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, from September 11th.”
He was the first high-level member of the U.S. government to acknowledge that U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases this has gone too far inappropriately.”
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse occurs here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a power of goodness and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added, “We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves into the air.”
“There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, exploding in the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we learned about such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. on counter-terrorism efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had spoken with representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is very important for U.S. national security interests that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism,” Murphy, who serves as a Democrat in the Senate for the first time and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we have to continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their angry about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have burdened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were incorrect and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures cited from documents passed on by Snowden that the NSA had monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary, declaring that this is common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his authority was preparing the Congress trip to be held this year, hoping that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being prepared.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they have used themselves for years.
“While we can change our monitoring programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with resentment over US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the jump joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away match of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz deployed Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six hits.
The Mainzers have already to give up on the injured leaders Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 for making a false statement after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, shots of a video camera showed that she had safely entered her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she admitted to having invented the story.
Until the trial, she was in police detention on the ground.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player in the Australian Rubgy league, who turned to the foreign ministry in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted to have her back to Australia.
“We are of course very worried, but we hope she’ll be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht on the free foot.
In Australian reports she was on vacation in the meantime at the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of traveller Michelle Smith in Phuket, might be trying to improve its distressed tourist image, and that’s why it comes to an excuse.
