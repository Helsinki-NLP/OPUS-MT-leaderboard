Spectacular jump in "wingsuit" over Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped on Thursday from a helicopter over the Colombian capital, Bogota.
Equipped with a wing suit (a combination with wings), it went to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many badauds had gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling to find the money needed to repair the downhill highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that sits above your car’s dashboard.
The aircraft, which record all the miles traveled by a driver and pass on information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to reform the outdated system of funding major U.S. roads.
The generally uninterested sector of major axis planning has suddenly sparked heavy debate and hectic alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you’re traveling, and possibly the road you’re traveling on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about privacy protection.
And while members of Congress can't agree on whether to continue, several states haven't waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of drivers have already embarked on these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental trip.
This is truly indispensable for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will begin recording the miles traveled by each Californian driver by 2025.
There will be change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do this.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with the taxes Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans are no longer buying as much gasoline as before.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by one cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The fuel tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
“This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces urban liberals, as taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set in the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
But Representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa), Chairman of the House Transport Committee, said he also regarded it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation’s supporters of the free market also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay for the mile.
“It’s not just a tax going into a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the mile payment path.
The U.S. Senate approved a pilot project of $90 million last year that allegedly covered about 10,000 cars.
But the chairman of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to go to their work or to the city.
However, several states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to carry out the country's most important experience.
These drivers will soon pay the state kilometer fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois tries a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which comprises 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer drivers have recently equipped their cars with an aircraft, drivers were worried that the government could follow their slightest actions and actions.
“The concerns about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who leads strategic performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
At the beginning of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged location devices.”
There is no need to build a huge and bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily coming and runways.
Nevada is one of the few states now working to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car is traveling, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
Research on this technology led some state agencies to call on a small California start-up named True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists paying taxes to states.
She sought to penetrate the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices it tests have liked large-axis planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Serious mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less expensive ways and much less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have an appliance at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport officials are looking to develop a taxation system that would also be equipped to pay parking fees, provide “payment at driving” insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Autors would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits that the system offers them,” said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on mile payment is not just a huge diversion.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
A single or additional annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much gasoline, so each one pays his fair share.
“It’s not necessary to resort to radical surgery when you simply need aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, Director of Legislation and Public Affairs at the Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about protecting their privacy and a bunch of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unreleased Listen
The English musician hasn’t finished surprised this year.
Starting with The Next Day, released in January, he concocted a luxury re-edition scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone in a row.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he said a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dated 2003) and too rare public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be relied on to make the pop scene shimmer.
A feast for its fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one round in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to re-release this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he made a real feast for his fans.
This re-edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three records: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four previously released clips.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks from the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both the discs, but also the accessories supplied with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new Atomica track, typically in The Next Day’s vein, with very forward guitars and a skillfully mastered rock electricity.
Unprecedented news already on listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-faced: a worrying intro before a luminous cavalcade that gradually slows down to leave room for a pop ballad.
Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The enchanting guitar riffs make you want to leave the Earth.
Bowie has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: informant turn-to-turn, man aboard a rocket, Martian potential...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, especially with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign L'Invitation à Voyage, of the brand Louis Vuitton, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not summarily freed from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before they return to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and Neo-Democrats in the House of Commons, Nicholson assured that before their release, members of the army would follow a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers are given appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the military "universal service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army despite his request to stay an additional year in order to receive fully indexed retirement.
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who stated before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not meet the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to determine what latitude it can grant to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but are not ready to fight.
Under current rules, severely injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the duration of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal spokesman Jim Karygiannis on Wednesday called for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins, while Neo-Democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice."
Disney sets on tablets to launch an animated series
The U.S. media and entertainment group Disney has decided to privilege tablets to its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its phone and tablet app.
Its global launch on the Disney group's channels is only scheduled for 2014, detailed the statement from its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children aged 2 to 7 years, tells the adventures of Pussy Callie, sheriff of a town in the west of America where she makes order rule with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today,” said Albert Cheng, Vice President of Digital Products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This kind of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are becoming increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 years of age have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US surveillance issue
U.S. intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he enjoys the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin Friday, Snowden said: “Although the outcome of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Snowden wrote that he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon the criminal charges held against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will make it possible.”
The U.S.-German relations have been put to the test following complaints that the NSA had stopped listening to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Snowden as a witness “without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States,” it should be taken advantage of.
Mr. Ströbele, a German Green MP, posted a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to former NSA consultant’s lawyer, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he should be assured that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been the subject of a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including the United States – considered the disclosure of an unexplained system of permanent surveillance to be of public use.
The letter introduces an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers could well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video on demand service via their TV in a future that doesn’t seem so far away.
The Cogeco subsidiary said on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces and more options," Cogeco Chairman and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus takes the step of its competitors, like Bell, even though the Cogeco subsidiary has not yet given a precise date with regard to this new platform.
“We must adapt and change or resist change and fail,” Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not have access to right now.
Telecommunications giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service is said to be in discussions with some major cable providers so that its service is available via their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his speech at the Throne on October 16th.
Ottawa aims to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for services on-the-card.
"It's been about two and a half years since we've been saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy major channel packages doesn't work," Audet said.
However, he hoped that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy regarding television," Cogeco said.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and they are expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 <0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decline compared to net profit of 44.9 million, or 83 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, from the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline by depreciation costs linked to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based Atlantic Broadband cable for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for 526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they saw a 41.5% growth in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
This amounts to 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93 <0xC2><0xA2> per share, in the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable’s revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of customers of Cogeco Cable increased 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about the number of customers fluctuating like this.
For me, this is not an indication of a trend change, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
From horse to beef products
Horse meat has been detected in canned boxes of beef products, sold by two small British low-cost distributors, the food hygiene agency announced today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, manufactured in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained 1 to 5% horse DNA.
"As horse meat is not listed on the ingredients list, it should not have been in the product," the British agency said.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, as a result of tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles caused four injuries, early Friday, on road 131, in Lanaudière.
Just before 4 a.m., a driver who was driving north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and struck a car arriving in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid for their lives.
Traffic returned to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 to passengers carrying hand luggage on their flights.
Frontier Airlines is planning to start paying up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could carry the unopened can with them at the plane’s descent.
New hand luggage fees are for bags in the upper compartment, so small bags under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would pay $25 if the fee was paid in advance and $100 if travellers only pay once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to have that price paid,” she explained.
The airlines began paying for the first and second baggage checked in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as much as they could in hand luggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no space in those compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said these new fees won't really be used to raise money.
It is about making the most loyal clients of Frontier understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger tailing at a Frontier boarding door could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these fees before arriving at the door.
Frontier hand luggage fees will not be charged before the summer, although no date has been fixed.
Passengers often bump about luggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are high and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people on Wall Street view the addition of luggage fees as a sign that airlines are paying enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, many of them have not affected the baggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand luggage fee three years ago, and the low-cost airline Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other airline imposing such fees is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said the consultant with airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the fees in addition.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit's hand luggage fee was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former executive of Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers would discover the airline's unusual hand luggage fees.
“I’ve never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I was expecting to see teeth scratching and a fight breaking out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “the passengers got on board at the speed of the flash.”
Frontier also does as Spirit and charges $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier said that passengers who drink a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who drink coffee can be served free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after passengers complained and while no other major airline had followed.
Frontier’s decision to charge a hand luggage fee when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, she started offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who purchased their ticket through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced miles bonuses by 25% on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would gain 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly from the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown, Denver, but her business declines and she loses money.
Revenues fell 9% and its flight capacity fell nearly 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results published Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to rectify Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA challenges an “internal error” and not hackers for failing its website
The National Security Agency, working in the shadow, said Friday it was a bug that caused its public site to fail for a few hours, not hackers as some claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been crashed for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics are not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The formerly ultra-secret NSA, once nicknamed the “No Such Agency,” has been under the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and overseas communications monitoring programs – which are part of the NSA secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former abused NSA consultant.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked a lot of speculation that tonight’s incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta City Centre is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors in Montreal on Thursday after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have yet to find a new job.
Delta promises not to drop its employees.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and individual employees were met to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” said Delta Hotels Regional Director of Labour Relations, Félix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta takes place in a highly competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
“Either he sold it to someone else, and that’s what happened,” says Paul Arsenault, who holds the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Science Management.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for seniors.
Meanwhile, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be launched in two years.
Titan CEO: “Goodyear Amiens’ purchasing project starts with zero employees”
After throwing the sponge in January for the partial resumption of the promised Goodyear site in Amiens-North at the closure, Maurice Taylor, CEO of U.S. pneumatic engineer Titan, declares himself, today, ready to save 333 of the 1,137 jobs the factory has.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, announced this on Monday.
After giving up on the plan to purchase the factory in January, you are coming back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, talking about "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, "foolish" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this turning-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the highest paid.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day while working eight hours in other countries is disabled in France.
In India, China and many other countries, ten to twelve hours a day are worked.
I have no prejudice about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan does not need to buy this factory.
But, with a correct price and skilled workers, it is worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the factory, Goodyear had offered employees a good starting compensation, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
Thus, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
Now, he wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from Goodyear’s 1,200 current employees.
Therefore, Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that CGT and Goodyear seal an agreement on departure allowances for all employees.
There will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were willing to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he would want a four-year warranty.
But, as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the plan to purchase the factory starts with zero employees.
How can we give warranties of employment time when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg manages to have CGT and Goodyear agree and Titan buy the factory, we are planning to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier’s profit decreases, as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aeronautical and railway manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower aircraft orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for its brand-new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious timetable for commercial commissioning by September.
After the first flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it only flew three times, and then the question was whether the test phase was on track.
Results were unsatisfied and the stock price decreased by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from “overperformance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential for stock market rise in the next quarter or two next quarters.
“Although the decline in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed with the profit margin in the Transportation division,” Doerksen said in a customer note.
We believe that Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest at 177. It appears that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new aircraft.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its 300 firm orders goal before the first aircraft will be commercially commissioned.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was progressing in accordance with the schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the plane’s downtime.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to proceed with a first flight and schedule an update period, and that's what we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow soon after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the fact that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the schedule for entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slow flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be postponed in the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists have been carried missing in a pit under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday evening, it was learned Friday from the Spéléo de rescue de l'Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one struggling with practice and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday at around 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the town of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We haven’t heard from them since then, the same source said.
"Speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, a technical adviser to the Speleo Relief in charge of the organization of the rescue.
Dozens of people on site
Around twenty rescuers, ten civilian members of the French Speleo relief, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon on Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It's another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, transmitted the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," Le Dauphiné explains.
The two soldiers at the 13th battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry were found "exhausted but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, returned to their footsteps waiting for rescue, the prefecture said.
When fed, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists union on Thursday invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo’s online services in the aftermath of new disclosures about U.S. and British intelligence services’ activities.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid until further orders to use Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging," she said in a statement.
She finds the Washington Post report “scandalous,” according to which the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two companies to synchronize their servers.
“The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them,” said Michael Konken, president of the union claiming 38,000 members.
Repainted fires: Member calls for Brigitte Grouwels to resign
Minister Brigitte Grouwels' project of "relifting" the posts of the signal lights in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched on Thursday in central Brussels a test project consisting of painting 16 posts of signal lights of the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both to "increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to paint all the Brussels signal lights, for an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark," according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"It is not content with insanely spending the money of the Brusselses in operations of relifting the colours of the Brussels region, Brigitte Grouwels continues its operations of flamandization of the capital," De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted herself in dark-blue-black the Brussels poles.
According to the MP, "there is no more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselses deserve better than seeing their money wasted by a CD&V minister who is carrying out the NVA program herself.
It is time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"Brigitte Grouwels was elected only with 2,245 votes or 0.5% of the Brusselses!" concludes De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis dismantled
The ecotax port of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent protest of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on the spot shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national was diverted in the wake.
The dismantling decision, announced by the Prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
It is the last of the three ecotax ports operating in the department of Finistère, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of a Google Glass Accessories Store
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers owning a prototype of Google signed smart glasses.
They can thus acquire a headphone, a charger or a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of microfibers or an intra-ear earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father had deleted himself from the world of the living.
In the beginning I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn’t know how I was going to continue to “frequent it.”
There is no recipe, no manual for passing through the wall of the invisible and finding his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a sweet wake-up call in the middle of the night to watch his watch that never leaves me, lying on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my everyday gestures.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found his body empty, cracked on that hospital bed with crippled linens.
Similarly, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the thin glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, through small day or night appearances, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that thought to be mourning.
And then she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person at all, but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
As this woman died, she had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and behold, I found her full and complete.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and out," he seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had tough relationships with him until he became old, sick.
I was no longer afraid of him and could love him.
One day he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was scared, when I had a pain...
He spoke to me, encouraged me constantly, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I borrowed my body to him.
But it was never indiscrete.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It took a long time, then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don’t know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer there, but I always feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night, but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always one thing that prevents me from achieving that moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes some dreams carry me on the contrary and fit into my story and indeed they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound when I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed I was waking up, I was rising out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the bearing and he smiled at me and rejoiced that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he shared with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I loved sharing this moment with him and I am pleased to tell you this common memory lived after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother was dying of cancer.
A year ago, she was on a trip with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused to the young bachelor I was at the time.
I realized my grief quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I am in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interesting me in the Middle East, to the point of doing a master's degree in a large school, have not been, with the backwards, an unusual choice.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would want me to act at some point.
The same applies to my attitudes: I try to keep up with the generosity and righteousness of the woman who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes lay on me.
My mother died 19 years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that triggers themselves alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time calmed the pain.
There remained only the lack, this unanswered void, this need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me in the hollow of her sweetness.
Yet she is there, silent presence, she is there and looks at me.
Every morning I see his worried eyes lay on me, I see the circles that heighten his gaze, the thin lines around the lips that dig the cigarettes, the folds that mark the forehead on the days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so little by little we learned to smile, and pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I speak to her in the hole of the night when the absence hurts too much, it gets into my dreams when the morale is a little bit hit.
We feel worn and protected in the difficult times, the retreat of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay in the way she had traced us.
If a being has loved you very strongly, the absence cannot pull it from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or liked.
I was unable to attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his view of things.
I also had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep and I always wonder what he'll think about it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
It was soon thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and my son 6 years old.
The immense grief that invaded me then, of course, was alleviated, but it is always close to me.
Very often he "disembarks" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even more sad to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he answered me "I'm coming down" but with such a real voice that I woke up up in anxiety and turned on the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that he was coming.
I still live in the same house, and often I feel observed and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In every room I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would never leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a responsibility profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am grandmother, I have lots of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures on Friday: 964 people died last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We don’t tell the world to be by our side and support each other, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it,” Al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will expand, too.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the U.S. Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They stamped signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and urging the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
Cocainoman lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to a three-year imprisonment sentence by the Liverpool Seat Court
A senior defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of an important police investigation because he feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was giving sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after committing compromise because of his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed “Bash” and considered by the criminals as a “primary case,” was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial related to drug trafficking.
Police officials spotted Sarborough, 32, depositing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a Bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought illegally to obtain information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were then under police surveillance as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, as well as more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be revealed.
Today, at the Liverpool seat court, Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, fell into disgrace after being convicted on two charges of impediment to justice after a three-week trial.
He admitted to possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had regularly been in phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, pure to 60%, under the lawyer's trash bins in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in phone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer returned home, discovered the drugs and they phoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied consuming cocaine, saying that he spoke to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a “legal privilege.”
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients sometimes call him home for legal issues.
But the court heard testimony that he called major actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, “If someone needs to know that they should not violate the law, they are a criminal attorney.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He hindered the police investigation as much as he could to allow it to continue its criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor her profession, but dishonored her.
He came too close to some clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t have waited 3 p.m., I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said, “Mr. Ditta turned from criminal lawyer to criminal himself since he started procuring drugs from criminal organizations.”
His cocaine addiction compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the backgrounds of leaders of organized criminal groups who charged him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should adhere to the strictest integrity rules and create a climate of public trust.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to shelter behind the varnish of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three heads of allegations of cocaine possession and now of impediment to justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals so that they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty of complicity in trafficking heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question/answer session about himself in which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death hallway in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will return to the stage in December
The Detroit News newspaper reports that the Queen of the Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board room at the MotorCity Casino hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering, the famous interpreter of Respect told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she’s “happy to be back.”
Chin reduces the cost of its Christmas lighting
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a coat of light: one could close the heat in Menton with the bill of illumination.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is also paid by taxpayers, not by merchant associations.
To reduce costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two were injured.
It would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the shooter.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff have rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Very soon police forces intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was arrested on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical song for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five scenes imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to embrace the classical song.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyric Art of the Kingdom will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that now makes room filled at the Pulperie of Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving local artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apéro lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the soprano colorature Marie-Eve Munger.
This was a benefit activity, in parallel with the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of the bat.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well shaped, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are on the fly and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operette, a step we will take in seven years," the administrator said.
“I’d say even beyond,” said CEO Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been accused of taking hostages, kidnapping, threatening, weapons wearing for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failure to comply with an order.
“The rapid reactions of the police involved and their ability to immediately deactivate the situation were essential to the security conclusion of this incident,” Corporal Bert Paquet said in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will be due to appear in court on Friday.
New request for collective appeal against the Sainte-Croix Brothers
A new request for collective appeal was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that would have occurred this time at the St. Joseph's Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his professor Brother Soumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the oratory Saint Joseph, where he was serving as a Mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was only about three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us, "I was in such a place, can I register?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed is to allow the addition of complainants from any establishment where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
Currently, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal further emphasizes that the congregation of Saint-Croix and the oratory of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "let sexual abuse be perpetrated against children", that they "exerced moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", that they "were aware of sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless suffered".
These latter charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix Brothers, Mr. Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the searches made in the archives about this by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The collective appeal must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once the admissibility has been admitted by the Court, the second stage, i.e. the substantive hearings, is conducted.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle amicably before hearings were conducted on the substance.
Serious fire in a shop
A fire severely damaged a shop in the Montreal district of LaSalle in the night of Thursday to Friday.
Rescues were called around 1 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cuisine restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took nearly an hour to master the fire.
The fire "caused serious damage to the building's structure," said the head of the Montreal Fire Safety Service operations, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty houses, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested because residents of one of the apartments may need to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM said.
Many opposition to medical aid to die in palliative care Congress
The Canadian Congress on Palliative Care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would like to end their lives, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If palliative care was focused in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical aid to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is worried about the consequences for the next generations.
“What is the meaning of life,” she deplores.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to Alliance Vice President of Palliative Care Homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Mathieu-Froment-Savoie house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill disorients the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't believe Ontario will take the step.
For her part, Gatineau Liberal MP, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the notion of end of life will need to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press is outraged at controversial media law
“It’s a frightening country and it’s legitimate to ask ourselves the question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judiciary system tomorrow?” the newspaper said in contesting the bill and asking it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we refuse it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites in Kenya.
He said the new media court "will always be partial because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have “media control,” while The Standard indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya “have been hit hard” and has hit the bill calling it “draconian.”
The bill was passed in conjunction with a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists at Westgate Mall last September.
Kenyan media has sparked anger by authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed to the scene of the attack allegedly stole the luxury mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the call was withdrawn following a shield lift in the media.
Under the new bill, media may be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “dismissed” or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By silentizing the media, politicians know they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” reporter Mutuma Mathiu wrote to The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“When delivered to themselves, politicians would put the country in bankruptcy and bring us back to hunting and harvesting.”
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of the anger of the population in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wage Commission and restored their mirroring wages of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-exempt – which are among the highest in the world.
A tough year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists from the Centre de Santé et Services Socials (CSSS) in Laval caused a whole shock to the management of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Santé, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leaves or short leaves, the pharmacy department found itself highly deficient in staff.
Nearly 30% of the needed staff was missing, making this financial year “very difficult,” according to department chief Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire independent workers, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
We did not use troubleshooting, Ms. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or decreased to be leveled, as long as things get back.
Of course we have worked hard to interest our young people [residents in pharmacy] in coming and staying here.
There's a competition of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is clearly easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in the past few months.
Furthermore, the efforts of the department to retain have been fruitful, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain in the CSSS.
Now it’s going much better, the pharmacist said.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
Always Growing Needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in hospitals or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is still precarious, because we have a environment that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always ride to three maternity leaves when it's okay, she added.
The last year, we had a lot more and we didn't have pharmacists that are available to make replacements, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old top model doesn’t start his career in the cinema by the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This egregious pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a 40-year-old sex addict since her teenagehood.
The resemblance of Stacy Martin with her eldest is striking: a silhouette of branch, a diaphanous dye and French-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to put naked on icy paper will appear in much more sulfurous situations on a large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac has raised the temperature on the web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their humility in the closet, he resorted to X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing his actresses into their last retreats, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
Narbonne CGR room evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, as a result of tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility proceeded to evacuate the room and warned the firefighters of a suspicious smell.
Approximately 70 people left the session.
The people were examined and full recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke on tear jet background?
Or an involuntary incident?
Still, the cinema management has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was airy and everything went in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers were able to regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween, a woman tried to bring two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins into the country Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the checking of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine had been divided into three pumpkins that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie Office (RCMP) which took over in the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not disclose where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, CBSA spokeswoman Jacqueline Roby said.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, a total of 1653 seizures of narcotics were carried out by Quebec border officers.
Aerial raid on military facilities in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace early on Wednesday afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of short-range ground-to-air missiles SA-8 was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place under circumstances roughly identical to that of July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting the Yakhont land-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation of seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The rating agency Standard & Poor's on Friday lowered Ukraine's credit rating, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
“It is less and less likely that the government’s strategy will secure enough foreign currency to meet its high foreign funding needs,” the agency said.
The agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and forecasts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reservations, which the authorities use massively to support the collapsing local currency, the agency considers increasingly likely to be a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs cash to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not having paid an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of heavy tensions with its Russian neighbor, angry at Kiev’s willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with a budget deficit, has been demanding for months the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which had granted it a loan of $15.3 billion in 2010 and has so far unlocked only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF found this week that "important needs for external financing" constituted "a vulnerability", while raised "signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, “a short-term improvement cannot be expected.”
“There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year,” the presidential elections are planned in 2015, the expert told AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international economy.
S&P further notes the "uncertainty" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions on the release of opponent Yulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," said S&P, who fears "trade restrictions" on the part of Moscow.
Russia, which represents a quarter of Ukrainian exports, has warned that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
U.S. Green Light at Publicis-Omnicom Merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday they had received no objections from the U.S. authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
“Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiry of the previously announced review deadline for the merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, envisaged by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended,” the two groups said in a statement.
They said they also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the examination period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions meet several of the conditions necessary to carry out the transaction.
"The merger is also conditional on the obtaining of other regulatory authorizations and the approval of the shareholders of both groups," they added.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would pursue M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be beaten after being driven from localities in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that it controlled since the insurgency began 20 months ago.
“We’re going to pursue the M23 and put it wherever it hides because it’s criminals,” FARDC spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli told Reuters.
We should not allow them to reorganize themselves because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
It is time to bring peace back.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, a political leader in the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands at peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Hangings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to have fallen this week, as well as in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital city of the North Kivu province, taking advantage of the escape of the government garrison and the passivity of the blue helmets of the Monusco.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of staff, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid response brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was redesigned and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of growth of government troops is unprecedented today.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," Congo business expert Jason Stearns predicts on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic – it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has managed to beat a major insurrection.
It would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed groups allied with Rwanda were present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda of military support for the M23, which was formed by former Congolese military mutiny.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a Foreign Office spokesman said.
Last week, Kigali spoke of the possibility of military retaliation following the shells fallen on Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the town to salute the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us one day be released by the army," a resident of this neighboring Uganda town witnesses.
"We lived in terror (from the M23), we are traumatized," he said.
The Pasteur Institute’s tests on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus turned out to be negative, the Ministry of Health said.
The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two cases confirmed in France so far.
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old was suspected to have been affected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already caused about 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second U.S. oil company, reported on Friday a decline in its quarterly earnings due to lower refining margins, while its oil and gas output increased while remaining behind the group's targets.
Net earnings for the third quarter fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Reuters estimated on average a profit per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpd produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpd for this year, with a 25% growth in expected production by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Earnings from production activities declined slightly in the third quarter, while earnings from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) declined from 45% to $380 million.
This decrease in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil, said on Thursday it had a decreasing net profit, despite the rise in its gas and oil production.
Student transport: the complaint deemed admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Sherbrooke Region School Commission (CSRS) requires a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students benefiting from two-home school transportation, a service that the organization provides when it is able to do so.
Prior to the last budget changes, no financial contribution was requested.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," says Lefèvre.
She said the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested additional time to consider.
“It’s always better to talk about it, to talk about it and to find solutions,” says Lefèvre.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergencies of the Hotel-Dieu
In the face of the frond led for several months by a part of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, on 10 July, had decided to "decalate the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of emergencies that will not be able to occur on 4 November."
A request made officially "to run no risk on taking care of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but which also aimed not to interfere with the PS campaign within a few months of the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective at that date.
Even if, in the APHP, the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of November 4, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual passages to the Hotel-Dieu emergencies will all have received the order to take thirty serious cases a day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, Emergency Interns will leave room for five General Medicine Interns on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The Emergency Reception Service of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4," said Loïc Capron, President of the Medical Commission of Establishment (CME) of the APHP, who supports the project of the management.
“On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means,” confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he tempered, arguing for the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency physicians will remain on the spot, he also assures.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are doing gradually," replies Nicolas Péju, spokesman of the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or they lied to her," said Gérald Kierzek.
Resigned from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the frond against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "alert launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "the medical-administrative technology structure".
“They are emptying and asphyxiating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
“If the other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem.”
They are regularly engorged.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting at the Lariboisière emergencies.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" at several sites are not at risk of representing an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
In both the ARS and the APHP, the "new hospital model" is being defended since October 7, which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, Liberal general physicians are also expected to participate in the establishment of an "outpatient care permanence".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnose," asks Gérald Kierzek for whom "the concept of emergency not serious" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will happen as with level 3 maternity schools.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take any measures by Monday, we will change bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency physician and a member of the CGT Health.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP adviser of Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announced that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to responsibility".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, recalled Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would not be a closure on November 4.
If so, she would mark her clear disagreement, her spokesman Bruno Julliard said.
Even though the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the background, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama ends listening to IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to take over the NSA's listening case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the IMF and World Bank surveillance by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal.
Asked about the issue, a U.S. administration official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance against the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been established in the past.
Another official said Barack Obama had given orders to cease these practices over the past few weeks.
This was given roughly at the same time as that which ended the hearings of the UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission on Thursday approved an increased control over government monitoring programs but authorized their continued operation.
The commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are authorized to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the retention of this information.
UN welcomes new poverty reduction goals
The United Nations is now working on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development that began the previous day in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and appropriate the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress under the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfill the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Security concern in Mozambique grows as conflicts erupt among powerful figures
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scandal peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she swapped her work clothes for a shirt with the words “we want safety” in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital’s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been reports of conflict between government forces and the Renamo, the worst hangs since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by Rhodesia ruled by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country shouldn’t go back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is significant for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other responsibility for tensions.
The Renamo states that the government is responsible for the recent clashes and that it has launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of the Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesman for the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The government holds the Renamo responsible for triggering the conflicts, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama regarded himself as a “loser” who wanted to use “all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.”
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said that the Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant the deal was no longer respected by Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease the tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are constantly fighting,” explained Joseph Hanlon, an open university speaker and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate well, and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes collected by the Renamo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to get more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who is expected to withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the hangings took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if the Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has reinforced the government's frustrations, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country’s future, and that it is up to the latter to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said people only want stability.
“Nobody cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “lifestyle patterns,” the author says.
Thor's Legend might show that "brutal force does not hold the weight to subtle trick," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “too violent, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene to be taught in school,” Crossley-Holland advocated a “minded selection” of works adapted to age.
“I find it great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes children “completely catch up,” the messages being “sublimated” into pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said, “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer for adults and an adult writer for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything needs to be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than stated.
The known basis of what is shown and not said.
A fighter from the Hamas armed branch was killed tonight and another injured by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have learned.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border zone between Palestinian territory and Israel when they shot a shell from an Israeli armored tank.
NSA espionage: U.S. has "gone too far," admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in espionage, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged, in Washington's first confession in full controversy with Europe about massive data collection by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, disclosures and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA’s interception of communications and data in Europe.
“In some cases, I concede to you, as the president has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this will not happen in the future,” Kerry said at a conference in London at which he was attending from Washington on Thursday.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of U.S. diplomacy has long justified intelligence and information gathering practices through the necessary counter-terrorism fight and prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of September 11, 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the U.S. authorities had since defeated many bombing projects, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
“We have actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects in advance,” he said.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been deceived in this process."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," the Secretary of State admitted, who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said on Thursday night that President Obama was “resolved to try to clarify and that he was reviewing these practices so that no one would feel wrong.”
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of users of Google and Yahoo.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, says the program called "MUSCULAR", and led with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows the two agencies to retrieve data from the optical fibers used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on emails, text items, or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link to these practices.
Over the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from U.S. allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and as leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. president was not aware of such listening, Barack Obama refused to speak on this, invoking national security.
On the other hand, the head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that its intelligence agency has captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even returned the bullet to the European intelligence agencies that would have seized these communications, before delivering them to the NSA.
This would concern “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and would absolutely not target Europe, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of an extensive international espionage network that has also sparked China's anger.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master asset, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the club of Ligue 1 announced in a statement.
PSG, the leader of the championship against Monaco unlike goals, has circulated the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old attacker.
The statement simply states that he is "bleached", without specifying the nature of the injury.
Nevertheless, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the crematized deceased
The Crematorium of Père Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris town hall, is expected to attend, and will then explain, at a press conference, her proposals on funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funeral, more and more French choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7 with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For a loved one’s funeral, it’s the opposite: French people prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book The Ash Death, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Committee on Funeral Ethics, emphasizes the "violence" that cremation constitutes for the survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of grief".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which stems from the "deletion of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of ashes.
Why is what is easily accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still badly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," replies Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Approach Death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to embrace it.
For François Michaud-Nérard, director general of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, it is to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with a burial.
The Ipsos annual survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists and non-believers want it too.
The crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
“For a decade, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the surrender of ashes,” said Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now propose masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: hosting the assembly, naming the deceased, connecting him with others, evoking him, giving meaning to his death, organizing farewell.
This has been the case at the Père Lachaise Crematorium since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
In this context, since 2010, on La Toussaint, the crematorium of Père Lachaise has organized several ceremonies of memory, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who have been crematized in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, relocation for rats turns to controversy
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
Given the urgency of the situation, the Director of the Terres du Sud Habitat office, proposed, exceptionally and temporarily, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken excessive proportions, says Joël Canapa, director of the office.
There have always been rats in towns.
The deratizing company carries out two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our charge, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not pull in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratizing products are four times less effective than in the past, but for two rats, one will not kill a child.
"We didn't invite the rats home," said the father of the family who left his home to move to the hotel.
We are soon out of the money and we are expecting a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The quotation suffered from the fall of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning on its annual earnings launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped by more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house preyed by flames in Old Quebec
A fire that started Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than thirty firefighters were dispatched to rue Hébert 9.
The flames were declared in a house of three dwellings spread over four floors located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings glued here," said France Loiselle, a spokesman for the Quebec fire department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremonial master at Palace Theatre on Broadway, started telling jokes directly in front of the audience, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has perpetuated over the years, until it was more recently resumed by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up club Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows performed in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of the headlines emerged in the Carolinas, and they had great success, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival with the aim of continuing to work with them.
This year’s event will include the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stand Up for Heroes”, a comedy and music evening for veterans, held at Madison Square Garden, with Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, just like the world of comedy.
Several of the actors attending this year’s festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, for example showing on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll appeared on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a wired channel (“The League” on FXX’s joyfully lacify football fantasy theme) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is nevertheless best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, along with other singularly voiced young actors (surrealistic pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became a successful film and television director, as well as an informal comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He was telling me that when he was here, sometimes he went down a lane between two buildings and thought to himself, Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come to live here.
Oil prices continue to drop and close to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to drop on Friday as concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that the Chinese electricity manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. reference crude for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in late morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% drop for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing industry arrived on Friday, which show business growth, suggest a rise in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been seen in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Abortion Right in Texas
A federal court of appeal has restored some restrictions on the right to voluntary interruption of pregnancy in Texas that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgment means that a bill passed in July in that state and largely questioning the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice GIVs will have to have a "admission privilege" with local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a caregivers member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment there.
IVG advocates argue that the contents of the law could lead to an immediate closure of one-third of the state clinics because these clinics failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, on the eve of the entry into force of the law, a trial judge had considered the provisions dealing with the admission privilege to be unconstitutional.
But Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who fights the post of governor, asked the appeal court to cancel the first-instance judgment that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star achieved a strong audience-side return, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show at the meeting?
Approximately 10,000 candidates appeared at the auditions of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the bad Sinclair, the perche André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of returning to their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored at this first premium.
As every year, the first audition shows bring a wide selection of singers to the best and sometimes to the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some have found their account.
Many of them have tried the New Star, and sometimes even gone to the end.
Behind the TV screens, vocations as a successful singer are still there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make them laugh.
Court blocks ruling on NYPD control and search policy
A federal court of appeal blocked a judge's decision on Thursday demanding changes to the New York Police Department's control and search program and removed it from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the city's appeal concluded.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and question citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and related training program.
The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday the arguments concerning the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which it publicly reacted to the court's critics.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
She appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the implementation of a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in the areas where the largest number of checks take place.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of persons whose case was rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the city's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of control and search has been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and search has existed for decades in some form, but the number of recorded controls has increased dramatically under the administration of Independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls mainly concerning black and Hispanic men.
Judicial action was brought in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and has turned into collective action.
Supporters advocating for changes in the NYPD’s control and search program say they will end unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and be able to change the way police departments use policy.
The opponents say these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, represent a waste of money, and would not solve the broader problem of pressured police forces after police personnel have been sharply reduced over the past decade.
The judge stressed that it was not ending constitutional control and search practices, but that it was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must go to vote, as each of them pays on average $100 per month on the price of housing that goes into taxes to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each housing.
We are obliged to raise rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can no longer afford $100,000 fireworks, $4 to $5 million land in case...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 square meters of the Elysian kitchens as committed after working in embassies, the cook climbed all levels to become chef, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande to Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their vacation places, and fed an innumerable number of great people in this world in an almost anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at age 60.
The man with an open face, skull and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin is holder of a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
“I’ve moved from one castle to another!” ironizes Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the mania of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his wife or wife who chooses the menus," he recalled.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
It disagrees with heads of state who showed relative indifference to terrestrial foods, "they are all gourmets," kindly denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, “he’s someone who likes to eat” and “there’s not much he doesn’t like.”
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has “no specific regime demand.”
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at the Elysee: “We have to serve between 200 and 250 people in about an hour.”
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The former chef of the Elysée, who took a drink on Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, is leaving with a pinch in the heart.
He said praise.
“His human side has come out,” he says.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in the Old Quebec on Friday noon.
The four-home building, located at 15 rue Hébert, has been the subject of three alarms with the fire department.
The fire declared itself at the front, but rose on all three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, a spokesman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has helped prevent the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where the buildings are built closely.
The burnt house housed four homes, but no tenants were on site at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine the origin, but the Sapers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: Release of the Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese misses some images of his next film, whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decouple you in his role as a cowardly trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island Stock Exchange broker, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort set up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the vertiginous fall that will follow.
Without limits, man chains parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its assembly too long.
It seems that the film lasts at 2:45.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to participate accurately in the Oscars race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” to try to confirm a fake pipe on a liaison involving the then-in-going Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said in the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her “nice special adviser.”
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby’s voice box and “permanently crack at his door,” but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
“The indictment suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man standing in front of people’s house hoping to surprise them, it’s the kind of man who likes to present history to people to see what they are saying about it,” Edis said.
He said NotW was using three ways to investigate the topics: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say “Of course it is.”
The rumors about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said that she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which voice messages were hacked on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private detective's computer involving Miss Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls requesting information about her, Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Ms. Pawlby's slightest facts and gestures.
In a voice message he left to him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story we plan to publish tomorrow that I really would like to talk to Charles.”
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history has followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was attending co-defender Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiracy with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to conducting telephone hacking.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister in the wake of violence
The president was expected to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday 1 November 2013, seeking help from the United States to fight the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq saw its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures published on Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations reports a higher score with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
These violence are becoming increasingly deadly despite strengthened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence causes fears of a new burning as neighboring Syria is preying on a civil war.
Bombs strike markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot down the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unfair arrests, has favored this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, the day after at least 26 people were killed in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been attributed to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with al-Qaeda (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri al-Maliki wants a “world war” against al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the heart of the U.S. interviews with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, which will be received by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the U.S. President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and congressional elected officials.
On Thursday, he pleaded for the international community to lead a "third world war" against al-Qaeda.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shia, assigning him the partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also called for Barack Obama to make it clear to Nouri Al Maliki that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uighur group of attacking Tiananmen
The chief of domestic security accused a group of Xinjiang Uyghur separatists on Friday of being behind the car bombing that killed five people in central Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, struck the crowd on the famous Chinese capital square, symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and set fire killing its three passengers and two passengers.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of domestic security issues, accused the Islamic movement in East Turkestan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there, driven by independence demands.
“The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated,” Meng told Hong Kong’s Phoenix TV.
"The group standing behind the scenes was the Islamic movement in East Turkestan," he added, his statements being taken up by the news agency China.
Chinese police have identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic movement in East Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican surveys contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a large poll around the world on how parishes manage sensitive files such as contraception, divorce, and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests treat gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage bonds.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each National Conference of Bishops, with the injunction of obtaining as many answers as possible.
The information will serve for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokeswoman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to survey parishioners.
In the UK, bishops have published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: the army attacks the last feud of rebels
The irreducible M23, or a few hundred fighters, were cut off at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two towns located about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," an inhabitant of Jomba told AFP, joined by phone around 12:30 a.m., according to which a girl was shot injured in the morning.
“The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little,” he added, “it seems that the DRC’s FARDC Armed Forces have pushed the rebels a little back.”
According to the witness, wanting to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spended the night" in Jomba before going to the front for a "rating operation".
Behind him were very clearly heard crepitations fed with light weapons.
From Bunagana, a political fief and last strong place in the rebellion on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission of the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase" with the FARDC "encircled residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army on Friday, Monusco has not directly participated in the fighting, but it provides decisive support for government troops in terms of intelligence, observation and planning.
In the late afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were climbing towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, military aided by civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand-new FARDC truck to replace another vehicle piloting the M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila once again called on the rebels on Wednesday night to “demobilize voluntarily” under penalty of being disarmed “by force”, but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without any result at the moment.
On the spot, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
“We have finished the talks, only Ugandan mediation is left to organize the signature,” said Roger Lumbala, vice president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mostly Tutsi, joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where some 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the return movement to DRC that started in the morning reversed at midday.
"This morning we crossed to go to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," Imelda Nyirankusi told AFP, surrounded by her nine children, including one infant on the back.
It feels like the shootings are getting closer to the population.
Early in the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, this stage beast
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the sung and danced productions take their flight.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical affirms itself as a genre of success.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart's opera rock, most attempts were entangled in ridicule.
And successes such as Cabaret or The Miserables carried the aureole of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the point.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as hit tubes.
The first takes on, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next the global creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes, musical shows such as "1789", "Lovers of the Bastille" and small musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" set a glimpse of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de musiques" and speaker at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard conquered.
How are French musicals evolving?
The offer has increased.
First, there are the "musical spectacles" that evolve at the will of the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story like in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others jump fifteen years back on the pretext that you can serve almost anything when you have Matt Pokora at the top of the poster.
Afterwards, we have the musicals with the sumptuous Châtelet productions that bring us back to the Broadway Golden Age and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like "Rent", "The Spider Woman's Kiss" or "Spring Awakening" are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough artists capable like Broadway of singing, playing and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists turning from projects to projects.
In the United States, the cradle of the musical is very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs among regional theatres, tours, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The number of talents is as high as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often a boulevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Music shows fill this lack.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the forefront of a musical show is the assurance of an enthusiasm of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are skillfully maintained by professionals who answer the questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a Zenith province.
The mayonnaise was climbed in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major halls in France in the same form as in Paris.
Severe wounded in accident with ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning around 5:30 a.m. on the Brussels inner ring at Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is innocent to her.
The ring was closed to traffic, until 9:00 a.m., at the location of the accident, the time the road is cleared and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation caused little traffic jams because the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this output/entry of the ring.
Child seriously injured in attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured in an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His life prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army is preparing new assault
Children play on a carbonized armor belonging to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on 31 October 2013 in eastern DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new assault on Friday on the last M23 rebel bastions near Bunagana in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday we took the hill of Bugina, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on her own.
There will be only the Runyonyi hill.
"Chanzu's is not very strategic," North Kivu governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku plans to travel to Bunagana on Saturday.
Political stronghold and last strong place of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was taken over by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 irreducibles have been cut off at nearly 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the neighboring town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting throughout the day on Thursday said the situation was "quiet since this morning."
According to him, a woman and her child were killed in the battles the previous day and were buried.
One girl was shot and three others injured, including one seriously evacuated by the FARDC, the witness said.
Since the resumption of the fighting between the FARDC and the rebels on October 25, the two belligerents have not reported the loss of human lives.
NSA Reveals Increase Business Paranoia on State Surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a helicopter of the German police flew over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
At the order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media said the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence services, once again stressed in September that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower, began to unveil his inexhaustible treasure of information about the secrets of U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to believe the director on the word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever provoked corporate paranoia over state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence agencies and businesses transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data is used in their mutual interest.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the U.S. poses an equal risk to China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a July survey published by the consulting firm EY.
However, in all documents released by Mr. Snowden, there is no evidence to date that the United States has passed on industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians expressed their concern that the EU lacks sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believes it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Corporate leaders are skeptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them.
“This is not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn't let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. espionage agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations has been a shock for some companies that until then thought China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members gave up their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after disclosures about the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers today ask us a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where are my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically within that jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that, therefore, these data must be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of BASF chemicals producing company.
The Americans are commercially and industrially spying on us just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Corporate leaders are generally unlikely to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, in case that would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long hammered the message that it is at least reckless to pick up a free USB stick at a professional lounge or leave a laptop unsupervised in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of Audi car manufacturer, said collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so that they could not be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones on their trips abroad because of the risk of harming the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid cell phones are then thrown away.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerts its own companies to economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) in February cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, second-degree guilty of conducting economic intelligence hacking acts behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a renowned German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, the DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died under unusual circumstances believe their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a rolled fighting carpet at his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck on January 11 in a supported carpet standing behind the gym grades of his high school.
Lowndes County Sheriff’s investigators concluded that Johnson had died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old’s family challenged these findings.
“They are absolutely sure their son has been murdered,” Benjamin Crump, attorney representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as stated in the Sheriff's conclusions.
“They think this challenges all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these findings were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a cardboard and were returned to them in a mortuary bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I think there is sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from “positional asphyxia.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Many questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence that justifies a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Lowndes County Sheriff's office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgian judge ordered authorities on Wednesday to hand over all video surveillance recordings investigators had examined.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the video images would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children for schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-aged children suffering from food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of food allergies in children and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the most commonly used EpiPen branded auto-injector – to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislative assemblies have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “I feel like something sticks my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I feel like I have a tingling on my tongue.”
NSA case highlights total lack of intelligence debate
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand offends itself in public by summoning the US ambassador on October 21, and on the other hand prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, based on rumors of being on board Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response on the part of the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the scale of U.S. surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the World Columns a few weeks apart the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence on the one hand and on the other a condemnation of the listening of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn’t it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows each citizen to forge an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by the US diplomacy of political or other issues around the world, we indeed consider that, in view of the US power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to be outraged at this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did France benefit from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American collaboration?
The deployment of very powerful technology interception tools by the United States, but also by France, for almost a decade has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States, in particular, have implemented procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described as essential on both sides.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in tribal areas at Miranshah has been reported to the French thanks to the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to the U.S. services, and, in return - it has already been quickly said - the Americans can give information to the French about other parts of the world.
So the substantive question behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to provide themselves with interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, especially within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of infringements of freedoms.
What does the United States really risk? a deterioration of its image?
Even if we denounce them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk of Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies — and this has been the case recently — learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest peak of their state, have been guarded.
This is the case in Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been tense.
Another effect may be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the disclosures, to entrust their confidential data to U.S. providers subject to U.S. laws, and thus to the NSA’s grip.
Last element: The vast movement of disclosures engaged by media around the world, which helps launch a debate on the practical surveillance practices of intelligence services so far almost non-existent, could push lawmakers, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of Intersex Childs May Choose “Indeterminate Sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be attributed to them, in a rigid manner, at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child’s gender, allowing them to enter an “indefinite” or “unspecified” gender on their birth certificate.
The aim of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors created, contusionate and bullfighted.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersexual, intersexuality belonging to the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term referring to people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most U.S. specialists say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and track the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It’s like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not linked to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and is not clearly defined as either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, hair mass, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and prejudiced crimes.
Young non-conforming boys now have camps that are specially intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her appeal trial that allows her to keep a “unspecified” sex for life.
The German passports will include a third designation alongside M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers in this primarily Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school books.
The American site Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that “since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, we overthrow two other pillars of civilization.”
In Maryland, a baby's mother also said on Baby Zone that she would rather have sex attributed to babies at birth.
“The parent role is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sex organs were called Hermaphrodites, from the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And just about a decade ago, the medical community regarded gender as a slate, which can be erased and on which can be redrawn.
But now there are many who challenge the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He devoted the term “sex identity” and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as being male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a cramped circumcision to castre him entirely, also removing his testicles, and raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that wasn’t the case,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some doctors “always repeat this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these gender change operations say, “[that] they are not satisfied with the outcome.”
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was forced to take female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he said on ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he again became a man, following a testosterone treatment and was removed from his breasts.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites to labelling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their children an ‘indeterminate’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage intervention.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said his organization supported Australia’s law because it “permits adults to choose to be recognized as the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should lead at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a mammogram radiologist in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law will “give responsibility” to parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of her androgen receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and an intern in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or carrying mothers.
“The law leaves a certain latitude to parents so they don’t have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a delay before entering "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that’s something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta believes that his government will continue until 2015 despite strong tensions between the left and right in the ruling coalition as the Senate approaches the vote to dismiss Silvio Berlusconi from his term.
In an interview with the newspaper La Stampa, the left-wing leader said he “closed his intention” to continue governing with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper chamber of the Italian parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council sentenced for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, pronounces his destitution.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 its refusal to give in to the orders of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a U.S. Transportation Security Agency agent, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called at the scene of the drama claimed to have responded to a call saying "multiple injuries."
"Law enforcement is on the spot," the airport said on its Twitter account, as television images showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a cot, and a second one transported on a wheelchair.
The incident occurred around 9:30 a.m. locally (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at terminal 3 at the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times states that the 2 and 3 events are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to immediately confirm whether one of his employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli Army Kills Hamas Member in Gaza-Sces
Israeli tank fires killed an Islamist Palestinian militant from Hamas on Thursday and severely injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, according to health services sources.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in the area as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fires.
The Israeli army merely mentioned a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Obama’s campaign considered to drop Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisors have considered, in the greatest secret, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most striking event that appears in the long-awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday night that the president’s close collaborators had conducted “in-depth group work and polls at the end of 2011” to see if Biden’s eviction could help Obama in his re-election as his hopes diminished.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, namely former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, aimed at measuring what effect the replacement of the Vice President by former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the poll.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within the Chicago Campaign Headquarters and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the president – including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina and former White House advisors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties," before finally deciding against the change when figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "does not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were saying, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley called the examination “concerned,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested a lot to find out if the change would be beneficial during the poll.
“The campaigns don’t spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is unclear whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible redesign.
Although Daley said he did not think the president “was aware” of the possible change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not answer definitively the question of whether political polls had arrived at Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he was seriously thinking that Obama did not know that Biden's expulsion from the presidential list was being discussed.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first fluorescent ice cream made of medusa.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He got the idea after reading a study on meduses and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the shiny protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that since the ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I’m Delicious, said: “It’s something incredible but we’re only at the beginning in terms of production, and 2 grams of this stuff costs about <0xC2><0xA3>200.”
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice begins to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed opportune to share it with everyone at the time of Halloween as it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever created because the luminescence of meduses is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it's pretty good taste!
The Bristol-based Charlie experimental company is known for its unusual ice cream scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation appears to be even more ambitious.
He added, “I really want to develop an invisible ice.”
This is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do it.
The ice uses the fluorescent properties of the medusa synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and aimed at the inhabitants of the town of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st Tai Chi movement, with his hands as a musician shattering the air,” Laurie Anderson wrote.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she promised her husband, the week before his death, to take him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are urban citizens, it is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many the tremendous joy of life that he had."
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today I've become more piggy.
In the last two years, I haven’t distributed a single candy and I definitely won’t do it anymore this year.
But the statistics show that I'm the wicked sheep when we're talking about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is the trends.
The costumes are expected to represent $1.2 billion out of the 6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the television series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men of Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no problem staying traditional.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year, according to the NRF.
It's a lot of curious dogs disguised as hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't goose.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion on sweets this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kilograms of Hershey bars, suckers, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is a great news for the 41 million children who go to candy hunt in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we’re going to buy and, don’t tell stories, consume 41 million kilos of chocolate on Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don’t want to eat; yet almost 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This amounts to about 9 billion corn grains.
This is a mystery that I have not yet been able to clarify.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted homes in the U.S., which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to the American Haunts, and that includes those amazing photos of you pissing on you that your friends put on Facebook and you can’t remove and on which a guy you like leaves a “nice head” style comment.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin in the shape of a lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve done since we were young.
Fortunately for us, the “baby pumpkin trend” only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these potty and didn’t have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Pumpkin lanterns that slowly wander on your home’s porch probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon to Napa, California, and try carving their 922 kg pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bad bank with 38 billion pounds (€45 billion) of most risky assets, a measure aimed at relaxing its relations with London and accelerating its reprivatization.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55 percent to 70 percent over the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned up the balance sheet over the next three years.
RBS also said it would include an additional provision for depreciation of dubious debts of <0xC2><0xA3>4 to <0xC2><0xA3>4.5 billion over the quarter, a statement related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also said that this internal restructuring would release <0xC2><0xA3>10 to <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion in capital, thus strengthening its capacity to borrow.
The bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" would make it possible to draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of interfering with the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and the UK,” Ross McEwan, the new CEO, told the press.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that gives access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally fans who join Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really pleased to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try on different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigour and realities of raid rallying.
We had a lot of pleasure developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above ground on an unstable corniche in a quarry.
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, escaped after a serious road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog trapped in the quarry.
Firefighters descended as a reminder along the cliff to recover the dog and save her from a certain death.
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to recover it safely as it was perched 15 meters above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared in the career following an unserious accident.
Around 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-looking person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a corniche in the quarry, stuck 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed onto the scene and came down as a reminder to save Ruby using an animal cot to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn’t move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's okay now.
She ate some cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's incredible that someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said, “Ruby was very lucky to get out of it in no way.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check; her overall condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified to watch the rescue."
I didn't think she was upstairs.
It was surprising to have him in his arms again.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really courageous.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely great.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: “We were afraid she would fall but she didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was upstairs.
Mick Jagger says he never flirted Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a choirist on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He dragged me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very nice.”
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old Jagger's representative said he "categorically denies having made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added, "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, “Prism,” landed in the top place of the charts this week.
Beijing challenges a Turkmenistan Islamic movement
“Behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia,” the chief of Chinese security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has appointed a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominant region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with gas canisters against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which declares fighting for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, former name of Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the UN in 2002 among the organizations affiliated with Al Qaeda.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for the sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives Scottish choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to be able to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wires along the Hadrian Wall.
While it is true that the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic impacts of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and was to be predicted).
No one has said either that the EU Member States spend much of their time bypassing their formal rules when they do so.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continuous failure to comply with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from Scots.
This is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it's now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
Yet one interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland actually follow the instructions of Europe?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely dead.
With the euro crisis, the Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout Europe, parties opposing the EU or fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered nearly five million votes in the September federal elections and pulled the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the burden on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many people to think that the Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments that have excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has placed foreign exchange rates favorable to German exporters on its members – which German politicians want to retain.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of Southern Europe end up with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only resort is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper discomfort related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German companies in the energy sector at the consumer expense – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as for gas as the US.
This is a redundant disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage freezes in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by a cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, the revolt roars, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, letting the French economy undermine.
As a result, the far-right party of Marine Le Pen, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial partial election, putting the Socialists in power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot start from the assumption that a split of the right will automatically favor the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with her new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single and anti-European anti-currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties do well in these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the unique anti-European and anti-currency sentiment in Europe will unify and ultimately kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will more resemble the “Europe of Nations (sovereigns)” free privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to take its distance from this project, and I hope it will make a gentle eye on the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of Little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending out Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more free European agreement provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government of Scotland is – and it should be noted – the most successful political anti-austerity movement in Europe, since it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chess Board Chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the Conservative/Liberal coalition followed-Democrats.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland now to vote for independence if it was to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Ageing Early
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent.
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the obesity outbreak could be a trigger for early puberty
The tendency toward early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter’s pubic breasts and hair start growing at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as budding of breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odours, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of the first menstruation over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12 years three quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast has started to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first menstruation appears,” said Kaplowitz, also author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered “early” when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
Faster evolution may justify testing by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature bone aging that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormone treatment are based on the child's age, development rate, growth rate and affective maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medications but acknowledges that “controlling puberty can alleviate certain behavioural problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don’t want their very young girls to have their menstruation.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they’re going to handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first menstruation at age 10.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She returned from school scared and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls aged 6 to 9 years that links the percentage of fat mass to the outbreak of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have younger hair on the face and in the pubic area, the tendency to true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the PAA conference stressed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be cautious about how we identify the true appearance of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“It may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally react well.
Girls whose puberty is early should be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen Brothers, Grand Prix of the latest Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that began to resonate with it just before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinematheque, had scored the Golden Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their turn on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the world pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be a accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious rejoicing.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's wealthy atmospheres in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less shining clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the oath debited to the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week of the tribulations of a folk singer who can't pierce and get angry with the whole world.
He accepts retreat replacements to the lifted foot in the studios.
Without housing, he tours the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who isn't here at the right time, who isn't careerful but integrity, with self-destructive behavior," Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and awards in Cannes, told the press.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two folk music fans have built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would generate international stars" as writes journalist Elijah Wald, Van Ronk's friend.
The film then takes the appearance of documentary, the dusty music label invaded by 33T unsold inhabited by an unpaid old secretary, the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen Brothers still operates by integrating a strange character who is continually through the film: a beautiful red cat with a cracking eye, Llewyn Davis’s companion of fortune.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled "grew up in Tennessee, bathed by blues and country."
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to “be considered good,” “random can also start someone’s career,” and “increasingly today.”
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be caught up by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He never knew the word retirement.
Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times consecrated him as “the author of spy novels who knew too much.”
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198 and 199s of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically decreased by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was moving during this trip with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, assured that he ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
“It’s likely that between 120 and 150 million countries are all confused,” he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Foch Avenue near the Arc de Triomphe, the malignant eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which SAS's adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, designating a stack of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivory trees of the 130 countries that have been reported to place his novels there.
For the price of a packet of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman at the advantageous chest, wearing a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his Serenissima Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a silverless Austrian aristocrat and contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, throws himself in the kits of all the villains on earth, Communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a zeste of violence and torture.
“I never claimed to be a literary author,” explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I don’t send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went on the spot and returned with real and long investigations."
The father of SAS said "make a kind of geopolitical leaflet."
“I am constantly in my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving,” Gérard de Villiers said.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, people of the services I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: thus, a month before the attack on a command center of the Syrian regime having killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "The Fools of Benghazi," he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the murder of Egyptian President Anuar El-Sadate in "The Conspiracy of Cairo", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported the 4X4 columns of jihadists based on the Malian capital.
I am not a guess, Gérard de Villiers defended himself, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions are realized.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his IBM marguerite writing machine dating from 1976 "whose all parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page on the pen.
At the walls of his office are hanging AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machism by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sex objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcomed in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not of age."
He will not die or retire.
No more than me.
Aircraftmakers argue about the width of seats while large commands are at stake
The dispute is raging among major aeronautical manufacturers over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai aeronautical fair that takes place this month.
The conflict is about the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economic class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but to whom the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to set up a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its major U.S. rival Boeing says it should be airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as aircraftmakers seek to sell even bigger versions of their bimotor long-haul aircraft, eventually hoping for a record order at the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing says its redesigned “777X” will be able to accommodate 406 people in economic class seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economic class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aerospace giants often exchange shots on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to take the lead on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
Recently, we were able to realize what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus Commercial Director.
As eating habits change, people grow fat, but seats in planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing’s jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turning point of the century, the average American weight of 40 to 49 years of age increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average waist of the 21st century American is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept dating back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named jet set aircraft was narrower.
Airbus has ordered a study that indicates an additional inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing challenges Airbus’ numbers regarding seat width and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket price and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that the cabin experience does not only depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and enabling them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their operations,” said Kent Craver, who is responsible for passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to order aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at the market price in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters said for the first time in July, the seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 percent higher seat performance in their latest long-haul bimotor models than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the configured device with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to house more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Director of Confort Passenger at European aircraft carrier Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers vote in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper rates.
“A 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, indoor cabin expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers that airlines should choose from.
Aircraft sellers who travel around the world even take a meter with them to check the competing configurations.
While offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider side seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say it is unlikely that his appeal to the aeronautical industry to set up a size standard for seats will succeed, but that it could forget the wave of sales of 777X.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the proposed remuneration for founder and CEO Larry Ellison on Thursday, in view of the group's financial performance.
The vote isn't binding, but it dims the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just hoarding his boat's victory at the Americas Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had received a negative vote on his remuneration.
Oracle’s boss renounced a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year closed in May due to the group’s poor performance, which missed its growth goals, but he collected about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only one symbolic dollar.
Over the entire year offset 2013, Oracle's net earnings increased by 3.5%, while the stock exchange price increased by 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index that rose 24% at the same time.
New nicotine vaccine could suppress smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before starting trials on humans, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York stated that the early signs were encouraging.
“We truly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available today on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from getting his/her nicotine dose.
In the tests, vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice that had not been vaccinated “were soothed,” the researchers said, signing that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remain high that they were too expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it transforms liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, security services said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence, military and activist movement officials said he had lost his life in this strike in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone fire," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, traveling to London, informed the British government that discussions had been started with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denied being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the state’s anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied that he had changed the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to determine whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid own two restaurants and one coffee shop, after their expiry in August 2005, without a call for tenders.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony by Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary-General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressed for leases to be the subject of a tender.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer duration.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay companies, which earned the Obeid approximately $2.5 million a year, were renewed without a tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied that he had changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, acknowledged by Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government lease policy.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obeid at the Ministry of Fisheries.
“The topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of commercial lease policy?” Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but at least it wasn't that.
At least not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirms to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes against missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a “authenticity” test
The government is currently considering the possibility of implementing a “authenticity” test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it is considering extending repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion intended to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a diverted means of bringing his family and friends to Australia.
A government working document was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbors.
“The shattering statements about ‘foreigners returning to the end of the line’ and ‘jobs for Australians first’ are an unpleasant return to a time when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historic artifact.
The work paper outlines the 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to find out “whether the job offer is authentic in the event that the applicant is a relationship or a personal partner of the owner or person concerned within the company sponsoring it.”
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker allegedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The nine-year-old boy was traveling to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father died Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland has been launched by the British government.
HS2 Ltd's work suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and Northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Baroness Minister of Transport Kramer said the project “would bring the UK together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will cover a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed connection between London and northern England, from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study rail capacity building and improving travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travel times between Glasgow and Edinburgh of up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because its benefits are huge.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity problem in our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “unmistakably” support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland’s economic weight to the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
“So we are excited to work in partnership with the UK government to consider options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and completing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and then we will decide together on the next steps.”
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will continue to shut down their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to soften electronic device regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open to U.S. carriers for a change in their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in “plane” mode.
Passengers can already do this for most of the flight, but many people find it painful not to be able to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to immediately change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases remain in force in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” she said.
The issue is the subject of regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure continuous safety and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to the CASA about its intention to expand the use of its on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said it would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we truly believe it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said it is currently complying with current rules.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to immediately change that,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review manuals, training equipment, hand luggage programs and passenger instructions.
“As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely placed under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people, according to testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was busy on the side of Pia where a dispute involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries are to be deplored.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the spot to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s waiver lenders take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a lender at the Bendemeer Mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay her daughters’ tuition fees.
“My husband and I have just bought a house so all my money has gone in,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore (2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband works as well, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third guarantee loan company to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Selling jewelry isn’t just a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in Mrs. Amirthalinga’s case – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore’s guarantee lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, bail lenders have the advantage of not asking for solvency verification or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to payroll lenders as families feel the pressure of increasing living costs and overindebted households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit powered by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and medium-income families turn to borrowers to bridge the difference as their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' solvency.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt/gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia ranked at the top of the list with 80% of GDP, while it was 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has just emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed ongoing weak exports and slowing consumer demand.
“The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people in the middle or down [of the wage scale] are looking to complete their income as they can,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have caused people to rush to secure their personal belongings to reach the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items placed on deposit in the city-state’s 200 deposit shops are made of gold.
People say, “The price of gold is high, let’s put the grandmother’s gold chain on hold and we’ll come back to pick it up next month.”
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest loan shop operator, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops over the past few months.
The increase is so high in the loan sector that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemeer store and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO.
The company will finance them using 60% of Singapore’s $66 million it raised this week when it introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rated lenders have eased criticism of the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah indicates that not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but that it does not directly increase debt.
“Customers mortgage assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
Guarantee is becoming more and more socially accepted as a means of obtaining guaranteed short-term financing.
People who go to deposit lenders are not just those who have financial problems.
Wealthy people in Singapore also go to ValueMax waiver loan shops to waiver gold bars or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all layers of society.
“These may be wealthy people who need short-term borrowing for business or investment, or small businesses who need cash to go a tough course,” adds Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor accused of juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who took care of young people in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
30-year-old Aaron Hudgins was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church of Timberlay, where the pastor served, was deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it should not communicate with people under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes to the supermarket in Nazi uniform, before being driven out.
A man wearing a Nazi uniform barbed in a bracelet with the gambling cross was asked to leave an English supermarket as customers complained to the management of the establishment that called the police, the store said Friday.
“We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store,” said a spokeswoman for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to rescue, but "as soon as she arrives, he had already gone without a blast," she added.
I was queuing when I saw a woman who looked upset.
People were beaten mouth.
“You don’t go out on the street like that unless you want to get attention,” a 60-year-old client, Rosina Rusin, told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a scam.
A man from Cambridge claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
“I’ve been wearing a black SS bracelet twice a week for three years at Asda,” said Paul Dutton, explaining that he suffered from “mental problems.”
Rescue plan of $325 million for Tasmania's health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the wavering health system has strict conditions to ensure that the government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking “urgent steps” to end a crisis caused by the ageing population in the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the system constraints.
The funding, scheduled for four years, was decided after consultations by the government with Tasmania’s independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will solve the unique difficulties facing the state,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgery.
Additional 2,600 operations, especially in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataracts, will help catch up with the delay.
Funding is also provided for non-meeting clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, medical executive training, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to frontline clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania’s health system,” said Mrs. Plibersek.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors in which it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient way possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless they are followed by a genuine reform to strengthen Tasmania's public health system."
He nevertheless congratulated the government for responding to the request for urgent aid that it submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing Tasmania’s public health system from the blacklist,” Wilkie said.
According to the government, these additional non-urgence procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “solution of fortune.”
“The reason we’re here is that the Labour government of the state has withdrawn $430 million from its healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
We can't have a government of the state that pulls out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in $300 million, and pretends that it's a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts of a remarkable artistic direction and a careful reconstitution of the period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Unfolding in France of the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the endless cruelty of one deliberately sadistic Superior Mother and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, surveillance agency declares
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons surveillance body said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) arrived one day ahead of the deadline of
November 1 fixed by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machinery intended to mix toxic gases and fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tonnes of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the neurotoxic agent sarin.
The announcement was made as the fighting was raging Thursday in the city of Safira, which according to experts is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the British-based Syrian Human Rights Observatory reported.
The group of activists, which follows the evolution of the human balance sheet through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
An estimated 61,067 civilians were among them, including 6,365 children.
On the government’s side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, 18,678 of whom were pro-government fighters and 187 of Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It is also estimated that 2,202 of the dead were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
About 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad’s troops are fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups in the Al Qaeda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no precision.
The fighting highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they have to complete their mission, to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a ongoing civil war, within tight deadlines.
A statement by the OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, stated that its team was “now satisfied that they had controlled – and been destroyed – all the declared critical production and mixing and filling machines.”
She added that “no other inspection activities were planned at the moment.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... that the elements of the chemical weapons program that they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which have been inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I commend the moral strength and courage that you all have shown in the context of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu in a commentary.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes the Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of el-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawi sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by sentencing one of the Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted angry to the sentence imposed on the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years fleeing as one of the most sought after men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in manufacturing explosives used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on conditional release.
The 45-year-old was convicted of mass killing for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also convicted of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have requested a life imprisonment sentence, yet they could have requested that the man, called the "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in bombing, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the brink of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have taken the same path as other men.
“It should be dragged in front of the execution peloton,” Ms. Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blow up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell in a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and was “dead” three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said Patek should have experienced the same fate as the other three members of Jemaah Islamiyah’s terrorist cell responsible for the slaughter – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for nearly 10 years but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in order to restore ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
“He didn’t surrender,” Corteen added.
Until recently, he was laughing at the grief he could have caused to other people.
The verdict was rendered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” Corteen said.
However, Patek can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on board planes (but not make a call with their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phones – under the long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate change.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules to be in compliance.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the plan, we could approve a broader use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are not supposed to turn them on again until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers are supposed to turn off their aircraft when descending from the plane before landing and not re-on until the plane has set itself down.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during takeoffs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was pleased with these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will benefit everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room supervisors” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in aircraft mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone in 2011 when he was expelled to noise from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his aircraft while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be arranged because they could hurt someone if they were flying through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory power for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered to be risky.
“Mobile phones are truly a problem, not only because they could possibly create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board,” Rosenker said.
An Industrial Advisory Committee established by the FAA to review the issue recommended last month that the government allow a broader use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no valid reason for security for these bans.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget or deliberately turn off their aircraft.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have allowed their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems also better resist interference.
The vast majority of aircraft are expected to allow broader use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those pushing for easing restrictions on passengers’ use of electronic devices.
In 2011, the company’s leaders loaded a Kindle e-book reader line plane and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there was none.
This inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee to have mixed feelings as to whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with the systems of an aircraft, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common sense arrangements for technology-equipped travelers.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicoptered bird from a platform in the North Sea was released into nature
A bird, helicoptered after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into the wild.
The helicopter was mounted on board a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was put on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its Alloa rescue center.
The head of the center, Colin Seddon, said: “This water graze was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and found himself caught amid violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help.”
The water was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we ordered the widest and most comprehensive survey from the UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions in Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside of Europe, focusing on modernizing and developing countries while EU states are stagnant.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than engaging in the long and arduous process of reforming the European institutional arcane.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders think that controlling these key skills should be in the hands of Westminster.
The single market has caused general dissatisfaction, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trade area – 40 percent of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and even more so, our survey of entrepreneurs revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives in favour of a treaty change and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the corporate world insists on a “significant change” that restores power to the UK.
The challenges are high – achieving a change in the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would make it possible to see a shift of 16% of the votes in favour of the country remaining in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will represent a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the hands of the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is committing itself to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means putting the focus again on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama did not deviate from the Halloween tradition.
Together with his wife last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of guest children in the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the festivities have come back.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade in the Greenwich Village neighborhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to wear the costume I had planned last year.
We have fun like crazy people, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
It's a good kid, it's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, Gazprom Director said.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest large-scale project in Europe,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterpart, which transits most Russian gas to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director added.
Miller added that the direct junction to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project comes into service in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, the newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, taking up information from Radio Australie.
This island, east of the Gambier archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 square kilometres, if you have three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty Mutiniers, an episode of the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutins, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends 95% on the generosity of London.
The Council of the Island unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, or 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this application.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that creating such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuary those 836,000 square kilometres, however, provided that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance ships.
As for France, it already has to carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia EEZ, neighbouring Pitcairn.

Life Prison for Former Chinese Deputy Governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin province in northeastern China was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of achieving more than 19 million yuan of bribes, official Chinese media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the president of Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing’s first intermediate court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon poses a threat to the Communist Party's very existence.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as untreatable with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of senior officials were convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions within the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, a party-independent body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault on allegations against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two YMCA employees in New South Wales were accused of sexual assault on children following allegations against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord during a 2011 hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned in two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a YMCA Caringbah Hall physical education monitor was convicted of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel to the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also acknowledged that the YMCA opening statement was inaccurate, emphasizing, “external YMCA checks were carried out and indicated that child safety was a top priority for the organization.”
It has been demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA was informed that it received the second worst assessment from four institutions during a Department of Education and Communities quality audit conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failures to the safety of children.
The staff testified that they had observed some flaws, including the fact that Lord stayed alone with the children, kept them privately, made them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them and let them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had requested training in child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found YMCA Caringbah’s Child Services Manager, Jacqui Barnat, who was instructing Lord “very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.”
The Director-General said he rejected staff testimony that they were reluctant to report these failures to their superior.
Instead, he said that the friendly relationships they had with Lord have blurred their judgment, causing them not to report his actions.
Mr. Hare said he had expressed his views before the YMCA council in New South Wales, saying that, for the organization, the lesson drawn from the “Jonathan Lord incident” should not concern “reporting” by staff, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were raised, was made by YMCA Chief Executive Officer for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that the decision was intended to avoid contamination of the evidence but that it was an “excess of zeal” and that it had been mis-implemented.
The YMCA in New South Wales was not a child-safe organization at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith, expert on child sexual violence to the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" with staff recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the fifth anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old expressed his opinion on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's Special Envoy for the Middle East Peace Process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair would have replied, according to the London Evening Standard, "Yes, of course, but it may likely happen, so..."
When many equestrian demonstration experts gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old boy.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the little one and his pony Shetland Toffee roamed during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – who are of the same size – were hailed for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Featuring elegant melon hats against men and women, he wore his flat cap a bit on the side casually to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was hailed by the judges for his uncommon natural dressage qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good scores for her presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for her 3rd birthday last March and has since trained with her Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, “Fenton and Toffee are an excellent duo.”
They presented themselves to and against all, but both took the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he was competing with Toffee and we were crazy about him winning.
On the track, people who didn’t know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, “There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded her.”
He walked the entire length of the track running and even though he seemed very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he will surely soon participate in the Horse of the Year demonstration – and I’m sure he will do a great performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian demonstration said, “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They are a good team.
Judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee were presenting well and how they marched on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the coach – Fenton and Toffee have been the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he looked really great.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be redesigned"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation will be redesigned, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou-based New Express has issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express is going to undergo a “complete redesign,” the regulator said.
The order of "reform" emanated from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles about the company listed in Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The writing of New Express was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided to "impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card."
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a comprehensive redesign of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation of the responsible persons at New Express and immediately reshape the newspaper’s management team.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction machine manufacturer named Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a first-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to posting fake stories for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence,” he told CCTV.
I did it mainly because I ran after money and celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express posted his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several major suspects have recently made television confessions.
Experts say people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier this year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
The Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailable"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is on the rail.
The radioactive steam leak detected on one of the two nuclear boilers in Charles de Gaulle in mid-October and while the boat was at sea was "safe for sailors", but is not without consequence for the Navy.
The Royale has just confirmed to us "the unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist in the defense naval, assures that its teams and those of Areva, sent to the Var for the occasion, are "currently intervening on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the failing boiler.
“Everything is being done so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013,” said DCNS.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not challenge the ship's activity program" with nuclear propulsion.
Remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier leaves an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had traveled from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "small damage", restricted to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any possible radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I am able to see a great dissatisfaction on the part of the people I encounter: monstrous revaluation of their properties, flood of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to end.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Scattered millions of dollars could be saved in order to enable a highly respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money forcibly taken from taxpayers decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all the major companies, we do not bother with the summit spending and the maintenance of the lame ducks: cultural center deficit, high subsidies to the Cité de l'Energie, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, they can be sold to a private company or demolished.
It is also deplorable to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that never came.
However, I make an honorable mention of the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost for taxpayers?
It is not on the public levels to invest in such companies, but on the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to hear that the fishing and pile lakes will continue to supply the city with clean drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the widespread decline of the population, the use of water has declined considerably throughout the territory.
Not to mention wasting it, the city will never lack water and strict regulations on its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to do great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed of defending such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is not even able to buy a pen without going through a borrowing settlement.
We have been managed for more than 40 years by cravates with nice degrees for most and I don't think a sheep farmer will do worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 4-foot-by-3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzag over a length equivalent to nearly six long football courts, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinite warehouses, which makes it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out of it unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to legal records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were working as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine with intention to sell.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment if sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers exploit vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that have to quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a crossing of about 700 yards equipped with railways that started from the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went to two San Diego warehouses.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said she issued a “notice of surrender” to the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after exhausting all possible ways under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he filed against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “issued a notice of surrender to a 40-year-old man asking him to present himself to a police station on the date and time of his choice,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions for his release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the opinion by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after unveiling more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks site fighting secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Do you have the passwords to type to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French and Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy general manager of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric."
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Privacy organizations confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned.
In 2011 alone and in France, the National Commission of Computer Science and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for recognition of fingerprints, the form of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone can soon be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, among some, and pessimism, among others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques that will provide new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
Each of these techniques has its own constraints.
“For example, some people who work concrete have fingers very damaged and their fingerprints are illegible,” said Philippe Robin, Technical Director of Identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand implies a voluntary and accurate gesture of the people.
This is both a security - we cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
Consequently, research has been conducted for about twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
Thanks to the increased accuracy of sensors and the computing capacity of computers needed for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
Face recognition accuracy has increased tenfold over the past five years, according to Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the UK and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but it takes a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and unfalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and prospective at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers a suitcase costing €90,000 to analyze DNA samples on the scene of a crime and within an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they claim to be).
The identification so far concerned the issue of identity documents: biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) must be confronted with the information that the state has on all citizens already registered.
This makes sure that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else’s identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or shop.
“We collect images from surveillance cameras and compare them to the photos of celebrities freely circulating on the Internet,” said Dany Nassif, head of business development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Another use: take a picture of a quidam that is in the queue in a store, track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication initially concerned physical access (border, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added to it.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend that pointes for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, more and more, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing your card and laying your hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the key of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and large-scale signs: when paying in store with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is scheduled to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer remains in the box thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you custom options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“Fingerprints are stored on a first server; people’s identities are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure enclosure, which blocks if you try to move it,” said Philippe Robin of Thales.
But lacking in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Privacy specialists continue to worry.
“The progress in facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, makes me fear the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick, of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between the legs was inflicted a <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 almond
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink laid in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at the height of Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn on his license led to a 6-month withdrawal of the license.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a fee of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a surcharge for a victim of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to burst the London bubble
The Treasury temporarily calculated the capital gains tax measure but awaits a final decision from Mr. Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, recorded a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own property in a company rather than on an individual basis.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, and amounts to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, exceeding the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and the Yorkshire and Humber region combined.
Mr. Cook said: “As a result of the increased stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on high-value properties, it is very difficult to say that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.”
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestige real estate – the 5-10 percent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located in southwestern London stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8 percent over the past year.
Prices in central London showed a steady growth of 5.6% from year to year but were overshadowed by a rapidly growing "domestic market", with the city's southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovery, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how a dog’s tail movements are linked to his mood.
Previous studies had shown that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that in man, the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what was going on with other species.
He added that, as in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain was responsible for moving to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to disordered tail movements from other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies with other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behaviour.
It will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We introduced dogs to movies with other dogs – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confusion – and we were able to trade the tail movement and present it as going more left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog without expression moving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail mainly turning left (again from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you meet other dogs repeatedly and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to that experience.”
The researchers say the results could enable owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a guest professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs were easier to go to a robot dog when his tail was moving to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming anxious—the opposite of what is stated in the Italian study.”
He said the differences could come from the fact that the dogs who participated in the different studies did not entirely regard film animals or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although many elements, collected from different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after their singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to perform Friday in the The Hydro concert hall in downtown.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogramme the show.
The announcement was made after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert.”
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact customer service at the ticket office where you purchased your tickets for further assistance.
Pope Francis appoints his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest placed churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will name his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – this corresponds to a group of 120 “electoral cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony in which bishops will be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as the consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal voters will likely decrease.
He said that a pope generally appointed as many cardinals as he needed for the number of cardinals voters to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 as he wanted.
Next year’s consistory will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis’ election in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favor Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world in charge of examining ways to reform the church.
Previously, the Pope decided on his own.
“François has now chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was “completely possible” for Francis to seek advice from the cardinals.
But we’ve never experienced such a situation – it’s totally new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing vast communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name.”
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the U.S. to repair seat backrest
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to solve a problem with manually tiltable files, according to a statement by the U.S. vehicle safety regulatory agency Friday.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the inclination mechanism.
As a result, the records do not comply with the federal vehicle safety standards for headrests.
“If the vehicle is hit by the back, the headrest may not properly protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury,” according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models recalled were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect during the first fifteenth of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the newsletter to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s stock price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday morning in Montreal.
The drama occurred around 11 a.m., on Rue Marquette, near the intersection of Rue Beaubien, in the district of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
It is likely that work on the foundations has been taking place in this place for some time.
A Mitoian foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim had just arrived on the site in order to recover his tools.
I was going by car and I saw the wall collapse with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains near the site.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation manoeuvres were attempted by emergency services, but unsuccessfully.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was sent to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change.
He says Obama has made praiseworthy efforts dismantled by Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor drone attacks
The memory of Obama’s 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student of medicine at Harvard School of Medicine.
I am reading a terriblely sad book these days.
It is a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the late second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memoirs of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical reports of my patients in the evening and I go to bed, this book brings me back to the time when politicians inspired millions of people and when speeches could take you from breath.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and newspaper presenters took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades wept with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was moving towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transition period before Obama took office in 2008, he had 82 per cent of favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it’s like getting out of a dream.
It is hard to remember those days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our army, the end of the “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I am on the verge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on Americans’ privacy, or the indictment of whistleblowers who disclose the government’s wrongdoing.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the escape of public funding and the exceeding of expenditure allowed during the presidential campaigns.
She can’t justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media have been “most aggressive... since Nixon’s administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at the age of 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that precede it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the political opposition party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his nomination.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that seemed unable to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, who was elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that had been heard for so long.
Yet, while the index of favorable opinions dropped below 45% this week, it is even harder to go back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me wish for the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses for Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on the right track and remain loyal to their cause.
“I want us to focus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We have been five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred in Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, of Fléron, did not wear a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system.
The mining magnate, who challenges the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued with this argument in an attempt to dismiss issues concerning a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether she gets leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of a revision of the vote collection system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why couldn't we have a system where you can enter, enter your details in a computer, vote immediately and get the result at 6:30 a.m. the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to score ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone does not agree?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options with regard to electronic voting and recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he would take his new duties “very seriously.”
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
“We are not looking for a reward except for the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the New York Wildlife Conservation Society has identified a new species of bumpy dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, a scientific mission officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM), returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of bumpy dolphin surprise you?
This is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
Although in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge of species classification science.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these progress in genetics and molecular biology challenge the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are challenged because of progress in genetics.
In the same way, two very morphologically close species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case for the new species that has just been identified.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific bump dolphins and Atlantic bump whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this an important discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral outbreak or accidental capture arises in the region, we might have to deal with the extinction of a species rather than the local disappearance of a population of a more widely spread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from neighboring stocks.
For the species Sousa chinensis, of which the population of the new discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene brewing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, closer ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least known environment.
We prefer to send robots to Mars, rather than knowing what lives in the Marian pit, just 11 kilometers from the sea surface.
More money is spent in searching for life on other planets than in marine research and it is time for this to change.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, according to two sources close to the case, showing once again that the global regulatory investigation into suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the world’s largest financial market surveys, where US$5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the broader investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulation of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case continues and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said RBS had sent records of emails and instant messaging sent to and from a former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was allegedly suspended from his position as European cash trading manager at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European head of cash exchange trading at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS explained this week that it had filed an action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Worldwide, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the case said.
Banks are browsing instant messaging and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest drivers of growth in investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been challenged this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the affair by saying it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having a low-cost impact on the market.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had returned a trader working in its London Stock Exchange trading funds office this week after it caused a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled,” said a Credit Suisse representative.
Mayor Rob Ford's investigation has been blamed, lawyer says
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen a "so crazy" investigation.
Ruby told The Canadian Press that the police had "ignorated or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford’s 35-year-old friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, and accused him of extortion in relation to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents indicate.
Ruby called it "inexplicable" the fact that police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair has informedly chosen not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
She could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The Chief of Police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Mr. Ruby's remarks "obvious and desperate attempt" to argue with the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" for filing a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges decrease in mid-session except London
With the exception of London, major European stock exchanges are down Friday at mid-session, led by some disappointing news from companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
Moreover, investors remain cautious as they believe the U.S. Federal Reserve could unleash its quantitative easing policy earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of a 0.7% inflation for the entire euro area, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could soften its monetary policy.
Wall Street futures predict a rising opening of U.S. stocks after two consecutive retreat sessions.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest downturn of the CAC 40, lead by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) scored the worst EuroFirst300 performance, after also publishing lower results this morning and announced the creation of an internal default structure (“bad bank”) with 38 billion pounds of most risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the forefront of the EuroFirst300 rises in response to press reports that AT&T wants to investigate a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculations about the ECB’s monetary policy developments are going well, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank, testifies.
The ECB’s unique mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a high potential for a decline in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to retreat against the U.S. currency and reached a two-week lower at $1.3517.
These same conjectures, on the other hand, support the bond market in the euro area.
Supreme Court validates Obama’s Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court declared today that the law to reform the health system ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, under the penalty of paying a fine – and declared it constitutional under government taxation power.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and, furthermore, considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that Medicaid must be eligible for a lower threshold under penalty of losing all federal funding from the program, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The proceedings to block the law were initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the 2012 primary presidential election, including appointed candidate Mitt Romney, strongly opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans at Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid a tribute to the soldiers and deceased of all wars on Friday afternoon.
Gerbes were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MEP Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinian-Israeli Hanging on the Gaza Border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday, October 31, 2013, in a violent hanging on the Gaza-Israel border, the worst incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The Gaza Strip’s only power plant ceased to operate on Friday after its fuel stocks were exhausted, the Palestinian Enclave’s Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another member of the Hamas armed branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fire during an Israeli army raid east of Khan Younes, in the south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border zone between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
Attack on a Palestinian tunnel
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made a 100-meter incursion into the territory before then retiring.
The clash lasted half an hour, witnesses said.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abou Zouhri, paid tribute to the four “heroes” and said Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of al-Qassam who fell while defending the territory during a Zionist incursion in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
The Israeli army said the target of its operation was initially a section of a broad tunnel dug in Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7, and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities."
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas triggered an explosive gear targeting the IDF forces (Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
“This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians,” Army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel hit an airbase in northwestern Syria, targeting a cargo of missiles aimed at the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah, satellite channel Al-Arabiya reported on Thursday.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israel beating" but did not provide details about the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing “exclusive sources” it has not named, the Saudi capital chain said that “the bombardment aimed at a cargo of ground-air missiles that was aimed at Hezbollah in Lebanon,” in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shia movement fighting rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard at dawn on Wednesday at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
The organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advances, with a profile, thin like a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, an ink by Henri Michaux is projected.
The body, as a simple trait, takes its shape.
And this shape will be that of the whole room: a row of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only hands and faces uncovered, wait on each side of the play area, rush when the next graph appears, embody it, run out.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done as a solo relay, as a group in unison (a solo mass), as a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Glory of the Morning", where Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online at the foreground.
This is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is loud, percussions and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance carpet, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a portion of Michaux' poem, monocord and monotone in the cree, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to go back.
This long and energetic discharge, if possible, ends up numbing and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force at Chouinard - such as the hair that gets numb or the black fabrics that elongate the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, has imposed herself, with her tics.
Result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt’s shapes, open up a broader, more porous imagination than dance.
Only the end, in negative terms, with his dancers chopped by a stroboscopic light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The public loved it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedia, after the intestine, is richer.
The scene is partly covered with gray, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers relay to play the scores.
Their touching music misguides give true fragility.
On stage, couples are in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small solos of transitions, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffons appear, also familiar to Chouinard, with a red nose, in highly polarized male-women love parades.
Loves are carnivores, fleeing or players.
The gesture, laughter and small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in coit, of beings that merge.
But the piece takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes on stage when the audience leaves.
There everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers cabotin, descend among the spectators, shine, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a wisely calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it is Chouinard's art to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to legal proceedings over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, began an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that it posted during the auction of patents that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Base Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that make it possible to display an advertisement related to search terms on the Internet, the findings of the trial indicated, which is the core business of Google.
It was not possible to reach the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that run under Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally offer $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel’s patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partially based on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at issue during the auction, it violated and continues to violate the patents,” the trial concluded.
Rockstar claims more damages against Google because it claims that Google’s patent violation is stubborn, the complainant said.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater caused the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a home in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her five-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a defective water heater, the substitute for the King's prosecutor said Friday night.
The expert sent to the prosecutor's place assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The life prognosis of both victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and was severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and girlfriend, was by his side and was burned more slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU in Liège, she by helicopter, him by ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and safe, he was able to reach the ground floor by the staircase remaining intact while the rear wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized the two buildings.
Egypt Asks First Freely Elected President to Swear
Mohamed Morsi has sworn in, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of inauguration to the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was expelled from power 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He swore in front of the 18 judges in a black dress of the court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group seen for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal and harshly suppressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi arrived shortly after 11 o’clock local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to praise the new president and, standing out from the presidential glory of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city center with southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic “rescue wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased considerably since his victory and Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work started during the 2011 uprising against authoritative President Mubarak.
“Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mohamed Morsi, wearing a blue suit and a red tie, addressing judges in the wooden room where he swore.
Later, Mr. Morsi visited the University of Cairo where he delivered his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare who played the national anthem while he was putting himself in custody.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "Le peuple et l'armée, hand in hand..." enthusiastic by thousands of people gathered in the university's great amphitheatre.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a feud of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian regime last year started, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military council, which replaced the former evicted president, deposed him.
But by accepting to officially swear before the Court, rather than before Parliament as usual, he bowed down to the will of the army, showing that the struggle for power was not over.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the U.S. braked the rise in the automotive market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal administrations weighed on growth in U.S. car sales in October, show figures published Friday by manufacturers, with five of the top six performing lower than expected.
The three major Detroit manufacturers showed a double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts anticipated on average 15.4 million sales at annualized pace and seasonally adjusted, but the market was 15.3 million, according to Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he believes that this slight braking is explained first of all by “the government’s shutdown and its impact on consumer feelings during the first fifteen of the month.”
Nevertheless, GM reported a sales increase of nearly 16% last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group’s four brands saw their commercial performance improved compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw sales increase by 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while consensus expected 194,301.
Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced a 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also showed lower-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM share earned 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford yielded 1.1%.
Renault toppled on the stock market by Nissan’s warning
Renault accuses Friday of the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it has decreased its forecast of annual net profit by nearly 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a revision, also announced a revision of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault share was affected this morning by the “warning”.
"This is clearly Nissan's warning profit," says a trading officer of a Parisian broker.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan’s capital and the Japanese manufacturer owns 15% of French, according to data from Nissan’s website.
Greece: Two killed in shooting near a local neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday night by shots fired by two people on board a motorcycle passing by a neo-Golden Dawn party premises in the west suburbs of Athens, police sources said.
Police were not currently able to provide information on the victims' identity and possible political belongings.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had argued that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers from the counter-terrorism service rushed to the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio suburb, where the incident took place, and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn MPs, including the party's leader and founder, for participation in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against the party launched after an anti-fascist musician was killed by one of its members.
Scott Brown's Appeal Rejected
Scott Brown, captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for his club's Champions League's next two matches, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against the Barça for addressing a blow to Neymar, the Scottish midfielder saw his suspension extended to three matches by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was “very disappointed,” saying that his appeal was completely justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are deprived of electricity throughout the province shortly after noon on Friday, due to strong winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The large region of Montreal is also experiencing its lot of breakdowns with nearly 7,000 private households in the metropolis and Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts upwards and expects record results thanks to vacationers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to generate an underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared with a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
Chief Executive Officer Graham Turner said Flight Centre had achieved 8% profits in the first half and that the second half had started in force, particularly with regard to non-business trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results over the year before deducting interest and taxes,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually the countries that generate the greatest profits.
In Australia, the recreational travel sector rebounded during the second half, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, the Flight Centre recreational travel sector has achieved good results while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to make a profit over the entire year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknowns shoot at hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Strangers in the hood opened fire on Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making victims, as a result of an apparent quarrel with fired employees.
The attackers fled, the interior ministry spokesman, police general Abdel Latif, said.
The attack comes as Egypt has almost no longer received tourists since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and suppressed in blood the protests of its supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
As part of the courses of English literature, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare piece, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to today.
The review will also introduce "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is expected to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other key subjects next year.
Furthermore, Ofqual, the Examinations Regulatory Office, will unveil a revision of the structure of the GCSE, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said there was “wide consensus on the need to reform our examination system to restore public trust,” emphasizing that the GCSE would be “more stimulating, more ambitious, and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students do about 138 hours per year.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the GCSE of in-depth math – as well as the greater importance given to subjects on the international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of lessons.
The programme will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a bill passed in July in that state and largely challenging the right to abortion will be able to come into force.
Eighteen-year-old welcomes children with a rifle at Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were walking door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy district visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old told police that he was afraid.
His gun was seized.
Former Gestapo Chief Buried in Jewish Cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without any trace ever found, was in fact buried in a common grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a communal grave in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he told the daily newspaper on the basis of archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, would answer one of the great puzzles of the After-War.
In the summer of 1949, the German intelligence services, the BND, assured that Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"From August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary tomb near the former Reich Ministry of Aviation by a commando," Tuchel said.
He was wearing a "general uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were his states of service with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the district town hall of the district of Mitte in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The chairman of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadistics is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
“The memory of the victims is crudely crowded off the foot,” he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who were never captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and was notably under his command Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, only 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect “CNN Hero of the Year.”
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to bear the sequels for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, so he could get any treatment he could benefit from.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle adds.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio to the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford the consultation.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty threshold, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and as many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 surgical acts for free over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they sit in vans after fixing medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to travel to the villages that need the most help.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dance and offers them the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team started receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people every visit,” Bwelle said.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive buckets, a pair of collected glasses or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply can’t afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or house; after the procedure, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It's a busy pace, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They’re hitting drums all night to keep us awake so we can continue to work,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts for free over the past year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It will change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical facilities around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances its association to 60%; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer with Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is still in the hospital or is trying to find money for his association in order to be able to conduct these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O’Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity for field learning that they don’t have at home.
“We were able to participate in operations to help sponge blood or hand over the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explained.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and teaching are handled by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gave his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not near to extinguish.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily while keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle added.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons that push me to do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Teacher in amphitheaters and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but emphasizing its weakness for crossroads, Sciences-Po, High Studies.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office in Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Yet again, but knowing that such a sacred cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, of which it has passed.
They gladly recognized in him a great awakener, animator and federator of their works, but noted that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image also contributed the monument of the "Memory Places", to which he attached his name.
The evil languages could see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a vivid glance and lack of scholarship, but incurably dilettant.
The two books published by Nora nearly two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not writing had a lot and well written.
This book should give him justice.
However, there is once again the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual wandering, the rejoicing jumped up like joined by the feet of one subject to the other.
But it is soon understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the brocantor back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the node constituting the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: This is an epoch concern.
Here, we have been collectively invited to give a definition of it.
But in the peremptory minds of our then-leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
Only the accidents had to be deployed, and the case, obliged by Jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and subprefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora is chasing is quite different.
He does not pose himself as an heir to eternal frankness, he refuses to the definition.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented with irritating questions.
This one, which is born of the company itself: why do we hear these dramatic calls to unity in a country so permanently settled within its borders, so formerly carved and solidly masonized?
They are so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, that to conjure the disorder born from the disagreements of French history.
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourgognes, Catholics and Protestants: the division forces here are very old.
And the most iconic is obviously the one that divides national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; on the contrary, concerned with recovering its sacrality and all the more greedy of unity and indivisibility as it had cut off the head of the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation of it.
And from there, an invinciblely binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing is like the four steps outside of the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American escape might well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, wrote a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinage is only better emphasizing what is our own.
There were men who had left their Old Regime in England and had no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men crowded with an Ancient Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she sowed drama and confited it.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and who have killed each other.
There is an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as many errors to catch up and attempts to resume.
France is leaving, France is coming
However, there was a time when the French believed they could sew the ripped dress of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
To this Third Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the schoolchildren everything that in ancient France was obscurely preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity has only had a while.
This is again in debate, pushed by immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of claiming minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of the leaving France and the circumspect sketch of the coming France.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
It was discovered that the chimney was a housekeeper.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The boundary walker stood in the center of the center.
And he who had deposited, here more than half a century, a subject on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiative exercise of the thesis, entrusts us, cum grano salis, that he would have finally done it.
Indeed, in a less stiff, more exploded, and more subtle form.
But let us not mistake, as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Kidnapped in Beirut on March 8, 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team coming to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defense association "Hosties of the World", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to complain and bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Military Hospital in Val-de-Grace on Wednesday afternoon, they were able to find their families.
And try, gradually, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, a former grand reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Hits of the World".
As soon as you were released, you were on the 8 p.m. "Antenna 2" plateau.
What are your memories of your liberation today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and he says we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very tense as well.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
Then we arrive at the website of the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
The French are taking us to the Embassy of France.
This is the time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a T-shirt at the Embassy of France.
I also remember a short night chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we do not have the means to evacuate to the Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua boards.
How was your arrival on the French ground?
We landed in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a bit brutal.
There's an incredible shock.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I'm coming back and there's a lot of them.
The descent from the plane stairs, the meetings with my son and my relatives, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers pull their mouths to take pictures and follow me to my home where I have to do a little bit of police to prevent some from getting on.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we suddenly get under the media fires.
It's a bit complicated, a bit violent, quite complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
The same evening, I'm at 8pm, the next day I'm also on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for a month or two that is a bit like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and DGSE debriefing go?
I had the right to a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Grace the following days of my return: radios, exams of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not handed over to ourselves.
That's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence agencies.
They asked me questions about the hostage-takers.
It was logical.
It didn't embarrass me.
How do you react today to the release of the four Nigerian hostages?
I'm listening to what's being said.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things upset me, others less.
I'm trying to share things between questions about my past as a hostage and my cap as president of the association "Retired of the World" that allows me to put a distance, and it seems much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I am fighting, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a semantic problem.
Taking hostages must be described as "political" hostages - which is usually the case - and allowing hostages to have access to justice, to file a complaint and to bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages may also have access to justice?
A court in The Hague is made for that.
Why wouldn’t one say to the hostage-takers: “You have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we’re going to bring you to justice”?
It seems justified, legitimate, common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi’s trial
Anger roars in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the opening of the trial of the fallen President Mohamed Morsi, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country’s first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial that this activist of the Muslim Brotherhood stresses.
So far, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial instigating a pro-Morsi, he is supposed to make Sisi judge, not the opposite.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses nine U.S. states of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state acknowledged homosexual marriage, “all military spouses are entitled to a Defence Department ID card and the benefits that come with it,” the minister recalled in a speech to the Anti-Defamation League in New York.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the National Guard facilities" located in their territory, he denounced, reproaching those states for violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defence said he ordered the chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-state frange began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the Texas National Guard settlements, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates that the population concerned with the recognition of homosexual marriage is approximately 5,600 active people, including 17,000 including the National Guard, the Reserve and retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard will take place on Saturday, November 2, at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump Association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration takes place on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin in the follow-up, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the prize award at 4 p.m.
The audience will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young Hyero prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he already won his place for the European Championships this year in Copenhagen and he likes nothing but showing back to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Hunts Journalists Coming to Interrogate Him About Drug Affair
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugs, according to several media.
A video brought to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging that he has a tendency for cannabis.
On Thursday, he expelled several journalists from his property to question him.
We also think that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, clearly of foreign origin while France has been free of Aboriginal cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been launched to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28," the Ministry of Health and Agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrying animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
Departments now call on persons who were allegedly bited, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or on a skin injured by this kitten or whose animal was in contact with this kitten between October 8 and 28 to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from November 1.
"France has been free from rage since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free," the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the latest "Aboriginal" case of rabies identified dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France was declared officially free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A rabies case on an illegally imported dog from Gambia was recorded in 2008.
"Rabies is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," departments recalled, and it is transmitted for nearly 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama Reverses Health System Reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that “if you are satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their claimants, the Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with a health insurance that is suitable for them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “an effervescence in the news” about the terminations, President Obama urged Americans who were receiving these notices to look for new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get comprehensive and better suited health plans for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
“You will win,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who contract their own insurance were forced to change plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius said in her testimony to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market in October had failed "unfortunately".
“I’m just as frustrated and irritated as anyone else,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who pronounced this sentence, as she believed her micro cut, speaking to an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly meeting following a controversial exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative of Missouri, about whether she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has insisted on asking Ms. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived government-sponsored insurance to subscribe to a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel holds a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky elect, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat on the track.
German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 world champion, took a special helmet drawn by a 21-year-old Mexican fan for free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday.
Vettel has chosen from 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a contest launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, from his team.
He was invited to attend the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday for testing.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to score his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his Party from the suburbs
Especially don't be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of suburbs, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native municipality of Aubervilliers, was born of the will to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes above all the neighborhoods.
My proposal #1 is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know well that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are linked to the left, but if the right-wing people are willing to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
There are only extremist parties I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program - consultable on the Internet - from many topics that are supposed to speak to suburban residents and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of building guardian...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this is likely to be fair, he acknowledges."
It is a problem of time and money.
The Suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidature and I hope in other cities as well.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven list heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I have received since yesterday have not all emanated from the suburbs," he said.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that American espionage “had gone too far inappropriately.”
John Kerry said the U.S.’s defensive attitude toward his surveillance programs was scrambled by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage “had gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also acknowledged that he, like Barack Obama, ruled on “autopilot” when a series of incendiary revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s spying activities emerged.
The leaks placed the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at a video-linked intergovernmental conference in London, Kerry said: “It is undeniable that the President, I and other members of the government have learned of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on September 11.
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had exceeded limits, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to the people that he is now conducting an in-depth review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be the victims of abuse in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added, “We are living in a new world where people are ready to blow up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, explode them and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the U.S., Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was worried about the threats they had raised about a possible withdrawal of counter-terrorism organizations due to the feeling of frustration arising from the National Security Agency’s surveillance.
“It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain with us in mutual commitment in the fight against terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chairman of the U.S. Senate’s subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I’m going to go to Europe to make them understand that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, despite the anger provoked by the NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some U.S. allies, but the agency’s director said this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations have reported documents released by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The director of intelligence services, James Clapper, justified the espionage of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumult atmosphere, Murphy said his office was organizing a Congress trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He said the route remains to be defined.
Murphy said the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “loving firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state must be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programs they have been applying themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world to do espionage,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Kerry plans to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down Thursday, plunged by Shell's poor results and the day after the Fed announced that it would maintain its support for the economy, as expected.
Australian woman appeals her imprisonment sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wrongly claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first convicted by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before they confessed to inventing the whole story.
She was detained in a local police station cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day imprisonment sentence in a low-security detention centre in the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We obviously have been through an anxious moment, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after the payment of a bail of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime she was on vacation in the Krabi area in southern Thailand.
Thai court sources said Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years in prison and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore her deteriorated image to tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
French police will arrest fans of Anderlecht who have come otherwise than with RSCA cars
French police have decided to set strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain set on Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, the spokeswoman for the Brussels midday police zone, said Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this Champions League match will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had an intention to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture said that measures have been taken to proceed with arrests and even custodians," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school commission Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a native language other than French.
This is what motivated a year ago a consultation with parents, students, teachers and educational staff to reflect on ways to better integrate students living on horseback riding among several cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of “Living Together in French”.
The Vision Diversity organization has been walking in schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of a strain or came from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we create projects so that they can identify with all of this,” says Vision Diversity Chairman Aïda Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he said.
The school board Marguerite-Bourgeoys has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who, too, sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, of the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
“Different educational strategies, that’s the real need,” she sums up.
The research will focus on inclusion from all aspects: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
