Inflation in Europe has dropped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 countries of the euro area was higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, the European Community statistics office located in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the guiding interest rate by saying that the decrease in interest, with the rise in commodity prices and the decline in unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to an analyst, this is the Catch 22 for the ECB: “We need to deter” inflation in order to no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 percent is a record over the past twelve years and in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off due to rapidly rising food and energy prices.
Grain futures market odds have increased by 88 percent and soybean price has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the global oil price rose 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 percent but in 2009 it will drop to 1.9.
According to analysts, the inflation rate over 12 months remains around 3 percent, however, in the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to lower the guideline rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December, so since 2002 it has had the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (survey institute) has never seen such low socialist support, i.e. 13 per cent.
For loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, more than two-thirds (71 percent) of support against a fifth (20 percent) of support for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the parliamentarians’ threshold: their support is 2% among the entire population.
Of the loyal voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous lower point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been so high, rising to 41 per cent and according to complementary 46 per cent the situation is fairly serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population expects a worsening and only a tenth expects an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 percent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in Gallup’s previous polls, judged the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or have great confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54% do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27% the Fidesz president.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without changing government.
While after the riots in October last year, 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believe that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about the intention to vote, 60 percent of respondents said they would definitely vote and the complementary 20 percent said they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 percent of respondents would certainly participate and 15 percent would likely participate.
74 per cent of people would say no to enrolment fees in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay fees.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stay costs.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs commercial triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year, compared to the difference that the VAT rate did not increase this year.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs commercial triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by 16 percent on average, with a value increase significantly greater than a thousand Forints shown in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already flown" in grocery stores last December, have no longer increased sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased significantly below nine thousand Forints last year now cost more than ten thousand Forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of at least 91 Forints of ten thousand.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 Forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 Forints.)
Prices of Unicum and living fish remained almost at last year's level, but prices for turkey, nut and poppy rose sharply.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics), but, at Auchan, one kilogram of bread was found at only 139 Forints.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 Forints.
It was amazing to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the recorded two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the recorded bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased it by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the most expensive basket of last year and the cheapest basket of this year, we see a 12 percent gap while the difference between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 Forints.
Last year, prices rose by an average of 1,206 Forints, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already noticed in last year's Christmas prices.
This process confused trade, as hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he is likely to lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the rise in the price of the daily basket evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than that of 2006, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so excessive since the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 Forints higher than last year and the prices of the cheapest also increased by 1,284 Forints.
By bringing the two Christmas seasons closer together, we saw a catastrophic rise in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumption items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some necessity feeds, the Institute of Statistics observed a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, for flour and egg.)
According to the Daily Basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent from the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers hold a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to accept the abrupt price increases also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, most customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-term foods by pallets.
On Wednesday morning important tails were trained at the boxes of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, revenue is less in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the expected revenue, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by improper use of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, overwork of medical personnel do not help block infections, says the chief doctor of the National Center for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected in a man hospitalized following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured in a serious car accident left the hospital but soon after he had to return because of an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to do a major surgery because of the bacteria found in his body.
Until December 10 of this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multiresistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Monitoring System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief doctor at the National Center for Epidemiology.
That is, the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we don't have any information.
Approximately two-thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One-third of people are carrying Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing any disease.
Infections caused by SAs (such as anginas, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) react well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant bacterium that will proliferate rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
In the event of provisional or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as a traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly patients, small weights or with a weakened body.
According to the director physician of the János Hospital, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the outbreak, we do not find MRSA just the one we are not looking for, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
“These patients are isolated, the caregivers wear rubber gloves and protective masks and we have appropriate antibiotics to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carrying MRSA, however the infection cannot always be prevented.
Sampling is not fashionable
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favorable to prevent the development and proliferation of multiresistant pathogens, Karolina Böröcz says.
As this infection is mainly manifested in hospitals and elderly residences, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients carrying MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these exams.
Most cases only appear if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the chief physician of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has stringent recommendations on the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines for the healing of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
The realization of microbiological samples is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks, but important gaps are detected in hospitals also in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact, however, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of an epidemic, the sick should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, save on disinfectants, lack of nurses, many sick, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is lower in a demonstrable manner or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government Project Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why we fight this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has prioritized the prevention of the incidence of multiresistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The commissioner, the perpetrator of a deadly accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official statement concerning the fatal accident caused by the 22nd district commissioner has been drawn up.
It can be excluded that the 22nd district commissioner, who has since resigned from his position, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have drove in a state of drunkenness or dizziness, said Attila Morvai, a spokesman for the capital’s public prosecutor’s office after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which has already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before getting to the wheel.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the police station of the 22nd district crushed a 55-year-old man who stood in front of him when he turned, with his personal car, in the street Kossuth Lajos of the 22nd district. The man wanted to cross the road, not passing the pedestrian crossing.
(Moreover, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian passage does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn must let pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and asked for retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident has greatly disturbed him.
The investigation is conducted by the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner initially cooperated with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional €400 million for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Marta Gajecka, signed three agreements worth €400 million in a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of €300 million for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environment projects to be implemented from the Cohesion Fund, with a loan contract worth €100 million already signed by the parties. This time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining €200 million.
The €150 million credit agreement also covers the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has approved a total of €300 million for Hungary, the remaining €150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit contract.
The parties have signed a €50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project of Metro Line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would re-discuss any change to the original contract when Hungary finalized details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has allocated a total of €8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its credits to EURIBOR in accordance with the interest rate, with an 8-year grace period and no commitment fee.
Bulgaria, the paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of all of Europe is turned to this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or and who bought in this EU market that is always the cheapest but who will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most trendy target in Eastern Europe with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sun Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but they are increasingly looking for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to analysts at Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also awaken the interest of investors and they are also increasingly buying in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, with shops and office areas promising the highest amortization rate.
Bulgaria is on the best path to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are looking at the same time to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the banks of the Black Sea and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old decayed houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary homes (since last December Bulgaria has been listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of achieving medium- or long-term added value.
The price of buildings in the capital is constantly rising as a result of increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, however, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The rise in real estate prices essentially exceeds the rise in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarians
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals will end on Tuesday, however, Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Roadmap to define efforts to be made after the emissions reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
Currently, there are intense discussions on this issue between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not want to discuss exact figures, although it was prepared to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent from 1990 levels until 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, except for reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol support fund will be managed by a board of 16 members likely under the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac es Profit (Market and Profit) said.
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment and Water Gábor Fodor confirms the ambition of the EU to maintain its role as a flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU would undertake to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 from the level reached in 1990, regardless of the successful signing of the “After 2012 Agreement,” and was willing to reduce them by up to 30 percent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also ready to make commitments and accountability-adjusted.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the countries signatory to the Kyoto Protocol had targeted a 5.2 percent reduction in total and all of the 15 EU members at that time took the commitment by 8 percent less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the period between 1985 and 1987, our country will fulfill its commitment, the Ministry of the Environment's press release recalls.
The challenge is great in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be pushed back after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values set forth in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new scientific international emission reduction system, the need of which was highlighted in the new IPCC report.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the rise in Earth's average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which scientists say would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British Army Recruits on YouTube
The units of the British army communicate, on the video sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has become passionate about YouTube: special units in Afghanistan are uploading videos of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to Londres or the compatriots upload them to the Internet.
The political message is indispensable
Air Force soldiers have already spent 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as the "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and communicated videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the air force's initial goal, the videos were passed on the net to recruit and, according to the Ministry of Defense, they were also used to make the public aware of the actual goals of the military's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs virtually nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, according to defense consultant Gordon Mackenzie, but it also inevitably carries a political message because it in a special form justifies the validity of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans played a game
The army is bothered because, apart from the composed and carefully censored videos, amateur videos have been passed onto the sharing site which also show, for example, the deaths of soldiers: in “official” propaganda films, somewhat hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never show the bloody side of the fight.
Indeed, many videos had already been broadcast on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently been busy uploading these videos.
The Americans recruit a little differently by using the downloadable America's Army shooting game for free. In this game the player can directly place the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and donuts in ministries
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a holiday meeting with her employees who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by drinking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so the power was entertained.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defense, but it is not the ministry employees who will be invited.
At Christmas, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited, and a press reception will also take place.
The department plans a budget of 25 million Forints to create the atmosphere for the end of the year.
Compared to other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transportation (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM celebration will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 Forints and, of the six hundred wholesale employees, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 Forints and was held Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the hall cost a million Forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party that is organized with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a tender management company.
The Théâtre de la Gaîté building has been leased for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we were unable to contact the manager.
Suit is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, was hosting a ball on the occasion of St. Luca on December 7.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of their rooms.
This ball counted five hundred people.
The party began with the minister’s welcome words and dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to [origo]'s question: the party clothing was not mandatory at this ball at all.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Authorities are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will host a show and a party to its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 Forints.
On the other hand, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, did not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have a coffee and eat donuts, the press service said, the party will cost only 350,000 Forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his employees to have a drink in the classroom of the Ministry of Local Communities and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will host a Christmas party in its large hall with 436 employees expected.
It plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
No planned holiday atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the time of the holiday taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20 to celebrate the New Year, Christmas will not take place.
The reception will be held at the Castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the City Hall, and according to the ministry's communication, 1,000 Forints per person are calculated for the 100 guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few welcome words from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture did not celebrate Christmas at all, the respective press services communicated to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the official Christmas holiday price.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the party at the Museum of Decorative Art.
Mega strike forces gather
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will constitute on Friday their strike committee to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, on the day of the final vote on the health funds law, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant stops in traffic as rail traffic will be stopped almost totally and employees of BKV (the public transport company) will also strike until 13:00.
The league's unions will announce on Friday afternoon the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be formed, it will serve as a coordinator of Monday’s actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, starting Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting from the day of the vote in parliament on the health funds law, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the health funds law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on what to take.
According to the national assembly's Monday agenda, it is likely that the vote on the health funds law will only take place late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, significant stops are planned in traffic: railways will stop work for an indefinite duration and in the morning part of public transportation in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the track will also be blocked.
Many unions and civilian organizations have joined the call for strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations report striking for an indefinite duration, others declared a temporary stoppage.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Iron Chemists) and the Free Railroad Trade Union (VDSZSZ) have failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, and, as Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., the airport in Budapest between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Trade Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike four hours, the Trade Union of Professors and the Democratic Trade Union of Professors will strike two hours, respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will alternately strike across the country, while the Health and Social Sector Employees Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League requires that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating the retirement to be implemented from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim calls for a guarantee of retirement before the legal age, which would allow the functions that deserve it to be put into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Train Trade Union (VDSZSZ), attached to the Trade Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased country risk
According to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, established last August, with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for Better Hungary), increase the political risk of Hungary and the region in several aspects.
In its “risk warning,” the company notes that, in connection with the Hungarian Guard’s activity, the greatest political risk is already that “short-term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary.”
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy aimed likely to cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main gaps of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and the Hungarians."
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the effect of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular with regard to the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country."
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and far-right groups since the autumn of 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 giving themselves the name of "National Self-Defense Association".
“The common trait of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civilian organization as they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defence missions (disasters, national defence, defence of order), armed, if necessary, in addition to referring to the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words of the state,” they added.
They reported that everything was going through the method that, based on the resentment of politics and party society, seeks to disguise different political ambitions from a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civility and the status of association therefore serves only to avoid the legal traps of registration of these associations in the court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighborhood relations.
“In recent months, many neighboring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and the ultranationalist political actors in some neighboring countries want to justify their anti-Hungary policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased across the region as a whole.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many Roma riots that broke out in a neighborhood of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) were the sources of the constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to set up a guard by saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defense."
According to them, over the past 17 years, the Gypsies have “terrorized” Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, the Political Capital recalls.
They added that the initiative had sparked vivid debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations regarding the establishment of their own guard in the form of resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not exclude that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in the same manner by organizing their own self-defense, according to Political Capital's risk warning.
At the request of information from the telegraph agency, Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital, said: Risk analysis is one of the research institute's activities.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occurred that could impact the change in risk, they inform the public, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere.
In Hungary, the law exactly defines holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize working days whose number will decline next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter especially so that the wake-upers can rest quietly.
In one year, we have 11 holidays marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, in commemoration of the revolution of 1848, as is October 23, which is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1st is Labour Day, and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our family members and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days on Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our state, national or even religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has decided in particular regulations on the days of replacement of the days before or after the holidays.
The law extends to all employers and their employees, to public servants and to those working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions turning uninterruptedly and in service, by their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the holidays of the year: starting on December 24, life stops almost all over the country because, according to experiences, the majority of people rather spend overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year a lot of holidays fall in the middle or end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the Labour Day to allow employees to stay at home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25th will be a working day to have a day of rest on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday, 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday, 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays because from December 24, everyone will make a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can terribly bother colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that “embellish” the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or if we take the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing problems to others.
Examples.
“I’m sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department,” a colleague told you.
That you missed an appointment?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have difficult explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than wanting to take a folder, an office tool or the phone and you don’t find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the gripper on the desk but it disappeared the next morning?
Do you accidentally find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them, otherwise they're right to be angry at you for stabbing their goods.
Don't bring envelopes back, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there's no more and you need them right away.
Are you talking about colleagues' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop spreading gossip.
Who did what, with whom?
Or and why?
Don’t tell everyone your information (supposes) about your colleagues’ privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don’t misuse his trust!
Build the information shared in you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you getting sick without just a reason?
When you call the office and get sick under the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or feel like you need rest on that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent affairs, your future missions must be done by someone else in your place.
Don't make your colleagues trouble!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not go to work or that something may happen that would force you to stay at home, don’t forget to notify your boss and colleagues so they won’t be surprised at your absence the next day.
Fredonning, laughing, phone
Are you immersing yourself in your work, but the laughing of your colleagues suddenly pulls you away from it?
Have you become, unwittingly, witness to a phone conversation that you would have better done not listening to?
Don’t bother your colleagues with chilling, chanting, talking loudly (which you lead over their heads), beating your feet, big words or discontent expressed loudly.
They can bother even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing others of a fault?
If your job is not done for the deadline, you forget to send an important mail or message, don't blame anyone for that forget!
Don’t put it on the account of the potential chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Acknowledge it if you have made a mistake and if it has caused disadvantages to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the neglect!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Dressing a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Don’t put on comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you are no longer interesting.
We move slowly in the usual morning cap.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with which electronic effects are associated.
I'll get the sound up.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes to accompany the tones of all the time, then a female choir comes to join it like a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The Hungarian music life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now, it is heard that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of garage rock ripping the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and played himself in the Yonderboi group before starting his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe."
His project (Zagar) and music, an alliance of jazz, electronic dance and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The formation playing at the beginning in small clubs began to be known to a wider audience when wan2 magazine cited their 2002 debut album among the fifty largest records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only Hungarian creators of the trend that would be as competitive in the West.
Zagar and his entirety undoubtedly became “trend” but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label properly.
The group reacted correctly, they released a new and better record.
The recently released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new tracks for them, although the title desires to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It was a line of the former group of Pécs of Balázs Zságer.
We are well with the reference to flight but next to the aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, showed her talent in these songs during the album's debut at Millennium Park.
On the album, there is a real radio tube, Mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began introducing the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is okay (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube pushes me to ask a question: did your music remain a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer doesn’t tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial music and sincere music.
Alternative, underground music can also be poor and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
A good pop song can be sincere as well.
The reception attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian and foreign audience, is either more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only the young aged ten or twenties but also the older.
They follow the changes in light music much more closely because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously happy to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
We never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important in concerts or the mutual influence is already working but it is only perceived in the unacceptable changes of the moment.
Now, I noticed that if you wanted to meet the expectations of the public, you wouldn’t be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you planning to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked alone and made a career rather in the west.
Zs.B.: We don’t really follow his path even though sometimes some are trying to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who trust each other’s musical presence and let it deploy.
At first, it was quite inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many leaving his band and taking a different path.
hvg.hu: On the list of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many have heard Zagar’s name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you have consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube to sell the record.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the album.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why are they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus the six-member choir was composed, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who were later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This song existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from that song.
The soundtrack attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody that the girls learned later.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me at the time but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn’t have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert too it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were behind on the stage, too.
Did you want it?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget a little our ego, forget who comes from, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which song made you work the most?
Zs.B.: In fact, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult tracks during the mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything got in place like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "left" this record.
At the moment, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The trader perfide to risk billions because of his inferiority complex
A hiding fraudster.
Thus, his former employee, the French giant, the Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of it.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be regarded as incapable.
Unlike all major banking firms, he acknowledged in time the crisis of the U.S. mortgage market.
"He's fragile," his superiors reported to the police.
However, if we hold to Kerviel's statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, that man's transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
“All I wanted was to make money for my bank,” he said in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income customers or those who had encountered repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he made a good bet.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
“As soon as I had earned my first half a billion, I didn’t know how to announce it,” Kerviel said, adding that he didn’t keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits to falsifying the reports so as not to be screened.
He managed to deceive his superiors, although the Eurex exchange began to get interested in his transactions.
Who risks nothing has nothing
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Rather not.
"I estimated that the simple fact of having earned 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his willingness to risk so big come from?
He came to his position only gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never win as much as the others.
“From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less regarded than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal career,” Kerviel told investigators.
However, shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz shares, he earned half a billion euros by betting on the decline of this title during the attacks in Londres.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone
“There was like a snowball effect,” he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they pretended to close their eyes."
This is when the start of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed at the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced it lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became suspect because of his leave.
“Last year I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn’t take a vacation is a trader who doesn’t want to leave his book to anyone else,” concludes Kerviel.
Czech Republic has the opportunity to earn 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the Czech Government signed nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech krones) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total sum that Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to earn approximately 100 billion Crowns as part of the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit mostly, up to 150 billion.
The Transportation Program is the largest operational programme and accounts for up to 22 percent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from these projects.
This money will result in an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage the amount of Crown 90.8 billion next year.
The enterprise and innovation programme for SMEs and entrepreneurs must be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, industry research, but also for the introduction of new, more effective management methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the new Member States among the least successful beneficiaries of the EU funds.
The Tribunal confirms the 20-year imprisonment sentence for the former president of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua on Thursday confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former president of the country, Arnold Aleman, who was convicted in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (nearly Crown 1.8 billion).
Now, he was later released and lived in residence in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be incarcerated again is not yet clear, according to the AP agency.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at his home, or they will go to prison again.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that German regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These were fictional companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went into the funds that Aleman had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Contrary to the agitated debate before the vote on the declaration of mistrust to the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted without any problem this law, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, although hidden behind the competition of power opposing government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
Politician disputes are much more of an interest to opinion than abrupt figures.
The national budgets of past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not capable of dealing with at the same time:
The first being the significant share granted to the costs of mandates imposed by law, constituted not only by pensions but also by social expenses, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle, however, is the deficit of public finances, that is, the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the state budget deficit that represents the biggest randomness.
This is public and relatively under control.
The real delay bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds in dizziness, indebting excessively their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from the money from taxes, taxes and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In recent years, they managed to repay these debts by selling mass shares of distribution systems, particularly those of energy, obtained from the state in the context of privatizations.
Nowadays, they no longer have this source.
Only in terms of official and verifiable facts, it is noted that:
Our economy has been going through a growing phase for several years, like the rest of the world, and ČSSD is continuing to settle for it.
This was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the state.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls primarily over previous governments.
We are among the countries that, globally, are the least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programs that have unfortunately become unnecessarily inflated in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, has been eliminated, if a delay in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power will only administer.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats who mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that causes regular expenses to be pushed back by mandate expenses.
The $70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really don't want the ruling politicians to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and taxes, the calm necessary to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to resolve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be placed on the currency markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are ready to borrow money.
As an example, the U.S. Fed will auction $40 billion and, in addition, will supply $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks on 11 September that the Central Banks of individual states have decided to take action to this extent concerted, aimed at preventing or even diminishing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group.
“Central banks’ concerted action has reduced the likelihood of a U.S. recession from 65 percent to about 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billion losses.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is that they have to really understand what can still follow," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
“It is heard that the situation is really bad,” he adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would decrease consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect economic growth around the world.
The central banks made this choice after the Londres interbank rate, called LIBOR, was unsuccessfully lowered, which was used to borrow from the interbank market.
This meant that banks still feared mutual borrowing, despite the repeated fall of interest rates in the U.S., Canadian and English central banks.
"This will have the same effect as a further drop in interest rates," Tempus Consulting's Greg Salvaggio told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks’ approach will not help to curb the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem that is the fall of the US real estate market.
President Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to affect mostly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time criticism has been lowered on the UN International Conference on Climate Change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
“The debate is not structured at all, it’s just a rocket of words, a substitute for solutions to current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction with the fact that his book also appears in German translation, since, he said, "I often meet only the caricature of my opinions."
Now, interested persons can read his positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
Indeed, he is an academician able to follow and appreciate scientific treatises, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following thesis: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in it are therefore normal, there is not an opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too large nor too serious, so they represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence the climate are ineffectively unnecessary.
Especially since he has the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the expenses and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers allowed the deadline to expire and failed to renew their old driving licence whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities are in the process of issuing a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid license will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licenses, especially those who no longer want to drive.
As municipalities report a decline in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are invaded by applications and the number of licence renewal applications has grown this week.
The City Hall satisfies about 2,000 customers per day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licenses.
The issuance of a new license takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request delivery within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who fail to make the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid licence will be at risk of a fine as of January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to 2500 crowns.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to circulate was likely to be fined.
In doing so, she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding Crown 1,000.
However, according to the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one risks tens of thousands of fines.
The driver's license is, he says, a document that people can decide whether or not they want to have it.
It is not as with the identity card that, it, must be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer want to drive should give their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties of detectives pacted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of connivence with the gang of David Berdych, will be imprisoned for thirteen and ten years, respectively.
The High Court of Prague thus sentenced them definitively by decreasing their sentences of 1 and 2 years respectively.
Initially, detectives from the Department for the Combating of Organized Crime were at risk of 14 and 12 years' imprisonment.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only an appeal to the High Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is only waiting for the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials that exceed 16 years' imprisonment.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found guilty for participation in hold-ups of 19 persons, the High Court today dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the accused, since the beginning of the investigation, questioned the indictment by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, police members, after an agreement with Berdych, were passing on to criminals information from police sources, covering the various hold-ups, and helping gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang returned 30 percent of the theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The indictment deals with the gang's criminal activity in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robbery, the victims of which, in most cases, have suffered serious harm to health, but also abuse of power by a public official and prohibited weaponry.
During home searches, police discovered illegally held guns, shells with a steel core, a direct laser shooting sight, or a machine gun.
According to the accusations, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other hand-held robbery Berdych and a whole series of other people.
Other men in Berdych's neighborhood are still exploring themselves before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived at the court.
The main hearing has, for the moment, avoided Tomáš Pěta and Maroš Šulej, who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await a final decision regarding their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child replacement: 12 million
The lawyer of the disastered families Igor Veleba wants to obtain compensation of 12 million crowns from the Třebíč hospital plus the costs.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
That is why the lawyer of the Ondřej Dostál Hospital absolutely disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the outing of the hearing.
"To be able to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the opposing party ordered the drafting.
We will check if it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
The amount is expected to be between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family asked for a million crowns for every month when she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the negotiations on compensation.
According to psychology and psychiatry experts, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better supported by men, although they have been faced with regrets of not being able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, however, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the news and in the face of what is happening precisely at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at Třebíč Hospital on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola with the Čermáks in Příbyslavice and Veronika with Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová with Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina Region Governor Miloš Vystrčil handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the Třebíč hospital mistake managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to cover liability insurance.
In case of failure, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may seek assistance from the manager.
Until now, the courts have recognised relatively low amounts of compensation, with the amounts calculated according to the tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka has lost the litigation regarding the brand Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was indeed he who had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
However, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not finished and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team parasite about Bolek Polívka's popularity," Polívka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
“There’s a job behind us for almost ten years.
Looking for money and developing events,” he said.
According to him, it is money that is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasite our work,” he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, it was Polívka who used the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) for the first time in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had no connection with the plan to establish a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of making the passports of the Valašské Království appear.
From a humorous action originally a business and a lucrative business activity emerged, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997, Polívka accepted that his name and signature be cited in the passport and even offered sales to holders on the price of his farm visit and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the manež program, for commercial purposes.
"Boleslav Polívka's popularity certainly helped the Valašské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was composed of Harabiš and his team who were intensely dedicated to the project.
Collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the deposition of "King Boleslav elected 1st forever".
The ruling role in the kingdom was subsequently, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, requesting that the court rejected today.
What could make the case clear is the tournament envisaged for the throne and a half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn’t want to betray the details and the date yet.
“We don’t want to go fast.
It would be something like the kings’ parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can obviously register," added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, the quality of change in gear, driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as lower than average.
Nowadays, there is on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, it is significantly better.
Especially as the combi named SW is still going a step further, I only have to think better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about head space on the rear seats.
While there the complaints end because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's see quickly done
I'm going to talk about the inside very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty successful design, my only remark concerning the central tunnel that seems poor to me.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when one could complain about too short seats or backrests is over.
The lateral guidance has also improved significantly with respect to the model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the body is sensitive here too.
The combi also sees disappear the lack of space above the head already mentioned.
A trunk in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage storage.
I have to evaluate this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear pivoting ice) and a rather easy latch.
The blind spaces are equipped with stop elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold pretty heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
The latter makes, according to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is relative to the competition a rather average figure.
Aside from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle of this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains very substantially behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I had to highlight the advantages, I would mention the remaining case underside after the rear seat backs were overturned perfectly straight, or a very low footstep.
120 horses spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And truly, that's what a 1.6 should look like that that runs a family hatchback.
It is quiet, consumes little and, most importantly, grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust jar clogged by a wiper, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's browse the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, one must be aware that we have tested a quite well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4 litre Otto engine rising to 329,900 Kč is still attainable.
The vehicle we tested starts at 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
The premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kč.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wipers, automatic control of rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try to add to the price of the Fabia the extra equipment and you'll get a very similar number.
All that remains is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools is poor
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is growing, giving rise to concerns among the rest of the population about the development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the native inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of northern Kent, where remaining and immigrant Slovak conflicts are beginning to escalate, illustrates the problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Discussions, chicanes and fights between students have translated into parents' relationships.
The situation went so far that police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The guilty defends herself by claiming that the boy had insulted her with racist words.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenagers.
The girls allegedly addressed racist remarks to this man and threw stones on him.
"When we went home, a young man climbed the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his buttocks," another unpleasant adventure described by a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints were made by both parties.
One of the remaining has gone so far as to qualify conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between native residents and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your vacation can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering you a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
Now, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
In the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the deposit and place of transshipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the US (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, buildings in height pushed and cars, belonging to the worship symbols of the 1950s of the last century, circulated on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and, in Coímar, he had his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America were leaving their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph yourself on the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still running in Havana, since the jigoulis and fiats once imported have long been, in a climate so salty and wet, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is substantially decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places are becoming more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has the green light.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by fans of small trains.
The cane had returned from the plantations extended in the sweets on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and thus you can see small locomotives running elsewhere whose contemporaries are only in museums.
Where to direct his footsteps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
There is therefore no need to write much about Varadero or about Havana.
Otherwise remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales valley to the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
An exuberant vegetation grows there on limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks rise as a candle from the bottom of the valley, and since fertile soil has taken into their guts, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is probably the place where the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar market that brought him glory and wealth.
The wealth has embodied in the beauty and the city-window character of this small city.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři státí téměř nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountainous massif Escambray, is a place so far away that even in the 1950s of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay aside.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over his head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the surrounding area, such as Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música which comes to life after sunset and where the music only sits in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this town in the far east of Cuba as the most beautiful on the island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading there from Guantánamo must cross tall, rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without traces of human activity.
UNESCO has listed the Eastern cliff of Cuba, thanks to its intact landscape, on the World Heritage List.
It makes the best chocolate, at the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and from the hill where the former castle-fort and the current hotel El Castillo, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain massif, the Bay of Pigs and Isla de Pinos Island, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practised by the descendants of the ancient slaves, a lot of this could be filled.
Only, as it is said, it is better to see once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
The lack of soldiers and necessary equipment influences, according to the United States, the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO is expected to draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan does not proceed as it should, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing protest by the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and allied coordination.
While the United States has called NATO troops to greater activity this week through Defense Minister Robert Gates, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen Afghan government authority and intensify development aid.
"Evolution in Afghanistan is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow residents to start a new development of the economy and security themselves,” British defense minister Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to U.S. military data, the most intense of the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased 27 per cent compared to last year, to 60 per cent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the southern part.
Now, according to the United States, the Allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Concretely, they are asking for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop made similar statements today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, conflicts have also prevailed among the countries involved on the issue of whether all allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as rigorous as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate,” Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
“The lazy Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight,” Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on to counter-attack by publishing a photo of a British troop during a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a state debt exceeding 84,000 Crowns belongs to each Czech.
The total debt rose at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
The government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
Thanks to improved savings on the state budget, the department has reduced the projected amount to Crown 152.8 billion.
The debt of the Czech Republic rose at the end of September to <0xC2><0xA3>842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
As of June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its debt data dating from early October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns belongs to each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has borrowed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it appears that, thanks to a less significant deficit planned for next year, we could cross the border of a trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and one trillion crowns,” said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for iHNed.cz server.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor's forecast is similar: "We could exceed the trillion in 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appears that the political situation is changing, that policies are willing to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debts Grow
The debt of the state is constituted by the debts of the central government and is mainly generated by the accumulation of the deficits of the state budget.
The government's debt is financed by treasury bonds, income securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state’s foreign debt has increased this year from 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt reached <0xC2><0xA3>803.3 billion at the end of September and from June it decreased by <0xC2><0xA3>13.7 billion.
The average state debt requirement was 6.5 years.
"Total debt has increased year-on-year from the first to the third half by 13 percent, which, given the current good health of the economy, is a much too high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by the securities of annuity where it reaches 20 percent.
“It’s bad for debt to grow, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be matter to negotiate when pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better than we expected
It follows the 2007 State debt financing and management strategy that the government had planned to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of September, thanks to improved savings in the state budget, the department reduced the estimated amount to Crown 152.8 billion.
The sum is primarily constituted by the government budget deficit, which is clearly going to reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the originally planned 91.3 billion crowns.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech consolidation agency, i.e. 13.3 billion krones, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for 43 billion krones and the repayments of the European Investment Bank's borrowings of 1.8 billion krones.
She was standing in court today in Khartoum for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting students aged 6 to 7 give the name of Muhammad to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punishable with a whip.
The 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested Sunday at her home and charged with Islamic abuse and sedition under section 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story goes back to September, when she asks her 6-7-year-old students to choose a name for the classroom’s teddy bear.
“Eight names come out of the mouths of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the classroom, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite first name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself carried no label with that name, but the problem is simply that of the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, teaching at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could insult a religious faith, “I just regret that she asked children to vote for a name,” he said, “it’s just an innocent error.”
Opinion shared by many of the teacher's students who described her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never talks about religion in class."
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most given first name in Britain, it is written from English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the Prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
Can you give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, the failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians concluded a sixth and final discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status,” European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Emphasizing that peace in the region is “at stake,” its US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to fulfil their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“There is no immediate planning for violence, but we are entering a very difficult period,” he added, noting that “obvious tensions exist.”
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which comprises the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90%-populated Albanophone province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian Ombudsman Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko will submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, have been the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika was charged with a new mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans believe their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” said Botsana-Kharchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina expressed her willingness to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council did not decide in her favor.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached,” said Fatmir Sejdiu, president of Kosovo’s autonomous authority, in the Baden hotel where these “last-chance negotiations” have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regrets.
But he added that Belgrade’s autonomy plan “belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations.”
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said in particular that it was afraid of a "domino effect" in a region still fragile by the 1990s independence wars.
“For Serbia, it does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision be taken exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally has a veto right.
"The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
“Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations lasted for two years.
They must end as they started: at the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu had replied to journalists that "the parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the status," adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be made "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush strips agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference held by him in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately begin negotiations to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything he can to help them conclude a “peace treaty” by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, recalling both sides’ obligations to the “roadsheet” for peace they agreed on in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty solving all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues."
This appellation covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others."
In turn, Olmert pledged to make the upcoming talks "direct and ongoing" and to make "an effort to close them up in the course of 2008."
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementing his coexisting Palestinian and Israeli "two-state vision".
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment in that sense from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks “a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, particularly because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” said Prince Saudi in his interview with the Arabic-speaking daily with Saudi capital.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As every time in this kind of different facts, official versions and rumors oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the National Police Inspection General (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., in Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention but on a patrol, and was circulating at 40-50 km/h, without a gyro light," a police source said.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, “not approved, therefore not allowed to travel on the public road” (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated “very quickly”.
“She struck the police car on her left after a priority refusal on the right,” a police officer said.
Alcohol controls on vehicle occupants proved negative.
The condition of the car (before cracked, starred windshield, ripped bumper) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she entrusted an investigation for "involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" to the IGPN, in agreement with the departmental directorate of public security of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, ruled out the responsibility of police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, namely that this mini-bike arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the feet on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were stuck as long as the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be the subject of technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsy yesterday.
What happened right afterwards?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, that the police would have left the place very quickly, thus leaving no aid to the two young people.
The IGPN, while being cautious, would also rule out "any serious fault" on this point.
“It’s a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, on which we need to be very careful,” a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of the windows overlooking the scene.
"We immediately went downstairs, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them," said the witness.
There was nothing to do.”
He then saw “a completely Hagard policeman, who was lazy.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the youth, the police were driven by colleagues arriving on the scene.
According to the witness, rescues arrived "about twenty minutes after the police departure".
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
“I will not say that the police did not provide assistance to young people.
These young people were rescued.
The firefighters arrived right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed Monday the first protests since the state of emergency was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by tear grenades used by law enforcement forces, witnesses said.
The latter responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police charged and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court attorneys called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests were reported to have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyer movement on Monday collected support from religious parties in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president “urged the population to send flowers to judges who vowed against the state of emergency and debris to those who swore before Musharraf.”
"Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled"
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly targeted by the exception measure proclaimed Saturday night.
In the coming days it was expected to decide on the legality of re-election to the presidential election on October 6, by indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was evicted and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is unlawful, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court rulings,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "no longer holds" after the establishment of the state of emergency, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was allegedly assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of Armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unforeseen births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, the Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraceptives has nevertheless allowed for better “fertility control,” according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Or even calculated in the near month for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates at the International Space Station (ISS) took more than seven hours of work in space to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential to the station's continued scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records due to its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools “built” by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem emerged Tuesday as astronauts unloaded from the Discovery shuttle the Harmony module, a large cylindrical piece tasked with soon hosting European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was therefore to move a 17.5-ton solar panel electricity production module, already present on the ISS, to put it to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the module’s 76-meter-width solar panels.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged over nearly a meter by a cable that stuck.
The deployment was stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
Astronauts, who originally had to take a check out of the Discovery shuttle, then go to repair another solar panel with a defective rotation system, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to snail at the end of the 30 meters long remotely controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very clever, it has highly developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor was therefore charged with “operating” the “wounded” solar panel.
After accurately inspecting the damage, he cut off the fault cable and installed sorts of "cutters" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker near the spacecraft and, from the inside, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricked" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before inventorying his tools and returning inside the station.
Last afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the Discovery shuttle for a planned return to Earth on Wednesday.
EADS securities sanctioned on the stock market
The EADS share is currently falling sharply on the Paris stock exchange, after the Aerospace and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to revise its operating outcome forecast for 2007 following delays due to the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to tackle the delay in delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, including more than 1 billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS announced.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating earnings targets (EBITs) for 2007 at the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, he added without further detailed figures.
The group also indicates that the estimate of new expenses is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS operating results fell by 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the release of the polls: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends to voters a television message on public channels, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the top of the United Russian list, the pro-Kremlin party whose overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the president didn't let any of that appear by receiving foreign ambassadors, just delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, free elections,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the point.
He denounced a campaign filled with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov said there were “never such dirty elections, even in the time of Jelzine.”
After the crackdown on the protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains prohibited from visiting his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of Homo sovieticus"
Behind these unsuspended legislative elections stand two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Putin can’t fight for a third consecutive term.
There is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have kept the mentality of the Homo sovieticus, they don’t feel masters of their fate,” says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes back further: civil society lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin reconnected with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease,” says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "renounce their personal responsibility voluntarily" which they had briefly demonstrated after the USSR's break-up.
“What’s the point of thinking about?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
People prefer stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednichenko, a 54-year-old teacher: “What is the good thing to think about?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in open access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored over 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only available for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and in a nominative manner, at the request of a former victim or of her owners.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research “in particular on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers,” says Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominal documents because of the sensitivity of certain information.
Like supposed homosexuality or the mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subject to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees process tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest for some of the scientific community.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Indo-European bilateral trade currently reaches almost €60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s leading trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, Commerce Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath said.
In April, EU Foreign Ministers gave green light to the European Commission to begin negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s leading trade partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the EU, according to figures from the European Commission.
“A free trade pact greatly dopers the two economies” and “India would improve its access to a prosperous market of 450 million Europeans,” said Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner José.The Asian and European giants will exchange the presence of the European Commission for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "ten billion euros of services", said this week Minister Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, regretted that its bilateral trade was not reached.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was worried to alleviate the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at a base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an unusual-duration offer.
"In order to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected input of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on December 6th in the form of a five-year open market operation."
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
It appears to be the first time that the BoE puts five-week cash on the market in an open market transaction.
These are normally done at a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it is "prepared to take further steps to maintain rates" of interbank loans on a day-to-day basis.
The interbank rate on Wednesday was 5.829%.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, higher since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England have been accompanied by a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound versus the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse review of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre groups on Thursday refused to discuss the articles of the proposed socialist purchasing power bill, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist "niche" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS national office including an increase of 50% of the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a cheque-transport or the management of rents.
UMP and NC voted against the consideration of articles (180 votes against 115) and the meeting was lifted at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes vivid, between majority and opposition within a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is coming
Following many rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the developer/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with British producer Melvin Benn’s Festival Republic.
“For our company, it’s an honour to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took over the bar of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now can accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as the “most inspiring event” he has ever attended, C3’s Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn’s company are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We chose Philadelphia as our marketplace and worked diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” said Charlie Jones.
“We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we got into politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
Fortunately, we were able to chat with Melvin Benn and are preparing to create a great festival on an outstanding site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded respective gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
Both festivals are held in an urban setting.
“Melvin Benn’s European model is a countryside festival, while ours rather takes place in urban green spaces,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a country festival to the European and urban to the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the holding of this event,” said Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the conditions of the agreement, but states "that they are interesting enough to allow investing in such an event and hosting a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hosting capacity of this festival is “very large,” just like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says invitations have been launched to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed at the time of coming to the press.
“Vineland will be rocky, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of spectators,” said Charlie Jones.
Her C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award for the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie trays to Montreal when no one but Terminator opposes it...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of delegate.
A mandate – “politically difficult” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the “runaway productions.”
Is it difficult to play in the “Governator” legs?
“We need to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge the best,” he said.
The race to the festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte’s priority is the promotion of cinema from here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be for all festivals on the West Side, be it that of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting Quebec films, highlighting them and ensuring that the directors do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a end-of-year rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks before the financial year closes, investors are already rubbing their hands waiting for the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year the experts are not as sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the December stock exchange generally has a positive behaviour.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, since given the current context, uncertainties are looking at markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not supportive of the stock exchange gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market feeds on the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the short leakage effect to quality values in both long periods."
For this, they believe that the stock market will have a rather lateral behaviour, not exempt from volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely drop in the Fed's rates, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, chief sales officer of BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
“That’s not the best thing,” the expert says.
The Ibex, the Spanish stock index, has lost nearly 4% since November 8 when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during those dates.
However, the expert nuance that things will be a little different this year as he believes the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution Day (6 December).
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a shift in the index that could be caused by the information that comes from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new peaks.
Intermoney’s Solana says that “this year the great values are back for him.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two major banks and a few builders "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
While, Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
Builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they do.
“ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” said the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do it as well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the past seven years, only on two occasions the month of December has been a bearish month.
The authentic end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the perception of the technological bubble.
This year, during which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw a 6.68% increase.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (for the time being, Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it succeeds at computer on its end-of-year rally.
The People’s Bank will open 200 offices open 12 o’clock Monday to Saturday
The People’s Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 are the banks located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish agencies, since it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 p.m., and to open on Saturday from 10am to 8:30 p.m.
Another group that has also reiterated several times that it would want to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to reach an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive for whether or not other agencies to join this initiative that coincides with business schedules.
This is precisely what the People's Bank is looking for.
Attracting autonomous customers who circulate in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies all over Spain in about 18 months, since it is not about opening new agencies but a renovation of those already existing.
For this, the organization will modernize the branches that it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new design, more current, with brighter colors.
Bank sales manager Ángel Rivera says the renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, as the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banco Popular has already tested its initiative at three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave Streets, O'Donnell and Gran Vía of Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successful, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very extensive schedules, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero notes.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We got there.
With this sentence, Paolo Vasile, a Telecinco delegate adviser, yesterday expressed his satisfaction, at the closure of the stock market, when he found that the channel he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect was his joy: ‘What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more, but that we have lowered less.’
However, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less.'
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with an increase of 2.54 percent.
This gain stabilizes its loss to 15.66% over the past year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reached 4,488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulated a 40.5% decline since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed on the stock market is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is due to the fact that ' we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed 1,000 million gross advertising revenue, according to Giuseppe Tringali, deputy advisor to Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s subsidiary advertising.
In order for this announced data to be real, the TV channel is expected to record a 3.6 per cent increase in advertising revenue for the current fiscal year compared to the 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, net billing for Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million), while net television revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the analysts point to Telecinco's best relative evolution on the stock market is the significant pay-out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is early to make a decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
"We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in expected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company decreased the Antenna 3 earnings forecast to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and to 7.5 per cent in 2009.
3 opinions
One.
The company Ibersecurities recommends buying both securities based primarily on its high profitability of dividends and long-term sustainability potential.
Two.
The Caja Madrid sees Telecinco (accumulating) better than Antenna 3 (maintaining) for ' multiple attractions ' and increased business.
Three.
JPMorgan: He recommends that both cases be examined as he has had 'like threats' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on November 1
Alongside its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations to develop the new law, with the aim of entering into force before the end of the year.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MEPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the activities of agencies so that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves modernizing the financial markets, while strengthening the protection of the investor, improving the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promoting cooperation between the different leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial consulting services for specialized social reasons as well as to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (AFIs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio-managing companies.
Furthermore, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that it is possible to add multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems to regulated secondary markets, which face competition with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose in the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure, and forms of risk management, and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they perform, to facilitate oversight on the part of the CNMV.
Several amendments have been added through the Congressional Economics Commission, one of which highlights that securitized debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has proven itself with what happened with the high-risk U.S. mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the management's transposition to legally define the functions that graduates in Economics may have 30 years after the royal decree was approved in 1977, which defines the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services to market products and attract new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases by five tenths in November to 4.1 per cent
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet of the price evolution in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as that used for the Harmonized Consumption Price Index, but using various statistical modeling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The NSA recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be disclosed on December 14.
"CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice-President and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1 per cent increase in the CPI in November was a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes specified in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation difference about monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economic Affairs acknowledged compared to the figure announced today.
Virgin Plans to Recover €42,000 Million With Northern Rock Over Three Years
Northern Rock’s deposits have fallen to more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12,000 million (16,800 million euros) since it came into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit with the Bank of England.
At that time, he had a record deposit of <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 million, a figure that was gradually decreased in two and a half months due to the distrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenue of the UK banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get the remaining 18,000 million pounds until reaching the target of 30,000 million.
The magnate group Richard Branson, known for its advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named Virgin's association's offer this week, in which three other companies participate, including his favorite to save him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian commune of Totana (People’s Party) because of his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the police chief of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the self last May Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'leader' of this frame.
The officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Council, and the possibility of further arrests in the coming hours is not ruled out.
In addition, Juan Morales’ lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered earlier this week, was accused.
As the SER Channel said yesterday to the lawyer of the deputy of the 'People' Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested by leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession regarding the plot.
Moreover, according to sources of the investigation, the object of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party’s nomination for Toledo and chair Congress if they win the election
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be president of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
The Spanish Socialist Party’s organizational secretary, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the party’s federal headquarters with Zapatero.
The executive chief justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will chair Congress if the socialists will win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as president of Congress, which on November 15 published his decision not to run for the upcoming general elections and to give up his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic framework.
The former minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has continued to insist that he return to the political front since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that although citizens already know who will be the economic vice president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the president of Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into “a house of respect and not insult or scream” and make it “more and more like citizens.”
“Sometimes it seems unfortunate that the only local in Madrid where you can’t talk quietly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times.”
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know how to do" and he did not want to act as if he already occupied his position so as not to fall, as he noted, in what his opponents might consider as "a domination".
A Climate Propaganda
Since the movement against climate change subjects to unmerciable persecution both skeptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron coherence.
This is especially the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even intends to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has contributed decisively to Spain being at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-enforcement, in which sectors it has occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what steps it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens' habits will need to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was not and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, actual measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening for corporate and individual accounts.
Until the hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed readerically so dangerous to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequences.
With sentences that have impact, committees, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not speak, who does not denounce and does not demand, embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as this is limited only to being a purely virtual contracting party and not claiming that we travel on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the range.
Mayor and Chief of the Local Police in Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the local police chief, the town hall secretary and a hotel contractor suspected for possible urban crimes, the sources of the investigation said today.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where at this time many officers gathered, who also presented themselves to the Function of municipal councillor of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six arrests made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation to requalify more than 2 million hectares of agricultural soil to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are attributed to the judicial investigation, which the Totana Tribunal No. 1 investigates.
The first six detainees have now been transferred to a judicial provision.
According to the sources, the former municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous parliamentary of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the former wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur of Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, and through which the bribes were reportedly made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Operative Central Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, conducted eleven inspections, the majority in detainee-related companies located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was arrested in Totana, the owner of a well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex of the Murcian town of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that has been requalified and its project would imply double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is composed of companies such as Autesa and Inomuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking lots of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of elements.
Things that happen
One.
If they will, we will leave the Book of the Month to rest, see if during this time it comes to our minds of other ideas.
I'm already thinking about something.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (certainly top PISA information in the world above educational level), the Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the review of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course has interrogated public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The guilty of the dead, a bachelor's degree student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Education Advisor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude toward Plato on what is written in the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat and stated that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet downloads:
A. Uploading a song would be a crime punishable with a penalty of six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only a fault (section 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for up to 1,000 euros is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than the penalty imposed for downloading (section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than the penalty imposed for downloading (section 244.1).
D. Participating in a fight is less serious than participating in CD traffic.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and authorless films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the truth, then someone exaggerates.

My treating doctor told me of one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less.'
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was conducted using magnetic tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images at the Life&Brain Institute, Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when the two people guessed they were receiving the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them was receiving the double, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been chasing war criminals from the Balkans for eight years since the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague.
Her mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main culprits of the Srebrenica murder – in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died – former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic are still free.
Their names are on this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's list' (2006, not exclusively screened in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who pursues the fleeing criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow him.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Auto insurance, which covers the driver in the event of potential disasters, involves a significant expenditure that will depend on a variety of factors, such as age, gender, driver's license age, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And that’s because choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the awarded premium and in exchange it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the insurance price, which takes into account various factors, such as age, gender, driving license age, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the chance of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
This is why people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower disaster rate due to their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when establishing the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must study the situation thoroughly to choose the car insurance that best suits his/her profile.
Here we will expose the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers him a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various inconveniences when contracting insurance at an affordable price, such as the poor driving experience and driver’s license age.
Although the ideal for being well insured is risk-free insurance, other more economical options exist.
The most prospective drivers can opt for an all-risk insurance with frankness, so that they get insurance coverage at all-risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays a portion of the amount of the claim.
“The portion of the amount of the claim that the customer pays will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower,” said Luis Noguera, the Spanish manager of First Europa, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but for those caused on their own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A counsel.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be cautious and avoid damages as far as possible, as this will impact on the bonus, which may reduce the insurance price in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
“Bonuses and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses," Noguera clarified.
Beyond the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to enter into an insurance contract, since the rate of claims is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
This is why it is best to choose an all-risk insurance with frankness.
"Normally young people can't take advantage of the experience previously acquired after an accident," said the director of the European company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' passed.
However, if the client is married but has no children yet, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risks, as long as his economic situation allows him to do so.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be those with the lowest rate of claims, because the increases will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be a free-of-risk insurance (which can be 300 euros), or an extended third-party insurance from the third year of the vehicle’s life when the insured has a high level of bonus.
“They have more casual driving and they have a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises,” said Luis Noguera.
For retirees, free-of-risk insurance is preferable (which is 150 euros), or extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expenditure, which is why it is essential to study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth-finals
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow meet in San Siro next Tuesday in search of the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians score ten points and they have already qualified for the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six points, and who receives Benfica who has four points, does not pass him.
Both Group D matches will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC is scheduled to play the semi-finals of the Japanese Club World Cup on 13th of this month in search of a place for the final on 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw in the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most anticipated result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning he would remain first and ensure a better cross in the eighths of the final.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it will not be able to computerize on this alone since with nine points the game is back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the evening to the Scots, who have good hopes of qualifying for the eighth finals for the second time in the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only come back to Shakhtar, in case the Celtic lost, to qualify for the eighths of the final to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without opportunities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, with around 20,000 spectators since the band dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting was 'brillant'.
Around 20,000 people exhausted the tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video in which the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s is told.
The encounter and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI releases in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls came on stage showing the bracelets that Posh Spice’s spouse, British footballer David Beckham, had offered them.
The athlete was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice', who joined the group in 1998 "due to the differences between us" and which caused the dissolution of the group two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that people’s feelings have changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls have changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have been arranged and we appreciate each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of baby sitters was waiting for them.
They have five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will exhibit in California (USA), San José (4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
They will be shown in Madrid on December 23.
The new gas affair between Russia and Ukraine raises alarm.
A dispute on the price of gas fermented between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impact on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are conveyed by pipelines, and each pipeline is strictly monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to the U.E. countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, a Russian-owned monopoly company supplying the gas, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom said it would increase its prices to Ukraine as planned as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said this would involve for Ukraine a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom.
“It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most of the gas passes,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told Reuters.
“Gas cost fluctuations would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) through Ukraine.”
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006 the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine.
This has resulted in a drop in exports to Western Europe, resulting in higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of EU supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other countries of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health "must control its foreign employees."
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve checks on its extra-community employees to check if they have previous criminals, the monitoring committee said.
The warning of the General Reviewer, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black further expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health had no accurate data on the number of overseas employees.
Its report, however, highlighted other decisive checks, properly carried out on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General conducted checks on extra-community personnel following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after crashing his jeep in the doors of the main terminal.
He was among the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October because he was suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will need to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, to ensure the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out previous criminal checks, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside of Britain.
Among the many warnings, the reviewer-general's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Control of previous criminals, thus enabling employers to undertake controls over various countries.
“Although we have discovered that some staff information has been verified, this is not done every time,” the report says.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health conducts most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added: “Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas personnel is available to health services.
Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland, said it was “extremely unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify employees likely to commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently undertaken work well in the Scottish health system and that it is uncertain whether these warnings could bring any added value."
The Scottish health authorities said they employed 1,161 people from overseas, most of whom were doctors and nurses.
But the reviewer-general stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, partly because of the problems with the identification of staff with indefinite contracts, who may or may not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for health authorities' controls in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Government of Scotland is currently revising its policies and system of pre-employment controls for off-sea health service personnel.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Government of Scotland, allied with health committees, would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report to be published next month, and commit to ensuring better implementation of recently updated pre-employment controls, valid for all employees, including overseas persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio pic on Joy Division's latest singer Ian Curts, won five awards, including Best Movie, at the British Independent Film Oscars.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a store until he was engaged in the role of Curtis in this film whose director is Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Madame Judi Dench has been named Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal"
Daniel Craig, the star Bond won the Variety Award for allowing the British film to be under international reflectors.
The awards were awarded during the ceremony at London's Round House.
Control relates Curtis' rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black-and-white film, which was directed by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot with a budget of just 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first as Best Director and the second as Best Beginner Director.
The Rock was also awarded the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple's film on Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The award for best actor was given to Viggo Mortensen for his role as the driver of a Russian mafia boss, in the Londres-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, renowned for his tough character interpretations, won the Richard Harris Award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has shot films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honor of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me access to cinema,” he said.
“I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.”
“I was admiring this great actor today, I was extremely honored.”
The Oscars for the independent film, better known as “the Bifas”, are awarded by a jury composed of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it has arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells managing an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the missile smugglers cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the Allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell composed of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly set up a group of 35,000 military personnel to protect the sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006 on the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoting a statement from the Interior Minister said 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launch expert” who infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counterband of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees appeared to have plotted the assassination of clerics and armed forces.
The government has urged clerics to do more against the Saudis led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Shiite Muslim Allied government in the United States, considered heretic according to the hardline of the Sunny Saudis.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia many clergymen have collaborated with authorities to support the royal family policy that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama Bin Laden, Saudi-born al-Qaeda leader, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and power supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five...months,” the interior minister’s spokesman told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina organized into a “media cell” aimed at promoting “takfiri thinking,” the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 people are accused of subsidizing activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live.
Data from the European ship in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as Earth, as opposed to what was previously thought.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are virtually the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation led Venus to a whole other kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is devastated by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a warm enough temperature surface to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth's potential future due to catastrophic climate changes.
Oxford University Department of Physics professor Fred Taylor, one of Venus Express’s mission leaders, said: “We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are virtually similar.
“Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, maybe even with a habitable surface.”
Enriched uranium kidnapped by the police.
One kilogram of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was abducted by Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it is actually uranium, but revealed that the goods would be worth $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Open to Everything
Mitt Romney said he wasn’t up to stand as a presidential candidate to answer a snowman’s questions.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters have recorded their questions, submitting them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions raised was as ridiculous as that of another debate on You Tube, when a snowman asked Democrats about their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have greatly reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate for the upcoming elections.
It is unclear on what criteria, the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the You Tube clips to show the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest dealing with a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the strong topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to phone when they heard funny things: The board raised approval increases when the candidates were speaking rudely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is at the forefront of the major early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
Both fighters became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be willing to promote “amnesia” (giving illegals regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to deepen this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they started fighting immigration ahead and more incisively than the others.
In general, candidates, at least regarding immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This topic, combined with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears of the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget or minimize the divisions between Libertarians and Catholic Conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other topics were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water in the nose should be seen as torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in the entirety of the contents of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure to believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked if Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
We were not expected to see Mike Huckabee, who was at the pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, declaring the death penalty painful though necessary.
When he insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus is too chic to run for elections.
The human race remains secludedly open to everything.
Mr. Huckabee’s climb to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious grant research conducted by Libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday’s debate.
These two emerge from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two party protected cannot agree to decide who is the most well-known and traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly through a message of success about American greatness bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the outcome is far from clear.
The pains of the Labourists
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Paris hotel bills from politicians, no extra-marital finger sucked.
But there is a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have masked his contributions to the current Labour Party for four years, under false names, equivalent to more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have gone well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister turned back on his election plan, stupidly insulting the British intelligence proclaiming that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped on the contrary to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown has turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The acquisition of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble on the edge of the crack, demonstrated a flaw in guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have provoked a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting the cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being a minister of defense is for them, a part-time job.
At present, suspicion of naughty donations on the part of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Secretary General of the Labour (and his former chief of vigilance) have caused them to resign.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading toward the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don’t like politicians, and don’t trust them, but generally leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister can't improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer working; the cabinets of the ministers do the balance sheet; the press searches for bad stories; and the government becomes on the defensive and no longer goals.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to dismiss Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
Problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are linked to Mr. Brown's decisions made when he was a British Treasury Chancellor.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair’s misfortunes, such as the long survey of the party’s funds “money in cash for members of the House of Lords,” voters might think the opposite.
But Mr. Brown's difficult situation is not so tragic that it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the members of the Tories party make it.
Like Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to concretize Mr. Brown’s ever-standing Stalinist tendencies, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it is not his decision.
The laws against the anonymity of big politician subsidizers are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the grant collection manager who spoke about the dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: Nothing suggests that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative flaw, but he did not draw attention to the fact that decision-making is based on something he knows well, resorting to an investigative committee on this subject consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown has to do, such as finding a standing chairman for the independent committee of public standards of life, without a leader for six months, and preparing for a good reform on political parties' financial.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could cause it to give up its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good edge for the elections; it has two years to regain the voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate flawless integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there’s blood in the water, it’s normal to see flanges attached, whirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, measuring non-recoverable or non-recoverable balance sheet shares more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, partly because of weak cardholders.
It is still too early to panic.
The costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% in the third quarter is nearly one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in personal bankruptcy laws in the U.S. in 2005 caused a sharp fall in bankruptcy archives, which in turn caused heavy credit card losses; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links of infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate borrowings are gone.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow rather than heritage value, and therefore the drop in real estate prices did not necessarily lead to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even provide benefits to credit securities issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payment fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority in repaying the whole.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and with greater flexibility to such crisis conditions as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid resumption of stocks.
“We’re not going to wake up one morning and reassess all loans,” said Gary Perlin, director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a substantial decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Be careful with the back flanges.
British bankers plead guilty for the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to go testify to their roles in a fraud committed by Enron's previous financial director Andrew Fastow changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first declared themselves innocent of the seven alleged collusional fraud charges in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They are expected to go to court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., they all plead guilty of committing fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, became famous throughout Britain due to two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case remains a pending question for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought to them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of government investigation into the Enron debacle.
The accusations against bankers, nicknamed the "Natwest Three," say they came to Houston in 2000 to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of a Fastow-controlled Enron partner, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him trick bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary as null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the bank interest from the subsidiary for <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest for this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth, these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endures a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of a $1 million deposit each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even propose its false speculation as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of dismissals, more than $60 billion in market value loss, and more than $2 billion in loss for retirement plans.
Enron's founder Kenneth Lay and former President-General Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the company's collapse.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were vain because of his death from a heart attack last year.
No money, no money outside Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts from $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
“It can carry up to 18 passengers,” said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
“Even if no one really needs so many seats since it’s more of a family-owned aircraft or for the president of a company.”
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Show, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to attract the interest of the newly wealthy Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
“It’s a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.”
“Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to roll in black gold, like Dallas.”
“We experienced the same in the 1890s, when some Americans became so wealthy and landed in Europe where they were considered materialistic,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians emerged as the world’s largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two-thirds of the wealthy are composed of 103,000 Russian millionaires worth overall $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economists at the center of economic and financial research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty threshold).
“There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that’s why we’re all here,” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, The Jewellery Group of Soho.
“Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune.”
Walking in the show on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, declare to be like their customers, millionaires.
“I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who seized her high-end dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems primarily to target new rich people, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the plugs to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum canivets, Mövenpick ice cream, personalized billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Ghud bears are exposed.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands,” said Gijrath, proudly sitting at the Royal Delf Dutch porcelain manufacturing factory stand, in front of a handmade Raimbrant wall painting on blue tiles.
“It is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling.”
Indeed, sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already moved from bright logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the fair.
Despite this, thousands of people, be it millionaires, millionaire emissaries or tourists, go around the exhibition every day.
Some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses encrusted with gold threads.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the director of sales of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips the cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold to a Russian millionaire, the Porsche shiny orange, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customises luxury cars, said he would sell three strap-like cars for Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The four set costs $22,000.
“The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires,” Karapetian said.
He will certainly keep it in his garage containing already 30 or 40 vehicles.
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said the phrase “Russian millionaire” is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
“If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in kind,” he said.
“There’s more than you might think.”
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian wealth management company.
The company has erected four stands representing British telephone booths, full of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire fair.
Passants arrested to throw bills, asking their friends to photograph them on their mobile, amidst this false wealth, or poaching a few millions.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire,” Karyev said.
Unapproved surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant Just a Little Healthier and watched an ambulance just stopped at the doors of White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another.
“Then I saw the medical vehicle stop,” Mr. Livingston, a restaurant official, said Wednesday.
That's where I realized that someone was dead.
Authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by the police, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are confidently waiting for the results of the toxicological tests that, unfortunately, will take time but should help solve this mysterious death that saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenace,” McCarthy said in a telephone interview about Ms. Arroyo on Wednesday.
“She was like a pit bull.”
“She would have done everything to protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who was working for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for the Union County Prosecutor’s Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from unauthorized surgery.
“It’s a possibility to consider.”
“The investigation continues.”
Authorities said they arrived at her home around 3 p.m.
and found Ms. Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little more than a week has passed since, and authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh was unable to confirm whether Mlle Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if a part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door of Ms. Castro's house where a faded rose tree rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian bark at the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door leading to the ground floor.
Two all-terrain bikes hung on the sides.
McCarthy said that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago, at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You have to be careful about this,’” he said.
“She was there when I arrived, and still there when I was leaving.
“It was embarrassing”
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will decrease rates linked to the effervescence of the global stock market.
The shares were exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, subsequently lowering interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the U.S. Central Bank.
Stock markets are exploding in Londres, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, president of the Federal Reserve, declared that those who decide must be “flexible and pragmatic” in their shares in agitated financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence has partly “inverted some improvements in market functioning at the end of September and October.
In the event that this hard turbulence persists, it would increase the likelihood of subsequent rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the U.S. markets, and that subsequent decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also calmed Wall Street with even worse news on the US economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil has been intensified following the statement by investment bank Bear Stearns, announced that it will dismiss 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to offset the heavy losses due to losing bets on real estate bonds.
Only 20 positions are planned in Londrès, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose by 331 points, or 2.55% concluding to 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, rose 2.65%.
In Londres, the FTSE 100 index grew 165.5 points, or 2.7%, concluding at 6306.2 adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted as a result of the strong demand for a monthly auction of sorted funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressures on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject further funds into London’s financial markets causing credit tensions have caused the monthly “Libor” borrowing rates of British banks to have caused their highest growth since September, at 6.59% following a sharp upturn since November 12.
England faces an appeal to judgment against critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are facing two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the 6th drummer for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the coaches who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, chief coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the chief executive of England, begins filling out the application forms to become a national coach, at least part-time.
Anyone who fails to win backpack No. 6 will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than for lack of skill.
It is not only in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to make Bopara emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which ones to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new executives with good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who is entitled to determine the right level of a cricket player unless they are given at least one chance?
The numbers have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket player must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricket player one day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed sure to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in good shape and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors out of 33 laps to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer still.
Whether it’s Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium, it’s just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man’s career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and succeeded well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricket player of the Test, despite the fact that his double-cent scored against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
The probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable debut in the 88 Test innings in Mumbai, 32 cents first class against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah made only ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his Middlesex player town, and that, the immediate rejection by the coaches when Vaughan again fit, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his obvious momentum in Mumbai.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently stumbled on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, England's sponsor.
He only postponed slight injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching him from afar, to ask him if he had "seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his shifting look allows him to do services that go to him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe this is the real art of selection?
I'd like to give Bopara his chance, which doesn't mean Shah shouldn't apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he'll be playing this weekend.
Buses bring people back to work, and fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping those exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has returned to normal.
Some have returned to fight against the activists who have taken them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad,” said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now.”
“They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes!” he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who has forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned home with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the U.S.-aided militia, allowed him to drive Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he prompted citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.”
“That’s why I’m coming home today,” said Sabaah Alu Obedi, 62.
Many say they have attracted the capital’s growing calm since U.S. troops arrived, and the ongoing training view of “groups of citizens involved” well armed and collaborating with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa issue and the decline of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in past years.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai, a father of three children, expressed suspicion by all about exile visas that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people reportedly fled the country because of the sectarian squadrons of death.
“We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq,” the Sunni retiree said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left.”
The decline in violence can be explained in part by the fact that the Sunnis were driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring fighting back.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and shines even by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarrian that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-deceit, posts for its fiftieth anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Economy Institute in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
Saarland also leads the children of the country to higher schools in higher than average numbers - many of them without a Gymnasium degree.
"In Saarland, we benefit from the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an expert in training at IW.
More than one in five young people get their degree in a vocational school, thus Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
Also, the possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are relatively well developed.
Given the number of inhabitants, the double curriculum panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education of Sardinia has forced the higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of nursery is law-free - a model that in the meantime other federal states copy as well.
Only future comparison studies can show whether students' performance improves sustainably.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 per cent to 20 per cent.
In total, however, the Saarland did not improve as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of Sardinians, foreign language knowledge is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise one could earn points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in high schools - even if the Sardinians are not French.
Chávez regulates the watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon tic-tac differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will raise the half-hour chronometer in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez became a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, the watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
Anti-American Chavez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chavez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with neighboring Colombia, due to a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains the president of Colombia, he would not have any relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do it, just because of my dignity," said Chavez, who hastened a constitutional reform on which citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The triggering element of this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe reportedly "sputted in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, Chávez criticized Sunday.
In Spain, Chávez is in every mouth.
A new cell phone ringtone is furious in the country: "Why no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by King Juan Carlos of Spain who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angry about the constant interpellations of left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
A decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjunction, a real decline in wage threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies with the low wage development, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomic and Conjuncture Research told Bild.
New expenses could also arise in the area of unemployment insurance for the employee.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the expected drop in unemployment insurance by 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency is no longer entitled to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
We learned on Tuesday that the explosion of food and oil prices had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 percent from year to year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind turbulences at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lightning flashes on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today brought proof of this - it detected electromagnetic waves at the boundary of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles reports in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous cyprine theory, lightning would have revealed life on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: “If there was life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should not be much living on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
“Venus may be the infernal twin of the Earth, but it remains a twin,” Russel said.
Why Venus, which resembles so much Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important milestone in Venusian research, since no more probes were on the way to explore this planet since the 1980s.
According to the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles in "Nature" not only underline the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commons with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than assumed at first.
Thus, the researchers found, in addition to the wind whirls already known at the North Pole, a cloud whirlwind at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the currents of air in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, is almost as large.
The planet called an evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venusian day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under similar conditions.
On both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost into space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide fixed on Earth in the form of carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the parties' dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD over the attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and sums up the great coalition to close the dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“We must not present a divided nation on this issue to the outside world,” Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
“Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for differences between cultures,” Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the reproaches that it would organize a new Chinese policy.
The German Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional politics of only one China.
“China knows that too,” Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained in particular about the CDU's "policy of frontier" in foreign policy matters.
After the Dalai Lama was welcomed to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to the Spiegel, also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
China’s chief of government Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses that European politicians receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, Wen Jiabao thus supported the Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also encompasses other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, fire, cars on fire: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not explode in the streets by violence, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Burning barricades, breakers shooting the police with hunting rifles: after the serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
We must make sure that a social explosive doesn't build up in our homes as well and disarms into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the New Press in Hannover.
Not all young individuals would be able to cope with the rapid transformation of social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the municipalities were already working firmly to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
“From integration summits to conferences on Islam, this already shows its first successes.”
However, it would be too early for an end to the warning.
Schäuble points out, at the same time as in the German suburbs, that there are no sociological or urbanistic problems as in France.
In the northern Parisian towns, young people had fought serious street battles with police over the past nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings burned.
Further integration efforts by the German government were required by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, there would still be a need to act.
Kolat emphasized that the quota of unemployed young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be above average.
First and foremost, more places for training should be provided.
Kolat insisted, “We need to give young people a perspective.”
However, the President of the Turkish Communities added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants also do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat exhorted, "But we still need to be cautious."
"It should be quick to give young people the opportunity to participate in work and training."
In the meantime, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
The authorities in post reported three arrests and a few cars and garbage bins burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has been securing calm.
The police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the unrest was overflowing in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The Chancellor's utopian entry into the scene shows that the coalition has ended with the bottom - and there is nothing to expect from her anymore.
In which country does this Chancellor live?
After his desolate intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country that should ultimately be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics has been pushed back by Angela Merkel from a tough and presumptuous phrase.
It’s provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn’t want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made clear to everyone how accurate this reproach was.
There was no concrete interest or little feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weight, who flees in foreign policy and even there remains in the nearby.
For example, climate protection: it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements again and again, but does not say how the climate goals will have to be achieved in our country.
Even the self-praise - having so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now she's clinging to ready-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
In this way she destroys her image of a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy issues are a marginal phenomenon.
Children’s poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional phrases left for this.
In this regard, it is revealing the number of times it lapses when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three startups to pronounce a half accurate sentence.
She tickles in unknown ground, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, both favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney engage in a tough offensive battle - and now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already bursting on the first topic.
He would have made New York a “healthy refuge for the illegal,” Mitt Romney reproaches his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
"I would say that his own home was a haven for illegals," Giuliani replied, reproaching the former governor of Massachusetts for employing unpapered immigrants.
As the Republican base has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use CNN debates primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
“It is with this kind of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to come to power,” John McCain wrote to his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to demand an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also being taught vigorously by Vietnamese veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation where drowning is simulated.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and debates on torture in the meantime is seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Common Room in Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are refused, applause flows into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are once again revealed.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney said, apologizing to the base and television audience for being a supporter of abortion in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani passes into a flowing node when asked for his opinion on literary interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigned for the first time as a civilian.
A day after his withdrawal as army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf was invested as president.
Eight years of military domination ended.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his position as Chief of the Armies to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed to international pressure, particularly that of the United States.
Eight years after he took power by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil state.
By this withdrawal from the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main requirement of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on November 3.
Already shortly after his investiture Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus meet another demand from the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the state of emergency with lawyers in his ranks, rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded on a street near the border with Afghanistan.
The Krautrock fathers are coming back.
The supergroups of Germany in the 1970s are playing again: the three members of the Harmonia group took their console again at a concert in Berlin.
For their return were released recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
At that time, they were much more known abroad.
The planned sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his own small box in front of him, his own cable and, above all, his own buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, a 57-year-old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
To the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends on his console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including a beat.
And sometimes this is inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the Harmonia group plays again has secured some emotions among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to disclose it here: targeted polls reveal that, certainly, the name reasons in the collective memory of pop, but in no way so lasting so that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why wouldn’t Germans have the right to celebrate their live legends of the seventies?
Especially as what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has been more and more liked in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award to the survivors of the Cologne Can group in 2003 for their work, the German pop faces were seen in the room.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the amazement had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped onto the scene of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an old friend.
The problem of home ignorance and transfiguration into the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only for two years and during this period, the impact power that felt was much weaker than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly worked out in Kraftwerk and eventually made himself a name as a guitarist with Neu!, which was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an old farm of the Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I", where Roedelius was entitled to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called in the trash bin was a fanion of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many retained Harmony away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next "De Luxe".
For as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered material misery.
The harvest of dead wood alone was not used for self-seeking.
The newly released CD "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as somebody believes to remember.
Rother expressed at that time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived in the eighties and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
Herbert Grönemeyer's Live album.
Her label Grönland has set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as a German contribution inherent in contemporary music.
Neu! had already been dug up on this occasion as Roedelius' personal work.
The physical resurrection of Harmony takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of the influence of the Krautrock would be surrounded with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled with Harmonia.
Brian Eno’s sentence flickers in the hall amid the singular sounds: “The only true music you listen to the future.”
There are pictures that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white photos of wired tools in the bazaar serve to the formation of the legend.
In front, the three veterans are once again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the drum, to draw instruments unheard sounds thanks to the effects instruments built themselves.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three of them are great technicians.
Even the choir of the house will not change it.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing "Aaaaaaaah" at a nice moment with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He never played rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the fleeing of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "68" is not completely wrong, and Harmonia is no longer irritated by it.
But what goes the most of itself will be meticulously covered on the stage.
Where does the music begin and where does it end?
This can hit someone’s nerves (?) or give fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Deadly Peace", two films are talking about the Balkan War again.
But the two do not convince.
The projects are either too much based on action and the exchange of foolish shots or, on the contrary, they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certainly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the darkest hinterland of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had last lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many kind and futile roles in films with feelings for women and too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show up.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch anyway "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why today's films should be as long and confused as collective locomotive driver agreements?)
He delivers a magnificent performance full of blinks of eyes: at the bottom, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the destiny and film industry were not as benevolent: a man who has had his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruin to his decline, nevertheless kept visible remains of his ancient charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Deadly Peace", which also comes out this week, the endless sequel of missed films about the Balkan War.
The film tells about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who rescue a Serb from the Kosovo franc-shooters, in whom one of the two falls in love.
Although it is welcome that here Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all evil, this film as flat as a television film is lost too quickly in action and insane shooting exchanges.
This remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, one can consider in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why at the bottom there has never been a real good film about the Balkan War.
The story of the three American war reporters, who are conditioned to track the top war criminal "the fox", might have become, with another director and another scriptwriter (both at the same time Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories look strikingly similar: two males go into a small team in the forest, to accomplish something the military cannot do and for the two males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynic with a heart, as it was introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must attribute him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, through an accelerated process, succeeds in what NATO, the CIA and all the world's premium hunters have failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge on the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that we should appeal to the Hague International Court of Crime Against Cinematic Logic.
In this case, the film has too deep human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt quite intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the good-intentioned and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous Brecht poem comes to us.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tired it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumultuous heads, but which insinuate how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan War.
Recently, it has been reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been good films about South Africa before.
This is true every time: when a star drags on a crisis focal point or on a minefield, he then gets something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Beyond the Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie, or "Blood Diamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust film with "Schindler's List."
Some films have yet to mature - those worthy of classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have in no way been celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we now also know too much about the conflicts of the world, where every hecatombe comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it delights writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or Not Being" or "The Dictator" have actually become as good as well because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we need to have the sarcastic and distant artistic look from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historic novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied, "It's all about the fact that some things never change."
“The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrific way, and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust collects criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The Mayor's retreat from Hamburg's nomination for the Summer Olympics has hit politics and the economy with virulent critics.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the appreciation of chances.
Hamburg Chamber of Commerce chief Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz on Wednesday described an abandonment as "bad for the local economy."
Recently, no other project has deployed as much motivation in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this goal, the political-sportive momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point in the longer term, "which takes as starting point another modified agenda."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday in his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It's not Hamburg who decides on an Olympic nomination, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, regarding the Munich nomination for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time frame that we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance.”
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg would no longer want to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said Wednesday HSB President Günter Ploß.
An abandonment of the candidature would further contradict the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the welcome to the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport.
There, Von Beust would have described Hamburg's nomination for the 2015 Universiades as "no substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first in the past weeks appointed Hamburg as the candidate city.
The mayor’s SPD fraction accused the Senate of not having used this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiad card and excluded the construction of housing," SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD has always demanded for Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiads and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have focused exclusively on the "Event factor".
The nomination for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have raised great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg broke against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's crates.
He who connects Sweden concepts and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or yes?
Right now, wooden boxes made in Sweden are throwing shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
Much of the eighty ten "Type Stockholm" Brillo-Boxes listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's "Brillo-Boxes of the Year 1968" market a few months ago, hundreds of internal researches at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now lead to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten museum was a gift in 1995.
Ancient history is intertwined, a chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibit samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time are now talking about about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered the history of art and auction, as Andy Warhol's original Brillo-Boxes authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum mistakenly claimed later that about one hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would have subsequently ceded to him.
Indeed, the 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 alone, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that date, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator of the Moderna Museet, examined, alongside the museum’s six Brillo-Boxes, three others from Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminate panels were first printed and polished, then applied with a white oil paint brush.
The texture of the copies dating back to the 1990s, on the contrary, reveals that the paint was directly applied without a background layer on the laminated panels, using a paint roll - moreover, it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' collection in New York doesn't come with another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the boxes in New York.
Already in July, the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powder soap boxes.
But since then, there has been an inexorable silence.
Manila Rebel Soldiers Give Up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers surrendered, the same soldiers who had cut themselves off at a hotel in Manila, and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the President for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he cannot be liable for any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to power had attacked the hotel shortly before using tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had cut off for hours in the building.
Approximately half of them were standing in court on Wednesday due to a missed coup attempt in 2003 - including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly overshadow himself with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who normally had to monitor them, apparently had deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal to power troops locked the area around the respectable hotel.
The Chair convened an urgent meeting of the Cabinet of Security.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
“People are tired of it,” Trillanes said.
“We call on people to join us.”
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the elite unit of the Scouts Rangers, said other units in the army were soon to join the march.
The regime’s critics called for a major protest against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila has been the scene of the attempted mutiny of some 200 military members against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company reported on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 percent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a redemption.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third part, it is reported on the market.
The previous day, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million on the stock market.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on DSL and mobile telephony products marketing cooperation.
“We are strengthening our partnership,” said a spokesman for United Internet.
The two companies founded the MSP stakeholder company in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
At the moment, the two companies want to be satisfied with their 10 percent stake in Freenet, and not to make use of their right to invoke an additional 18.49 percent on Freenet, United Internet said on Thursday.
The two companies would, however, leave all options open, especially to increase participation in the SA Freenet, it has been learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The poker that has been hard to predict on Freenet for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers tied to a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
United Internet and Drillisch's Holding had up to now a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about four percent more.
The right to purchase the 18.49 percent of the investment firm Vatas had already been decided in August.
