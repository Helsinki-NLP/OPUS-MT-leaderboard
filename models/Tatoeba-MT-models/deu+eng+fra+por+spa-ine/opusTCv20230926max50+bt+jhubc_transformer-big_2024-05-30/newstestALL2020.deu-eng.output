Fire extinguished in French chemical plant
The fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished. This was announced by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out at night on Thursday. No one was injured in the incident. The firefighters were in operation with about 200 firefighters.
The fire could be stopped.
Anrainers were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive, the EU's.
About 400 people work in the plant. The chemical factory had already created headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013, due to a leak, the gas methanthiol escaped and the surrounding area smelled widely of rotten eggs. In 2015, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city’s wastewater system after an operational accident.
Woman quits job to seek her missing bitch for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and quit extra for her job. The seven-year-old Border Collie had escaped from the hotel room during a short break in Montana. 57 days the bitch missed every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was awful. I got ill," Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Dog Katie in the hotel room while they were going for dinner. Afterwards, when they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had paniced dog
In the hope that Katie could still be in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "She left about four, four and a half hours ago," remembers Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie immediately ran out. Probably a loud thunder paniced the dog.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days were turned weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," Carole King told the "Daily Inter Lake" who announced her job as a postal employee to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flowed"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man contacted and said that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared again. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly stopped her dog under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled "Daily".
Losses in the Bundeswehr: machine guns disappear traceless
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machine guns of the type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shotguns, including three machine guns. The remaining is unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "frightening" scale.
In the Bundeswehr, weapons and ammunition are constantly disappearing – many of them so far traceless. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has reported the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and nearly 20,000 shotguns.
According to the paper from the office of Secretary of State of Defence Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one part of the weapon and 3474 shot ammunition have been reappeared so far. The still disappeared weapons and 30 parts of the weapons are among others six machine guns of the type MG3, eleven machine guns of the type G3, four guns of the type G36, six signal guns and two pistols of the type M8.
The extent of the loss of weapons and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "frightening", said the left-wing MP Martina Renner. This was all the more true, since Franco had hardly been found again in the course of the investigation. The left-wing politician also spoke of a "poor balance sheet". Renner criticized that he was not found in the listing.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its arrest by Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. Refinitiv's observation data showed that the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as a destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters at first, and the shipping company said it wanted to wait for an official notice from Tehran.
The "Stena Impero" was laid by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards on the Hormuz Seaway on 19 July, accused of breaching security provisions, but it was suspected that Iran reacted to the controversial temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker in front of Britain's Gibraltar.
The Hormuz Road is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the narrow seas. Tensions in the region had intensified immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with drones and tankers.
Merkel applauds people’s courage in the Peaceful Revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the involvement of the people in the GDR who went on the streets 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens had shaken the then GDR regime, said Merkel.
Musk sets for extradition record
Tesla's quarter may hold records, despite the boom of delivery, there were recent losses at the electric car company.
"We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so Tesla could record 110000 orders, Musk’s circular continued, the challenge being to quickly bring the cars to customers, and to offer Tesla as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not grown so strongly for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins here are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Mystery Solved: That’s why we can’t kick ourselves
A type of brake in the big brain prevents people from chipping themselves. This was what scientists from the Humboldt University in Berlin found with the help of experiments on rats, as they communicated on Thursday evening.
Finally, it has also been shown why the approach of a tickling hand alone triggers laughter before touching, which lies on a deep layer in the brain, which triggers laughter already in the expectation of tickling.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats react with "laughs" in the ultrasound area when they are kicked by humans. This "laugh" is conveyed by the part of the brain cortex, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed while self-contact
So far, it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - that is why people cannot chickle themselves. But the Berlin researchers now found in experiments on rats that laughter as well as the activity of the affected area of the cerebrospinal cortex were reinforced in the self-touch. But this is the case even if the hibernation was brushed.
But if self-touch and touch by others at the same time, laughter is also suppressed. This indicates that the rat’s brain cannot distinguish between self-touch and touch by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot chickle themselves because self-touch activates a brake in the brain.
The rats were also trained to petty themselves. In the experiment, they interrupted this initiation prematurely, sometimes showing escape behavior or horror rigidity. This ambivalence is equal to the behavior of children. The ambivalence of petty is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Catastrophe Avoided: Major Fire in French Chemistry Plant Extinguished
The fire in a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished, the Normandy prefecture told AFP on Friday. The fire broke out in the night to Thursday.
According to the authorities, no hazardous substances were reported to have been released. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in use with about 200 firefighters.
Schools and kindergartens closed
Local residents were called upon not to leave their homes, buildings within a radius of 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister’s sister commented on Boris Johnson’s speech at the first meeting in parliament after lifting the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to leave the country on October 31 without an EU agreement if Brussels should not engage in his demands for amendments to the Brexit agreement, but how he wants to achieve this is unclear.
Cox, who was committed to staying Britain in the European Union, said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and make this country one again would have been to complete the EU exit." Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum election.
Reminder of Oslo and Utöya attacks revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a memorial to honor the victims is revealed in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose reproductions. They recall the roses that had laid down by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud will now be revealed - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
On July 22, 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first fired a car bomb in the government district of Oslo and then killed dozens of participants of a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers’ Party.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN general debate brought no solution to the Iran conflict. But now there is one problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to get back to sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" detained since mid-July on the Hormus Street in Iran is back in international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the shipping company Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now heading to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said Erik Hånell, chief of shipping company. Around noon, the ship left the Iranian waters. "It is nice that it is over," he told Swedish television station SVT.
"This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas, and we are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," a statement said on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker on 19 July, accused of having disregarded the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members were able to react according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They had now worked together with the difficult and challenging situation in the past 10 weeks.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar after the establishment of the "Stena Impero", where a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to be intended for Syria, had been laid to the chain in early July. The delivery, according to the authorities, against EU sanctions against the warland Syria. The reference to the ship had been received by the United States.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. The assumptions that it was an exchange deal to get the "Stena Impero" free, London vehemently rejected.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world’s oil exports are shipped through the narrow seas. Tensions in the region had increased immensely in recent months. Commercial shipping has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with drones and tankers.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between both countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The United States alone exited the international nuclear agreement in 2018, which has been extending Iran’s construction of a nuclear bomb and at the same time ending its massive political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has undergone pressure in Tehran.
Due to the dispute over the “Stena Impero” and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the Persian Gulf with the initiative "Coalition of Hope" to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protective powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war winning chain". Given the penalty tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to play a large-scale workforce, as well as to play a large-scale workforce in the People's Republic.
But now India itself has fallen into Trump’s focus. Devaluing the title of “Kingdom of tariffs” in the White House, America denied trade benefits for 2,000 products in the emerging market in early June. The US accuses India of prohibitively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the frictions with India are, of course, just a side-spot. In addition, America considers the world’s largest democracy also through security-political glasses. Delhi and Washington links concerns about China’s claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. In this context, it is unlikely that a salve of American duties against India has taken place.
The problem, however, lies in another place: the empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a heavy position in the Socialist Republic of India. Even under Modi. Its zeal for reform is primarily aimed at the bureaucratic insaneness that benefits in the multi-national state for too long any entrepreneurial spirit.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective, many things have turned to the better in India in the first five mode years. But in trade policy, this is not true. This encouraged to protect internationally poorly competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even set new barriers.
In the West, Modi's adherence to the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, which is economically radically renewing his country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister is only too well known to be compelled to compromise of the west's vocabulary. At the core of the "India First" advocate, however, was never prevented from a protectionist economic policy.
Jacques Chirac's funeral in Paris on Monday
Former French President Jacques Chirac is reported to be buried next week in Paris. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, AFP reported, citing the Chirac family. The funeral will take place in a close family circle. For Sunday was a public mourning ceremony arranged in the Paris invalid dome.
Targeted by competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Athletics World Cup
The top of the world was already on the goal, when the heart-warming scenes were played in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. But in the first run of the men over 5000 meters, the two goal-warming Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to fluctuate dangerously. He could barely hold on his legs enough 300 meters before the goal, suddenly he ran into unhealthy stance, as Braima Suncar Dabue from the west Africa.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same," Dabo said after the race in the Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpected to attract the attention of the assembled journalists. He said to run the world. He was shy, he didn't want to talk about his heroin at all. After all, he wanted to set up his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he wanted to help one.
He did this on the evening with emphasis - and much more intensely than he would have thought. Because this heroicity will be remembered. Especially as Dabo even left his rival Busby's lead and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this lead, didn't get much in the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, started to make a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. Although according to official data, he succeeded with 18:10.87 minutes, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was once". However, only in training, there are best times do not count.
Egyptians prepare for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government critical protests. In the center of Cairo there was an increased police presence on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around central Tahrir Square were closed.
In recent days, police had intensified their street checks and partially searched pedestrian cell phones for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organizations.
Category: Al-Sisi's opponents
Last weekend, it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, most of his messages were swollen to protest with hundreds of participants. But they called on the soldiers of the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critics of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest had not been in Egypt for years. The video of the exile lives in Spain, the Egyptian actors.
According to two observer groups, the number of arrests related to the protests continued to increase. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests by Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) also reported more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people have been "arribly arrested" after "only because they were "at the wrong place at the wrong time," HRW said, citing lawyers.The allegations against the arrested also range, according to its lawyers, from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, saying the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: Dealers should be able to donate returns easier
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost. Approximately 20 million returns end up in the garbage. But there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While it is not possible to exempt the companies from VAT on donations, the ministry explained on a question of the Greens’ Federal Meeting Fraction, which the newspapers of the Funke Media Group reported on Friday, but traders could set the market value of unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or only a small amount of VAT.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had determined that German citizens return every sixth package when ordering online. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then ended up in the garbage. They would cost companies to donate additional money according to the current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate donations as a turnover, which then is taxed on sales.
Green Group chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decree that companies can not assess products for sale accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies would have to be able to rely on not being punished for donation from fashion market. This was not only for online business but also for other businesses.
Banksy Art on Auction: There Never Was a Better Time to Sell This Painting
Streetart-Star Banksy’s famous work, “Developed Parliament,” is expected to be auctioned soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underlines "the re-establishment of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into the basic attitude characterized by animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting will be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital until it will be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated at 1.5 to 2 million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in southwestern Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had exhibited the painting again - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29th. On this occasion, the work, formerly called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million dollars.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday, at the first meeting of the House of Representatives after repealing a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court, delivered a heavy exchange with the opposition. Johnson plans to carry out the already twice postponed Brexit on October 31, if necessary, without an agreement with the EU.
It’s not the first time Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has interfered in the Brexit debate. In Dover in southeastern England he painted a picture of a man breaking a star of the European flag with a chisel. The factory is watched daily by thousands of truck drivers and other visitors when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a “walk in the park”
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in parliament, according to his top adviser, do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the 2016 election campaign before the Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park," Dominic Cummings said at a book presentation on Friday. "We will enjoy this (we will leave the EU).
Johnson had harshly attacked Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them of, among other things, “treason” to the people, accusing him of putting MPs at risk because they could be targeted by murder threats, he declared himself a “humbug.”
Cummings said that the only way to get rest is if MEPs finally respect the decision of the British to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that Britain had not left the EU three years after the referendum.
Even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint on Friday in the face of the burdened mood. "We should speak to each other with respect," it said in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistani Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at his first appearance before the UN General Assembly.
Otherwise, a re-war between Pakistan and India would be likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If it goes bad, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each dominate part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China. In early August, India had withdrawn its autonomy from the Indian Kashmir region, thereby sharply increasing tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egypt’s President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government responds with a hard hand. It shoots the population with sharp ammunition, more than 2,000 arrested people join prisons among the 60,000 political prisoners already incarcerated there. It has never been safe to avoid protesting in Egypt. But since the assumption of power of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, a State assembly has done for it.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being suffocated by its own government threw millions on the streets. And that’s a problem that the el-Sisi regime doesn’t get over, no matter how hard it goes against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, one-third of the Egyptian market lives below the poverty threshold. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide whom to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor.
Tüv exams in terminal: BER-Chief: No more "showstoppers" for capital airport
Two months were checked to see if the complex plant mesh works in interaction with the BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the course, but the tube is not finished at the BER.
Following large-scale TÜV tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year, this is certain, Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the control body.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed examination, but also said there are still defects to work out in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real show stopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is no longer likely to be too large. The construction completion announcement is now scheduled to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year.
"In order to create the conditions for starting operations, there is a need to continue to work intensively on addressing the shortcomings," the company said in a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is no release yet for all dowels on which the cable roads hang. The airport chief expects it to be available by the end of the year.
Furthermore, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal does not work satisfactorily. The problems had already led to a further crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke aprons that go down in a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. 36 engines therefore need to be replaced. Then there will be new attempts with hot gas smoke early this year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree defects as well as planning faults have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally it was expected to go into operation in 2011. The costs have increased since the beginning of construction 2006 from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros expected to open next year.
Because the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the officials are planning to expand the airport, which is why it is scheduled to take place at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on October 18, as Chairman Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance chief Heike Fölster moves to Deutsche Railway at the end of the year, staff chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster for putting the airport finances on a solid foot.
Chemnitz: ATMs for drugs exploded - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs - and threw out several machines in the Chemnitzer district! Now the perpetrator is finally in prison!
In the past two years, the number of exploded cigarette and parking ticket machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, police caught a 33-year-old German on the Bürgerstraße and on the Further Straße in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the cause of explosive explosions in the crime unit with particularly serious case of theft led by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed."
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "With the prey he apparently financed his narcotic addiction." Only four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber had exploded parking cars on the Bürgerstraße.
The total damage incurred amounts to at least 60,000 euros!
The machine bomber is now in custody, and police investigations are ongoing.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for further machine explosions in Chemnitz and neighboring districts.
AUA acquires Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is re-creaming its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the midst of the price battle with cheap airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa’s subsidiary AUA takes over “the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna,” an Austrian Airlines press spokesman told APA on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa Billigflieger Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Four of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from Vienna from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings personnel. In the future, three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Germany, which will be from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter engines.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman said. Flight times should be matched for connecting flights. The goal is, on the one hand, to strengthen the hub in Vienna and, on the other hand, to expand decentralized transport from the federal states.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings serves in Vienna only as a "Production Company" for the Group's sister AUA. So, among other things, the Barcelona and Rome would be served with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings device. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings under AUA.
A price battle broke out at Vienna airport after the Niki bankruptcy. Ryanair's subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it will increase its fleet in Vienna to 16 planes next summer. The Irish low-cost aircraft sends four Ryanair aircraft and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wet Lease".
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary's statement that Lauda will have surpassed the AUA in five years, said Andreas Otto, CEO of AUA on Friday: "We will remain number one at the site, in five, six or ten years."
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was reported to have stopped at the Italian holidays at the beginning of the month at the hands of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31), the palace announced on Thursday.
“We’re so excited to announce our engagement, we’re both so excited to start this adventure together and can’t wait to be really married,” the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in the official release.
“We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us a lot in the years to come full of love and happiness.”
Sister Eugenie knipped the pictures
The official engagement photos have been recorded by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also published on her Instagram account.
A royal festival
The wedding is scheduled to take place in 2020. More information on the date, place and everything else the palace will announce in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the marriage of the number nine of the British throne succession and the real estate mogul will be a similarly large celebration as the marriage of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study of Causes of Heart Diseases
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really triggers a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburg researchers now want to look closely at the inherited material of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
The analysis of the inherited material of 9,000 people will help Hamburgers and Swiss scientists identify the causes of cardiovascular diseases in more detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking region, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne-Stiftung funds the project with €12.5 million. From Switzerland, the Davos High Mountain Clinic, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the key influencing risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. The interaction between genes and external influences is inadequately known, it said. Now scientists want to compare the entire vascular material of 8,000 UK healthy people with that of the 1,000 former patients at the University of the Heart.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes are known to potential disease-causing changes in DNA - so-called mutations - said the clinic.
According to the five-year project, the aim of the initiators is to develop new options such as the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythms, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be useful in the study of other popular diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University’s heart and vascular center, as well as the interaction between heart, brain and heart.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also emphasized that there was a strong willingness to use the data also for the exploration of other diseases. The Clinic of the Foundation in Davos treats primarily allergies so far. Now living on the medical campus there, Switzerland was to create a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and a professorship of bioinformatics to be created in his commitment.
The biosamples of the healthy participants are from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, this is the largest local health study in the world according to the clinic. In heredity decryption, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymized data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabytes) of the University of Zurich, said Holger.
Today, according to UKE, the inheritance of a person can be decrypted within 24 hours. The pure in-house cost for this was 1300 euros. The world’s first gene sequencing, the results of which were published in 2001, still cost several hundred million euros. The study is scheduled to begin on 1 October, all 9,000 samples are expected to be analyzed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian Police Free Hundreds of Maltreated Boys
In Nigeria, police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to clues from local residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of which were still minors, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused. Some of them said they were raped by their teachers."
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught in the Qur'an and being "improved," in fact, the protectors were held by their teachers under "most degrading and inhumane conditions," Sabo said. About a hundred students, including children aged nine, had been chained in a small room.
According to the information, the Koran school had existed for about ten years. Local residents had alerted the authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility. Parents were shocked when they were taught about the states in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had no idea of their children's suffering. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often inadequate state institutions. People in the region are suffering from frequent attacks by armed gangs. According to the UN refugee aid agency, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border to the neighboring state of Niger in the last ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
"Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in Kaduna.
The children were discovered there Thursday after a notice in an Islamic school, where the conditions were "inhumane". Officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were kept as slaves and chained in their schools, and some were sexually abused. Television pictures showed lost weight and wounded students in a recognizably poor health condition.
World Football Election: More Accusations for Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Milan, the FIFA World Football Association awards the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi, it is the sixth honour and thus the record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he never voted in the World Football election, accusations came from other countries to FIFA. Egypt was not counted at all - with a curious reason.
Much of the FIFA has proven to be appreciative in recent years: the World Cup awards, doubtful plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. However, the FIFA World Footballer's election has not yet been suspicious of running unclean - if you do not consider the national vote to be unclean.
But after Nicaragua’s captain complained that he did not vote at all, there are now further disagreements: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account; in fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
FIFA apologises for the fact that "the signatures on the election forms were submitted in large letters and therefore not valid" and that the Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudan’s coach is also amazed
There is also a scream from Sudan regarding the election. While the situation in the case of Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese association states that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally rated: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to FIFA, the vote was the same with Stepel of Verdam.
Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera said: “I didn’t vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details of my voice are wrong, thank you,” he wrote. In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted on his behalf.
The Association received a message on Friday: It was true, but of course it was not intentional. The completed election documents were "erroneously" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, as the official vote of the list, as was stated in a statement by the Federation.
The other cases are now being examined by FIFA in an investigation, but it emphasizes that the election process was supervised externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers, while Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine affair: Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly voted for an official investigation against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads to the President, it can be determined by the facts that will be determined." He wants to know more about the pre-whisle-blowing.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly in a phone call called upon Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the activities of Democratic Presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair, but few have shown discomfort. Scott’s remarks are now a first sign of this in Trump’s party, the moderate governor of Virginia had already repeatedly opposed Trump’s policy, such as loosening environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
As another high-ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, spoke for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and go to the ground."
Scott and Baker, as governors of the U.S. states, formally did not participate in the proceedings against Trump, which are being decided in Congress. Therefore, their comments are especially symbolically important. Nevertheless, the first senators of the Republicans have also criticized the situation. For example, Mitt Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said the case "is".
The affair could lead to the initiation of a lifting proceedings against Trump, and the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, accusing him of abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for his own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the impeachment procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could endeavour to a so-called impeachment. But the decision on actual impeachment was made in the Senate, where Trump’s Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a process are therefore small. So far, no US president has been impeached by a impe.
Are torturers on board of Rackete's "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had taken the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees on board unlawfully to the port of Lampedusa. After heavy protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - was raised her home arrest after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now there are new serious accusations against rackets. Thus, three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3" of the newspaper. The suspects have not been caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognised their torturers in Italy.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was about Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and exposed to atrocities - by repeated and repeated.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships."
Italy’s former right-wing Interior Minister Matteo Salvini called for an apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk sets for Tesla delivery record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost with the prospect of new record numbers on the stock market.
“We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries,” Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrorek.
The demand was strong, so Tesla could record 110,000 orders, Musk’s circular continued, the challenge being to quickly bring the cars to the customers, and to offer Tesla as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla’s shares went out of trade with an increase of more than six percent. The price has not grown so strongly for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins here are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
U.S. budget dispute: Only bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed on an increase in spending ceilings for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021 in August, the United States is still there before the new fiscal year starting on October 1, without spending plans. The Senate has followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21st. Without such a decision it would be in Shudown.
Avoid Shutdown
For the time being, the federal administration is now funded at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the spending plans for the fiscal year 2019 ending Monday. This is because Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 spending laws that allocate the funds to the different departments and authorities. Therefore, for the time being, the federal administration cannot benefit from the expenditure extended for the new fiscal year from 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion dollars.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans.
The spirits divorce mainly on the topic of resources allocation for the area of internal security and border security. In the Senate apparently the Republicans are trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump’s major priorities. The Democrats are disrupting the wall plans and their financing, which had actually been planned for other military buildings and projects.
At the wall building the ghosts divorce
Currently, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this issue. More likely than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the coming seven weeks, an extension of the transitional financing beyond November 21st is not excluded.
Against the background of the ongoing inability of the Congress to agree on the twelve spending laws in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown gain ideas for automating the process in popularity.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is expected to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill that allows all women to use in vitro fertilization, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
The proposal still requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp warned that in the future numerous "children without a father" could grow up. The French Bishops' Conference is also against innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defended as a "chance" for society. It forms the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial fertilization for all women are to be borne by social security.
Fertilization with sperm of dead husband continues to be prohibited
On the other hand, with a narrow majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband for artificial fertilization. In Belgium, Spain and Britain, artificial fertilization is permitted "post-mortem". In Germany, there were in the past cases in which women argued in vain on the issue of the sperm of a deceased.
On the other hand, numerous deputies of President Emmanuel Macron’s La République en Marche (Republic in motion, LREM) and members of the opposition voted for artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be imposed a “double grief” if her child’s desire remained unfulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow may be able to be fertilized in the future with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial fertilization is only permitted in France for heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that surrogacy would continue to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women – however, it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for flight fee for Unis become louder
There is a lot flying at universities. That is why the country wants to also have a climate tax there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also be restricted when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The delayed discussion on a climate tax on flights from universities and universities comes back in swing. After the Landesrectors Conference was still skeptical about a corresponding move from the green-black coalition, the first debate of these plans is now being received broad support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg and one of the Pächer universities.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB, the detainees were reported to have illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. At the time there was a fire change between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and one North Korean were injured, the fisherman later killed his serious injuries.
Communist North Korea is suffering from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian Coast Guard is patroling to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 inkfish seized
In the re-controls, 30,000 inkfish were discovered and seized on the boats, and three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia’s fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been temporarily arrested there this year, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern Primorje region, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained of high ecological damage from the North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also be removed from the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they would need for 200 years.
Only 18,000 more: U.S. lowers asylum ceiling
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is standing against seekers of protection: as the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal migration of refugees will be further lowered. In the future, mainly threatened believers and Iraqis will be given asylum.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low limit for the reception of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, no more than 18,000 people will be allowed into the country, as the U.S. State Department said. In the nearly ended marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
In recent years, President Donald Trump’s administration has drastically lowered the readiness to receive seekers from all over the world. Under the predecessor Barack Obama’s administration, there had been much higher admission limits.
The requested ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee program in 1980, but the Foreign Ministry described the U.S. as “the most merciful and generous nation in history,” a wording that strongly reminds of the current U.S. president’s language usage.
A "responsible dealing" with refugees aims at allowing refugees to return to their homelands to help with reconstruction, Trump said. For his harsh course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from supporters, but there is also massive criticism.
A major point of dispute is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal. To be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency State. Whether there is a time link between the current measure and current domestic developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selenskyi affair and a possibly threatening official proced.
The U.S. government wants to focus on receiving two groups of refugees in the future: people persecuted for their faith – and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus endangered, according to the statement of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs, with a maximum of 1,500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
In particular, the United States wants to get people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to apply for asylum in other countries, with the United States only signing migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the U.S. southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
At the request of the Argentinian judiciary, an orang-uthan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a collecting station for human monkeys in the United States. The "Sandra" was born in 1986 at the Rostock Zoo and was granted the rights of a "non-human person". That is why their release was mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight, but not as a passenger.
As the 53 kilograms weighing human bells are unable to adapt to wildlife, they are expected to live in the outdoors of the Center for Great Apes in Florida, where 21 more orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed, including "Bubbles", formerly a pop star by US Jackson.
After her birth, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen in Rostock, before she was moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process for "Sandra" fundamental rights has helped to transform the Zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark. By 2023, the Zoo is to be a research and education site.
Record for Swiss extreme mountaineers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new husar ride on the nearly 3,000-metre high Great Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without net, double soil or other aid, the Swiss overcame the 550 meters high northern wall of the Great Tin in a new record time.
Dressed with jeans, t-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, thus undercutting the old top mark by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in the Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, US sports goods manufacturer Nike recorded a significant gain. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion in the last quarter (nearly $1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year period, the group reported on Tuesday. The reason for this is mainly the new direct marketing strategy of AdKone Direct.
Revenues rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August, the biggest increase in Nike sales in China with a 22 percent increase, which also benefited the Beaverton Group in the Oregon People’s Republic from its approach to targeting consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nike will further advance the sportswear manufacturer’s “digital transformation” and thus expand its competitive advantage. Investors reacted with pleasure to quarterly figures – the sportswear manufacturer’s shares increased by more than five percent.
Stadium ban for life due to racism in Italy
Due to racist comments on football professional Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club of the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil was scoffed by the fan on Instagram in 2016. Jesus was to post the private news and urged his club to take action. "@officiallasroma Rome you know what to do with a fan, you already know with the #NoacJ
The club responded late Thursday, reporting the fan’s account on Instagram and the police, and the Roma supporters were never allowed to visit a match of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scandal racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify the responsible and throw out of the stadiums," said the FIFA president Gianlas Infantus at the Bergtal.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 fans of the record champion Juventus Turin. Four of them are expected to no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, police said. For the rest, bans apply from four to seven years.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of ultra fan groups around Juventus. The twelve are accused of severe blackmail, money laundering and private violence. The club had launched the investigation with a charge last year.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra leaders are supposed to be behind black ticket trading, “militaryly controlling” the ticket trading for the fan curve, and they are supposed to have blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political - whole vintages are considered with graspful terms. If you look closer, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well these labels describe the respective lifestyle of young people?
With this call, on September 21st, officially started crab catching on Lake Gucheng in Gaochun, which also launched the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Department of Public Relations of the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothill of Nanjing in Jiangsu province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "slow city" in China and here is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "slow city" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields".
The people of Gaochun have already begun crab farming in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a shaping industry that has provided high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively supported the agriculture of the agricultural and scientific development of crab farming.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distribute power, optimize administration and government services" and carefully set up the service network for "approvals under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for lending" to fully optimize the environment for approvals, services and development.
Gaochun takes advantage of the on-site benefits by connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui fully and enjoys the development zone and its position as an international "slow city" as a landmark for all intelligent high-end production companies, biomedical and medical technology companies, for energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors and for organic agriculture.
Iran-U.S. Conflict: Ruhani Speaks of End of Sanctions - Trump Contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke of an alleged U.S. proposal to lift sanctions after his return from the U.N. General Assembly, in exchange for talks with the Tehran leadership, the United States envisaged an end to all sanctions, Ruhani said on his official website.
President Donald Trump, however, tweeted: “Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there is a meeting. I said, of course, no.”
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and would have pushed for a meeting to take place. "And America says I am lifting sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of sanctions that should be stopped have been clearly admitted to debate.
However, Ruhani criticized that this move was not in an acceptable manner, but that given the penalties in force and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one can predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed hope at the edge of the UN General Assembly that Ruhani would meet Donald Trump.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 rebounds
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes in the shortest possible time, fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake the day before, there have been nearly 200 afterquakes, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the marmara region outside Istanbul and triggered panic in the million metropolis. Now the government intends to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year poorly built residential houses fall down - among other things made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces registered in the center as a refuge have been built for a long time. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Beben in August, the Istanbul Chamber of Engineering warned that an estimated one million buildings in Istanbul are not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of Thursday’s earthquake was located in the Marmara Sea in front of the district of Silivri and at about seven kilometers of depth, according to the Afad Civil Protection Agency.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu tweeted that no injuries or damage were reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for security reasons. Some students cryed, as seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul. At the time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could threaten, but when the earthquake will occur is unclear. The earthquake on Thursday struck the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need, standing next doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth shakes. When the next big earthquake will come, it is unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu tracked developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom), according to whom two minarets of mosques collapsed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Warning of post-quake in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings were shaking. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines had been interrupted. It was harsher than Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Halfmoon, Kerem Clinic, warned via Twitter of post-quake. He called on people to stay away from buildings to avoid visible damage.
According to official data, the time of the earthquake is indicated at 13.59 a.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first earthquake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a post-quake, which was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the Richter scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of the magnitude 4.6 shaken the Turkish marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the civil protection agency Afad announced on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that created headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high - and scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and will cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. It has become more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a bigger earthquake," Ersoy said. "Sooner or later the big earthquake will also come."
There had been an incident a few weeks ago - the earthquake also caused great concerns in Istanbul. Also, there had been a heavy earthquake in Albania only a few days ago - there were 68 injuries. Even this year on Lake Constance the earth had struck.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine affair
Two brisant documents provide for new ignition in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment proceedings, the US Democrats see strengthened: the complaint filed by an anonymous reporter about Trump and his controversial phone call with the President of Ukraine.
United Airlines Passenger Incarcerated in Toilet - Flight Redirected
Because a passenger was imprisoned in the board toilet, a flight was redirected by United Airlines and the toilet door was blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline said.
At an off-plan landing in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time), the woman was eventually released from the narrow cabin. About an hour she was imprisoned in it, the US media wrote, citing other passengers. For the flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the aircraft.
In a video released on the Internet, according to the U.S. media from Flight 1554, you can see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, OK?" says a man. The airline apologized to all passengers. First was open whether the woman would receive compensation.
The Cockroach: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka’s famous narrative “The Transformation,” British successful author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenes publisher (Zurich) announced. It is not about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams". No one has been ignored or hated in his previous life, but now at once is the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as the people's mission.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If the parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment, if ministers are lying shamelessly like the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteers in high positions appeared to just beg the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer must first ask himself what he can do."
Kafka's first-ever narrative, published in 1915, is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and looks "to an enormous pests", is gradually excluded by family and society and eventually perishes. "Ian McEwan bows down to Kafka to describe a world that stands head," Diogenes' publisher said.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria’s railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary will receive whisper brakes to reduce noise from freight trains, as well as sections of the rail connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna Neustadt and Sopron will be modernized and electrified.
This will make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, according to the EU’s Connecting Europe Facility.
Thomas Cook: All trips canceled until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook canceled all trips until October 31, 2019, a day after his insolvency application. Travel could not be initiated "for insolvency reasons," the company announced on Thursday night.
This also affected bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, it said that the further procedure would be reviewed.
Thomas Cook in Germany had fallen into the bankruptcy of the British parent group and had filed an insolvency application on Wednesday. The company, which includes Neckermann Reisen, Öger Tours and Bucher Reisen, employs approximately 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels back from now on
On the other hand, from Friday, hotels abroad, which are currently home to Thomas-Cook holidaymakers, will receive money from Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidaymakers will no longer be asked for extra payments, according to Zurich.
Based on the booking information and without submitting separate invoices, the hotels in the resorts will now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas-Cook travellers from these hotels will not be asked to pay individual hotel bills from now on or otherwise."
The insurance company responded to reports from hotel guests who, according to their own data, had been forced to pay for their accommodation on the grounds themselves. Some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Headquarters had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected will be voted with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said. According to Thursday, there were 70,000 Thomas-Cook package holidays travelling from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured vacation and return trip of the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced withdrawals from Zurich Insurance will only help those travellers who are still traveling. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. Late Thursday evening, the company announced that all trips until and including 31 October would be cancelled. This also applies for such bookings that are already paid.
As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it said. In principle, Zurich insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could find out on the Kaera website about ways to refund the travel price and make their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys mine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's engagement, and now in Africa he is walking straight in the footsteps of his mother.
Wearing a blue splinter protective vest, British Prince Harry has set off and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola.
Close to a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, on Friday morning he made the circle of ignition in front of ongoing TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savannah landscape without harm. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict, there are still more than 1,000 mines.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to follow the path she went. The pictures on which Princess Diana walked through a cleared mine field in 1997 had gone around the world. She also had support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a 10-day African trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations: the danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly determined that he will not guarantee a third delay of Brexit negotiations. But what statements are forever excluded by the polarizing British. Johnson's recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Britain had been renewed from the fall of a Damokles sword over the blondshed. His suspension of Parliament to carry out his Brexit course to the exitance date.
Boris Johnson says deal is possible.
However, the pressure seems not to pass noticeably from Johnson, who, while visiting a hospital, suggested that in the event of a non-deal by the end of October, he would support an extension of the negotiations:
You know, we'll stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm carefully optimistic that it works.
And the time is gradually running away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. About six weeks still the EU and the UK negotiators have time to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But even the recent talks could not make a breakthrough again.A Brexit agreement by the end of OctoberSeems rather difficult to imagine.
U.S. Authority: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has risen to twelve. In addition, there are now 805 confirmed and likely injured in this connection, the US health agency CDC announced. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have already been more than 900 fully affected, about 500 of which are still confirmed.
Fear of new protests in Egypt is growing
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in millions of times on online networks. The contractor and actor living in Spain calls for a "People's Revolution". For today's Friday he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass protests with a million participants in the country's central seats.
The security authorities are alarmed in any case. In the center of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around central Tahrir Square were blocked. In recent days, police had intensified their street checks and partially searched pedestrian cell phones for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. Such an open protest had not been in Egypt in years. Accordingly, the security forces responded harshly. According to Human Rights Watch (HRW), nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been "arbitrary arrested" because they "have been in Egypt.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after he toppled partially elected Islamist President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been detained in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland expedition back
Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition and was greeted at his arrival in the port of Hamburg by skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg, who carried the racing yacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists over the past few months, Fuchs had examined and documented the consequences of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar scholar. He had been waiting for years for the young generation to speak out. Many have known for decades that the Earth is warming up. Nevertheless, many acted as if there were a Planet B.
"What happens on the sea often happens without the public," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the debris of the seas. The expedition was measured, among other things, with a drone of Greenland glacier ice and fished with nets for microplastic.
For his "struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world seas", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who have been interested in the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for pasta
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Angelsburg in Rome: Two Japanese tourists seemed too much. The bill with 80 euros of tips was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases harm the reputation of Rome. We urge the police to investigate whether this is a fraud," said a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday issue).
The reaction of the owners of the restaurant came promptly. The Japanese women ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not clear from the bill. Also a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could actually face a dismissal proceeding after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, Democrats want to check this with their investigation in the House of Representatives now as soon as possible - it's about weeks before a decision would be made.
At the beginning of the scandal is supposedly the telephone conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy. The allegation of the whistleblower, which ultimately brought the talk to the public about national security and democracy of the U.S. with his complaint is monstrous: the president misused the power of his office to take the government of another country.
The core of this project can also be seen in the copy of the conversation with Selensky, which has been published now, although it does not give the full text, but the phone call of July 25th is only an episode of a much larger story, in the center of which, alongside Trump, is his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's point of view in May 2019, when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. It's not going to be useful to me in Kiev with the recently elected President Zelenskyi, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions can be delicate. "We don't interfere in an election, we are interfering in an investigation to what we have the right".
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies fixed on Trump’s counter-candidate in the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct an occasion for Russian investigations in the US, but this accusation was never taken seriously.
This is exactly the investigation Trump will talk so prominently to Zelenskyi on the phone in July. The version of Giuliani and the president is: the former Vice-President and currently prospective candidate for the presidential candidature of the Democrats in Ukraine, Joe Biden, has been responsible for the Ukraine representative of the Obama administration for the dismissal of the then U.
In fact, the process was a little different. When Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian Attorney General to leave, the investigation of the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also deeply accused of corrupt behaviour, the US government was by far not even the only western partner who urged Obama to dismiss it.
Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp disruptions: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, mostly Germany, the UK and Spain are affected. On the website allestören.de users report that Facebook hasn’t loaded again and again since about 3.30 pm. Instagram also reports that content couldn’t be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disruption, although not to the same extent so far.
Instagram and Co. more often affected by disturbances
This is not the first massive incident this year. Already in March and July, the services had failed for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also resort mainly to Twitter to make their anger air.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Antarctic ice by the Chilean Air Force. They were travelling on a boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the disaster - less than an hour was needed for the Chilean rescue helicopter to be rescued.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 o'clock we received the message, just before 10 we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the tubular boat."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station , 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone NIE Wireless Charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since recently several new smartphones have come to the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - first of all the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely convenient, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature sets up battery
Researchers warn of the wireless charging of smartphones. This is extremely harmful to the devices according to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick. This is due to the significantly higher heat development of the phone. If you charge a phone normally by cable, the battery also heats up to 27 degrees in addition to three hours. When charging wirelessly, the researchers even if the phone is perfectly aligned the phone.
Capacity and life
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the durability of batteries. Because each degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only reduces its capacity, but also does not last for so long. So the lifetime is lower. The researchers advise Apple to always charge the smartphone by cable. Because a battery replacement is always a cost-effective one for modern smartphones, this is likely a tip.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: Simply putting the device on a corresponding charging pad - these are now already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without annoying cable salad and tedious plug fume. However, since researchers should hardly be applied with Qi (which is for inductive energy transmission) a worldwide standard, where exceptionally there is even Apple technology.
Everest Stau Photographer: 13 Eight Thousands in Six Months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the world’s 14 highest mountains in just six months, Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal and set a record, his expedition operator said.
Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international headlines: a photo of climbers standing on Mount Everest in the spring comes from him.
The image of the mass attack sparked a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meter high mountain and the highest peak in the world. In May, eleven climbers died during the climbing in a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the ascent of the 14th eighth millennium: Currently, Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet, a reason for this is being called bad weather, among other things. Earlier this week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to enable it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals there is also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said Friday. "We suspect that the elephants have been poisoned."
The four bodies were found in a protected area near the famous rock fortress Sigiriya, visited by many tourists. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old, according to the police spokesman. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers whose land the animals had previously held harmless. At the same time, around 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This is usually happened when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
It is estimated that only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka, and their killing is theoretically the death penalty.
Detained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port town of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was detained by Iran, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards on 19 July alleged that the British-flagging tanker was in violation of law in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook's Management in Criticism
The House’s responsible economic committee intends to fully investigate the bankruptcy of the travel giant Thomas Cook. It is intended to address the board’s salary packages as well as the question of why the British government did not like to financially support the company struggling for survival. “Our interest is to oversee the company as well as the control by external accountants,” the committeee chair shared with Rachel Reeve.
Experts say genes are overestimated in bowel cancer risk
The role of genes in family increased cancer risk has apparently been overestimated so far. To this conclusion, researchers from the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are likely to be more severe than previously assumed.
Elon Musk Raises Tesla Stocks
Musk wrote this in an e-mail to Tesla employees on Thursday (local time) from the industry blog "Electrek," demand is strong so that Tesla could record 110'000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued.
The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to customers, with Tesla having to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla’s shares went out of trading with an increase of more than six percent. So strongly the price has not grown for nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins here are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Does British government want to circumvent Brexit law? Johnson retained
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covered up about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the last legislation passed by parliament against an unregulated Brexit, but on a corresponding question he just told journalists on Friday that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law requires the government to ask for a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalization law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday assumed that Johnson could try to use “political harassment” to circumvent the law, and could use a trick in proceedings that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after exit from the EU.
Johnson said he is pursuing a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is that with an agreement."
Iran Increases Uranium Enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European contracting partners in the dispute over the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, European countries show inability or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said at a press conference on Thursday at the edge of the UN General Assembly in New York.
The background is the conflict around the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return contained the pledge to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US alone dropped out of the agreement in 2018 to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to a change of course in the recently considered aggressive Middle East policy. The administration of President Donald Trump wants to make a new agreement with Uruguay.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium or at least has prepared for use. According to IAEA data, Iran is also preparing for the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of US sanctions, Rouhani alleged, but there will still be further talks that hopefully bring a solution.
Rohani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the mixture has changed: Germany, France and Britain followed on Monday the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Iranian-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen had acknowledged the attack on Wednesday.
"Those who make such accusations must provide evidence of this," Rouhani said. However, the European leaders would not have been able to do so in talks with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they would only have referred to the fact that the Johnson rebels in Yemen could not carry out such an attack. Rouhani had in recent days met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Emman of France.
Before possible talks with US President Trump, the US administration’s far-reaching sanctions would first need to be lifted, Rouhani called on the Washington government to turn to a policy of “dialogue and reason.”
Comet from another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This was done before. The comet allows conclusions about other solar systems.
What was initially just a guess is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was named after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The larger comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a home-made telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Follow-up observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be seen during a flight through our solar system.
2I/Borisov gives astronomers the rare chance to get close insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears in ever-sighted way. First observations show that the interstellar comet is clearly similar to that of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands.
According to analyses, the comet has been discovered on a so-called hyperbelic track that takes it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the first name and categorization of our heavenly bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar swing star, which was first received under the catalogue 2 of C/2019 Q
The astronomers are lucky: unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen approaching, so the researchers have many months left for research. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," Farnocchia explained.
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor. For example, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined in a first investigation the diameter of the celestial object at 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object may be similar to that of our observation comets of our solar system, and that indicates that their composition must be similar," reported IAC-Lelegein.
The IAU estimates that the discovery of just two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent these visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could potentially intercept a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa.
The agency plans to deploy the three-piece spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" (comet interceptor) at a waiting position at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth by 2028, according to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, on either an untouched fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor like 1O.
First landing at Beijing’s new mega-airport Daxing
It’s time before the 70th birthday of the People’s Republic: on the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger aircraft of China United Airlines landed, a special honor for the captain and crew.
By 2022, approximately 45 million passengers will be deployed annually at the new airport, with 72 million already in 2025. China’s President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-billion project. China’s latest prestigious project is also called “seasterns” because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four runways, which will later be extended to seven, and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to downtown Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Already during construction, the Chinese had repeatedly stated that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which was under construction since 2006 - and significantly smaller - has been postponed again and again so far. In Beijing, on the other hand, a first passenger aircraft landed after four years.
New supersonic plane to fly in 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - that is what the UK space agency is dreaming of. It is possible to make this, for the 2030s, a very special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire could have developed, the US broadcaster CNN quoted the agency as the technology.
In order to advance the project, the British space agency wants to work closer with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. In the programming of the United States, as the only aircraft for passenger transportation, the Concorde had passed the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operations in 2003. In the year 2000, there was an accident of the Concord.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transportation", writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times faster than the sound. In addition, such aircraft are also able to be used outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus allowed the "really visible generation of the Racing".
Washington riot: Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair about the US President’s potential abuse of power, Donald Trump wants to track down possible sealing spots in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the whistleblower," Trump said Thursday in front of U.S. embassy employees at the United Nations in New York, saying the person concerned was almost "a spy" and dealt with them in the past "a little differently" than today.
This was rated as an intimidation attempt against Tippgeber. The event was not actually public. However, several U.S. media released audio messages from the speech on Friday. Democrats reacted outragedly to the president’s statement.
Democrats in the House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for a lifting proceeding against Trump. Their allegations are based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence official who raised serious accusations against Trump and his government headquarters.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to have received information from several government officials that the U.S. President "uses the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in the U.S. election 2020 in his favor.
At the center of the allegations is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his counterparts to investigate that could harm his political rival Joe Biden.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of covering up the Ukrainian telephone system: Leading government officials would have endeavoured to keep the accurate text of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been prepared instead of normal, but this was removed from the White House after the conversation was directed by a lawyer.
The identity of the reporter is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was an employee of the CIA foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the source’s credibility on Friday. In a series of tweets on the topic, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called “whistleblower” had spread second-hand information that turned out to be incorrect.
However, as Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have reported to the whistleblower, it sparked outrage, but the chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted alarmedly and complained that Trump’s statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations have been underway for months in various committees against Trump and his surroundings, and in the face of Ukrainian allegations, Democrats are now moving forward with new investigations to initiate a possible impeachment proceeding against Trump.
"The whistleblower gave us a roadmap for our investigation," said the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Schiff. Trump sharply attacked Schiff, accused him of misrepresenting things and again called for the committee chairman's resignation.
More than 300 former U.S. security and foreign policy officials, who worked mostly under Democratic but also under Republican presidents, stood behind the Democratic investigation into a possible lifting proceedings on Friday.
There is no accurate timetable for the further procedure. With their majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats could endeavour to implement a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on actual dismissal was made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a process are therefore small. So far, no US president has been conducted.
VW operating council: jobs are being "sleakingly" mined
The VW brand’s plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern drives the car manufacturer’s business board. The brand intends to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion by EUR 2 billion by 2023. Of which EUR 500 million are to be saved already this year.
A key to this is the personnel costs. The "Future Pact" negotiated between companies and the Works Council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can be reduced for the car manufacturer only if it is virtually proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, an employment assurance applies by 2029.
However, as our newspaper now learned from business council circles, jobs in production that would not actually be at the disposal are "sleepingly" dismantled by a different route - that is to say past the official course.
In these cases, the Works Council has no possibility to force the re-occupation. Meanwhile, there is a lack of personnel in many places, the work compaction is increasing, the concerns about a gradual bleeding of the vehicle plants would be greater.
The brand VW wants to standardize production more globally and centrally control new projects. It also reduces costs and accelerates decisions - this is the goal of increasing productivity and thus competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "Making it firm just in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the US and China.
For the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle would decrease compared to the previous year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which will be introduced on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be shortened by 1.1 hours. Exact figures on the production duration do not mention VW, according to our newspaper, it is around Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the parent factory Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The plants Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg, VW-intern applies the thumb rule that 800,000 cars must be built there, so that the factory is satisfactorily profitable. In 2018, however, the loading in Wolfsburg was only around 700,000 vehicles.
As the manufacturing director Tostmann already announced last year, however, a million cars are expected to roll out "perspectively" in Wolfsburg, which is intended to make it possible to bundle the Golf production at the main plant - because the Zwickau plant, through the transformation to the site for the e-car production, delivers the Golf production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales of Golf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, expectations are now resting on the Golf 8. It is intended to remain for the time being the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgers despite all efforts to build the e-mobility.
Voodoo forced to prostitution: human traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria have been sworn in, thrown into the Ruhr area and forced to prostitution, and six suspected human traffickers have been jailed for this.
Six suspected human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced to probation and imprisonment sentences of up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday. The accused had sentenced young women from Nigeria to the Ruhr area and forced them to prostitute. In order to force their obedience, the Nigerian volunteers still had to go home before a voodoo priest.
The victims were between the ages of 17 and 22. They were brought over the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan smugglers in tubular boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. When they arrived in Germany, they were distributed on various bordeaux to work out the alleged smuggler costs of an average of 25,000 euros.
The accused - four men and two women - admitted the introduction and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on the brothels in the trial. "The work made women physically and mentally difficult to create," Judge Isabel Hoffmann said in the pronouncement. "Some were really disgusted."
The judgments are on commercial and band-based infringements of foreigners, human trafficking, dealing and severe forced prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm’s ongoing dispute with the Lufthansa Group has threatened the UFO flight attendant union with strikes again.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform on 14 October about the workfight measures in the LH Group," said UFO Tariff Manager Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and its daughter Eurowings have for months refused to conduct collective negotiations with the UFO.
On this point, UFO now looks strengthened after a decision of the Labour Court Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and considers to appeal against it. "I think that a second court looks at the matter completely differently, I think it is unlikely," said UFO's Board of Directors Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa also filed an application with the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to have the UFO’s status as a trade union checked in court, arguing that the union had not been employing a representative board for months and was therefore unable to perform its role as a tariff partner.
There was a heavy leadership dispute in the trade union, in which many members of the board of directors and the advisory board resigned, including the long-standing union chief Nicoley Baublies, who, due to doubts about their leadership, had suspended a previous vote on the strike of cabin personnel at Eurowings at the end of July.
Easier Entry: Saudi Arabia Announces New Visa System
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not known as an international tourist magnet, but it is now intended to change. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia aims to attract international tourists in the future. By 2030, it aims to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the tourism commission said.
“The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country,” said the chairman of the tourism commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is difficult to access for tourists so far. Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimage or visitors to the desert state. With the new rules, the arch-conservative kingdom hopes for more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riyadh wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had hit two of the largest oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country’s largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churai oil field.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos on their Instagram stories on Thursday (local time) where she was shown in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to the People magazine, had organized a boyfriend's dinner in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful suits on Instagram, including banana-printed suits, and asked his followers: “Help me to choose my wedding smoking.”
The Biebers gave their yes a year ago at a New York state office, but there had not been a larger party at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common level after initial problems: “If you don’t want to make compromises, you can’t have a relationship.”
Two dead in aircraft crash in the Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small plane in western Czech Republic. The wreckage was discovered in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Mechin) on Friday, police said. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Authorities had been searching for the aircraft since Thursday night after the crew issued an emergency signal by GPS. A military helicopter was also being searched. The cause of the accident has yet to be investigated. The crash site is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, there are diseases, alien species, non-sustainable woodfalls and the growth of cities, the IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels. It has investigated the stocks of all known 454 tree species in Europe. 265 of them are not present on any other continent. Of these 265 per cent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of risk.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" to "highly endangered", "threatened from extinction" and "extinct in nature" to "extinct" and lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species worldwide as endangered.
Ebersh and wild horse chestnut threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) is primarily threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or by the transformation or weakening of their habitats."
It also looks bad for the wild common horse chestnuts. They have been considered "endangered" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan mining moth in addition to a mushroom. It has been less widespread since the 1980s from Southeast Europe and has hardly any natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild horses in Europe.
Species of shrubs and moss are also in danger
The IUCN scientists simultaneously created new European red lists for molluscs, shrubs and moss. More than one-fifth of molluscs and moss and nearly half of all shrub species are threatened, according to the IUCN.
“This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet,” said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Office.
Earthquake in front of Istanbul: 34 injured reported
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. There were no deaths according to reports. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged, almost 200 afterquakes have occurred since the earthquake the previous day. The 5.8 earthquake on Thursday shook the marmara region outside Istanbul and triggered panic in the million-metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes over the past 20 years, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Under the Marmara Sea there is a section of the so-called North Anatolian Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian Earth Plate.
One of the most severe earthquakes was one of the 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was located at the time in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, an earthquake of a magnitude of 4.6 struck the area around Istanbul, and authorities called on residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in mid-term show
The Latin pop singer Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. That's what the singers announced on Twitter. "Size it won't," Shakira wrote about a photo of herself and Lopez. She's crazy excited to be on stage 2nd February 2020.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had been dreaming of playing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - then she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the mid-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She can't wait to "show what we girls can do on the world's biggest stage".
Shakira said in a statement that she is honored to be standing on one of the largest stages in the world alongside another artist representing Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the world. "And then on my birthday!" The event's chief sponsor wrote on Twitter that it was the first time the two "Queens" were on a stage together.
Jennifer Lopez was born in New York City and her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fight against declining spectator numbers
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and half-time show are among the most watched TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you have recently dropped spectator numbers, this February the show attracted the least spectators in the United States in more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still nearly a hundred million people on average.
In the mid-term show of the past Super Bowl, there had been riots in advance: in the quarterback quarterback dispute Colin Kaepernick in February, media reports said top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B didn’t want to appear. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the mid-term show - the reviews were unfriendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was on his knees in the season 2016/17 before NFL games at the National Anthem, He did not want to kneel against police violence and racism in 2017. With his protest, Kaepernick has triggered a self-driving movement, many players have taken over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President DonaldStar served a Trump
Cook bankruptcy: hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to be expensive about the bankruptcy of travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. High depreciations on outstanding bonds and loans are threatened. This is also affected by Credit Suisse, the Financial Times writes in its Friday issue.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse would probably have to depreciate a total of up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.8 billion in their books, according to estimates from the consulting firm AlixPartners.
Creditors of bonds would have to depreciate <0xC2><0xA3>900 million to <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion and lenders would have to depreciate <0xC2><0xA3>550 to <0xC2><0xA3>825 million, with the actual amounts to be described likely to lie at the top of the bandwidths, an expert said to the paper.
In the end, the losses of creditors will be shown at the end of the insolvency proceedings. A person close to this proceedings did not spark too much hope. For example, the approximately 40 Thomas Cook planes in the UK are "old" and many of the properties are in poor positions. The most money you can probably get out with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook.
Rackete reportedly brought alleged murderers to Italy
Sea Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are alleged to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but we ourselves do not have secure information about it," Sea Watch spokesman Ruben Neugebauer told the dpa news agency.
Other migrants had recognised the three men in Italy. They were accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The suspected perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in Messina in Italy. Neugebauer stressed that refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, crashing a ship of the Italian Financial Police. The three suspects were reported to have arrived there on that day. The captain is under investigation for aid in illegal immigration.
U.S. warns the federal government of Huawei
Ajit Pai, head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has warned the federal government not to trust the Chinese networking company Huawei.
We believe the risks are too big,” Pai told the Handelsblatt with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a “national security law” that requires every company “under Chinese jurisdiction” to follow instructions from security agencies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests,” the FCC CEO continues, making it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The federal government has now agreed to demand a "declaration of trustworthiness" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to attempt to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the Handelsblatt reports, citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just from the hardware:
It is precisely the software that is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of rows of program code that change over time," said Pai.
“It is very difficult to imagine that a government agency, no matter where, would be able to check every single update in real time to track security risks,” the FCC chief said.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership relationship is opaque. The employee company, which allegedly owns the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai told the Handelsblatt.
Pai was recently in Berlin for talks to advertise the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
At night locals hear explosions. A gigantic fire wall illuminates the sky above a Northern French chemical factory. The fire has been extinguished after hours - but the cleanup work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and nurseries in the region remain closed.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not be opened precautionarily on Friday, the competent prefecture announced. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and farmers were asked to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and cease harvest.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture said. There is still the risk that after the fire was extinguished odours will spread, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters were in use at the fire town, as well as 90 policemen and gendarmes.
A gigantic black smoke column had risen from the chemical factory before. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol factory, the oil additive manufacturer. The production facility is a few kilometers from the city center.
According to officials, the factory in Normandy belongs to the Seveso category of hazardous sites, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the news station BFMTV that there was initially no "high toxicity" in samples, but pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out.
The fire broke out early in the morning around 02.40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear initially. Rouen is a regional metropolis located on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to make greater investments to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better,” Le Maire said Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait for the economic situation to worsen in order to make the necessary decisions.”
Action should be done by those states that have budgetary margins for more investment, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these margins, the minister added, pointing to the high public debt of its country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French public debt must be "stabilized" and "decreased," Le Maire said.
In recent years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investment in order to revive the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to manage its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020, presented on Thursday, provides for tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government responds to the Yellow Vest movement’s protests, with the new debt expected to drop to 2.2 percent, according to the expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson departs question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson is sharply criticizing the parliament’s “capitulation law.”
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear Boris Johnson could still use a slip hole, but addressed this possibility, the Tory politician does not.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is covered up about whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit – despite the latest legislation passed by parliament, which is to prevent exactly that.
The law requires the government to ask for a postponement of the withdrawal date if no agreement with the EU is reached by mid-October, Johnson criticizing this as a "capitalization law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday had expressed the presumption that Johnson could try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a trick of procedure that postpones the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he is striving for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on October 31, the best way."
Johnson’s chief advisor Dominic Cummings said, meanwhile, he feels the political disputes about Brexit as a “walk in the park” and was confident that the desired exit from the EU will still be achieved: “We enjoy it, we will win, we will exit from the UK’s newspaper, don’t worry,” Cumming said.
Cummings, who led the “Vote Leave” Brexit campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now working as a chief strategy at British government headquarters Downing Street, behind the uncompromising policy that led to the Prime Minister’s situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" immerses deeply in the private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 until Linda's death in 1998, was visiblely proud and touched when he presented the band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders frontwife Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: “#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the lives of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney’s legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film.”
With Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids made it, some hundred of which are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries" for the first time.
They are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, one is still at the center: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
Then he danced with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, phoned in a bathrobe with a bag on his head, or wore unshaped moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they had been cleaning up the old ones on their farm in southern England or in Scotland.
Like hardly any other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the instant moment. Linda McCartney’s shots are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than mere snapshots.
It's about choosing click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to knip it at the exact right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you knip it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it could be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing the exact right moment. "She just knew she did it," Paul said in the Eshun Essay.
The light, composition, frame cut and colours are true, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to anecdotals, it is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also appeared as abstract paintings.
“We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published Friday that Turkey could not stop importing oil and gas from Iran, despite US sanctions imposed on Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there,” Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan has admitted that Turkey is having problems importing Iranian oil as some companies have withdrawn "because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran especially on this issue and on many other issues," said the Turkish president, who had repeatedly criticized U.S. sanctions against Iran in the past.
The U.S. has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since its exit from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, according to the U.S. secretly pursuing a nuclear program and failing to comply with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to a collapse in Iran’s oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and tensions in the Gulf region have increased considerably in recent months.
U.S. government wants to restrict reception of refugees
The U.S. government wants to drastically restrict the reception of refugees. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling of a resettlement program should be lowered from currently 30,000 to 18,000 refugees.
The Department of Foreign Affairs said that while the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, the main task is to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overburdened.
In the future, the U.S. government wants to focus on receiving two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith – and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus endangered, as the Foreign Ministry’s statement shows, with a maximum of 1,500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The programme, launched in 1980, selected refugees from UN camps around the world and relocated to the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the program’s history. Even the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low. When the predecessor of U.S. President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House at 8,000
“This is a very sad day for America,” said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. “The United States would continue to harm its leadership role in protecting the world’s most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the U.S. – legally and illegally. The U.S. government expects 350,000 asylum applications for the coming budget year. These figures are separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump: "Come close to a spice"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers in the whistleblower affair of espionage. Whoever has given the whistleblower who accuses him of abuse of power corresponding clues "comes close to a spice," Trump said, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday.
According to Trump, when asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This comes close to a spice." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did in old times when we were clever? Right. The spies and betrayal, we're doing a little bit of it."
The Democrats criticized Trump’s remarks and accused him of intimidation from witnesses, as well as an attempt to hinder a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment proceeding against him, wrote the chairs of the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Foreign Affairs.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a complaint now published for misusing his office to ask for another country's interference in the U.S. election 2020. Specifically, it is about his disputed Ukrainian phone call with his Ukrainian co-worker Volodymyr Selenskyy in summer: In the talks, Trump suggested him to investigate H. Biford's possible.
It is still unclear who both the whistleblower himself and his informants are, but as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is said to be an analyst from the foreign intelligence CIA.
Refugee boat crowned: baby and toddlers drown in the Aegean Sea
People are trying to get from Turkey to Greece over the Aegean Sea again and again, often with too small boats. Seven migrants, including five children, have now died in the decline of a boat.
Seven migrants were killed outside the Greek island of Chios in the collapse of a boat, including one baby and four other children, the Greek coast guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were rescued from the floods by the crew of a passed ferry.
Among the victims is also a smuggler, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had departed from Turkey in the morning, trying to reach the small island group Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
It is unknown from which countries the migrants come. Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean, mostly in too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), 174 people were killed on this route.
The Who Cancel Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who has come to a sharp end because of the impasse of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the appearance on Wednesday night (local time) in Houston his voice failed to serve. For the eighth song Daltrey told the audience, "I think I should leave it as long as it's still running."
Leading guitarist Pete Townsend apologized, adding that Daltrey could "not really speak now". Townsend promised the audience to come at his expense at a compensation concert, but an appointment is not yet fixed.
The Who said they would be picked up later on Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly stopped: WeWork makes real estate markets tremble
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork is rising from a small startup to a driving force on the world’s most expensive real estate markets. But now the company is in a crisis.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had just days ago deposed founder Adam Neumann as chief of the market, postponed the planned market start and started selling the biggest office of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the executives. WeWork immediately to gain financial margin for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork rents new office spaces in the long term and rents them to members in partly small units. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or entire departments of large corporations. So far, WeWork is burning up the new money with this business at a stunning speed. Last year, the company alone incurred a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with maturities of up to 15 years, resulting in commitments of more than $40 billion, which could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, "WeWork in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, was best rented in AlWork in Manhatten in the past 24 months. WeWork's office alone new contracts made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than that at the time WeWork would have newly arrived in.
Even in the UK capital, the balance could shift noticeably in the real estate market without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a office house in the center of the financial metropolis, which was bought last year by the Sparkassen fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros.
Many landlords have converted their properties to the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, real estate owners would probably have to deduct a portion of the expected billions of revenues. Access to the parent - reserves of WeWork in each case they have not established such limited reserves despite the long-term rental agreements.
Russia arrested several North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has once again taken action against North Korean fishermen and a total of 262 others have been arrested in recent days who have illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB told the agency Interfax on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Earlier, border guards had been shot and three of them injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
Accordingly, the North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian territorial waters. There the Russian Coast Guard is patroling to protect its marine biological resources according to its own data. In the re-controls, 30,000 inkfish were found in total. More than three fishermen and two motor boats were seized in 2018, and more than two agency boats were seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet at Ridiwok.
The Russian Fisheries Authority did not issue any fishing licences to North Koreans after complaining by local entrepreneurs, and thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been temporarily arrested there in 2019, according to the media.
The head of the Association of Russian fishing companies in the Far Eastern Primorje region, Georgi Martynov, also recently complained of high ecological damage from the North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. With these, small animals would also be removed from the sea. Furthermore, the nets would simply dispose of the sea, where they would consume the 200 years.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the arrests last week. One injured North Korean was later killed, according to the FSB. On 17 September, Russian border guards first arrested a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened fire.
US bans entry to former President Castro
The U.S. has imposed entry bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Foreign Ministry justified this in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "growth human rights violations". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he is facing a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily arrested and more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the Armed Forces, the brother of the deceased revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also guilty of human rights violations there by the support of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard for human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and in Venezuela," Twitter said.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued entry bans, among others, against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce power struggle between the government and the opposition has been arising for months. The United States has imposed a whole series of sanctions against Maduro’s government to force him on his knees and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim President Juan Guaido to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro’s closest allies. The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of deployed doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New Climate Protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to go to the streets again for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning actions and rallyings in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia are likely to start because of the time shift before protests move across Europe to North America. There climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a large rally in Montreal, Canada. Also in front of the White House in Washington.
Thunberg himself was good. "Last Friday over four million people striked for the climate. This Friday we are doing it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
In particular in Germany, the inflow was very large last Friday. A good third of all worldwide demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had been involved in the protests according to Fridays for Future estimates in 575 German cities. This time, according to a list of the movement, people are planned to go to demonstrations in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Colognec, but also in smaller municipalities such as Wün and J.
At the age of 15, Thunberg sat before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on Sweden’s politicians to increase their commitment to climate protection. The Fridays-for-Future movement has emerged within a short time. The climate protests are mainly involved by students and students, but increasingly by scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming must be curtailed to below 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg had arrived in New York nearly a month ago after a two-week transatlantic turmoil. She had recently participated in live climate protests and United Nations summits. On Monday she gave a Right emotional speech, in which she spoke to the world’s leaders. Her homeland, Stockholm, was more conscientious about her dedication to climate protection.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," a spokesman for the emergency ministry said Thursday in Moscow to the agency Tass. The ban is expected to take effect on 1 October.
Those who smoke, however, will have to expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette ignites a fire, the penalty is higher. Under the prohibition, candles are likewise burning, according to the ministry. Even meat spits are no longer allowed to grill on the balcony.
Hit against cybercriminals - Investigators raise servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time uncovered a large server provider for illegal businesses on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected as the operator of a data center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Moselle have hosted numerous websites through which international criminals operate their operations.
This was announced by the Attorney General’s Office in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested in a major action on Thursday night. The Darknet is a shielded part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are reported to have been among others the operators of the world's second largest darknet drug marketplace, "Wall Street Market", which investigators had crushed in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyberbunker, according to the Attorney General.
Such a host was first excavated in Germany, it said. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action with the support of special forces such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and neighbouring abroad. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. At noon, investigators want to inform about more details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people want to go to the streets again for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallyings in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate Protests <0xC7><0x80> Who are actually Thunberg’s backmen?
Sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. The more surprising it is that precisely a 16-year-old girl keeps the mirror in front of the powermen of this time. But what is behind it? Is it willingness or clever marketing of a climate activist or historical mastership?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in motion and brings young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man can get on the sea with Greta to win a cluster of children and youth. As early as 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt like to get on the seaway over this world.
But is there a shadow side in this regard? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has not come to the rich PR managers in her side. By the way, her mother has published a book, which has also sold itself far, thanks to the daughter standing in the spotlight. Also the old-proven followers of Greta Thunberg were a little trouble with the world.
Here the spirits are now divorced: is it morally correct to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people during the World Rescue Action work together with stock marketers? No matter what position certain trends may ultimately be held in this regard, a critical and reflected point of view is ever more important in a democratically shaped society, because the opinions of
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crosses Our Solar System
An alien comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The assumptions of the astronomers have been confirmed: an alien comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, the researchers only suspected it, but now they have certainty: a comet from another star is currently crossing our solar system. It was named after its discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently employing astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissov in Crimea. He looked up to the sky with a home-made telescope and further follow-up observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet not from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be seen during the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to capture close insights into an alien solar system. Apparently, the Comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. The comet is clearly of interstellar origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbelic track that drives it out of our system.
Comet was spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it in depth. Because unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in its approach, which means that it can be examined from Earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness of the professional authority and then only be seen by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," explains NaRaumcchia of the US.
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First insights about comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometers in diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the weaving star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de Levieros.
The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Recently, a giant asteroid rushed past the Earth and came dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely rejectable": Rachel Johnson horrified by brother
Boris Johnson is becoming more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister whips in clear words the prime minister's warrior language as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Fake", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is continuing to arm - at least verbally. At the questioning hour in the lower house this Wednesday, it encountered massive outrage of the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have reported to the word: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother uses words like surrender as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, lengthened, divided, tarnished and suspended". She thinks that is extremely rejectable to the UK. She does not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who was anti-Parliament in the EU elections.
In particular, she came across that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, a EU-friendly lower house member, who had been "best killed by a neo-nazi" in 2016, the first of which was called "the most obvious" by Johnson's "sister's memories can be honoured by passing through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the lower house. "It's very tasteless to refer to a member.
Cox's widow also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick if Jo's name is used in this way," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to enter passionately and determined for whatever one believes - whatever one's view. But you should never be likely to "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere was created.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had deposed his position as Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory Member. "I have been torn in recent months between loyalty to family and national interest - it is an indissoluble tension," Jo Johnson justified the move.
Johnson’s language also encountered sharp criticism in the church. As the Times reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that “is not worthy of this country”. In a joint statement, they declared: “In recent days, the language has been not acceptable with respect, both in debates and outside of parliament.”
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez play at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL puts a strong sign: in the mid-term show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear, promising "an explosion of fun and energy".
Super Bowl Latina power: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the mid-time show in the upcoming U.S. Football League NFL final, the organizers announced Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, celebrating its 100th birthday next year, will take place on February 2 in Miami. In the metropolis on the south tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and will be seen in German cinemas in the drama "Hustlers" from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer, making her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the mid-term guests is expected every time in the United States. Many this year also regard the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the biggest U.S. sports event and a huge advertising show. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones have raised the fury there. The NFL final is usually watched by more than 100 million television viewers, and is now extremely popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy in advance. The reason was the quarterback quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to stand up against blacks in protest against police violence. Pink anthem was played, and for this many had been attacked harshly by US President Donald Trump. In solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had a super-B
An actor and youtuber is targeting Egypt’s ruler: for the time being, Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have influence on whether Egypt's streets are flowing blood again, both of them have spent abroad. The President's one of the two had moved back to the airport of Cairo. The President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former general, who spent the Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of the country in 2013, had departed in Iraq.
Going astray - this is what the president of the other man, who currently determines what happens on the streets, believes. Mohamed Ali remained naturally abroad, where he avoids the access of the security forces, who would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter the Egyptian soil. Weeks ago, the 45-year-old was known as an actor only to a minority of the Egyptian.
He addresses the head of state directly and in a quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president enjoys luxury and are allowed to build magnificent new palaces, it is said there. The army leadership on which Sisi relies his rule, Ali explodes straight corruption and enrichment. Because in his second career as a contractor, for 15 years, he seems to know exactly where these gentlemen are talking.
For the first time since Sisi's grip after power, thousands had demonstrated against his rule and nearly 2,000 citizens, among them prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested independently. For example, the videos were called for a "million-dollar march" for this Friday. That really so many people would dare to the streets was unlikely.
From the town of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where the protesters were destroyed, banners with the portrait of the president in pieces, a massive police presence was reported here on Friday.Security forces were to destroy other checkpoints in the city and the Muslim streets.In Cairo, several subway stations in downtown 2011, due to "maintenance works", most roads around the Tahrir Square were closed.
Mohamed Ali prompted these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our target does not have to be the Tahrir Square," Ali said in his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers." But as a withdrawal, this is not to be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrir Square."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the internet connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different checking options.
If you enter into an internet contract, you don’t need to blindly trust the provider’s speed data. Customers can check themselves how much of it is actually achieved in the event of any inconveniences.
Finally, the pre-promised transmission rates are a contractual component and should therefore also be achieved, the Consumer Central Bavaria explains.
If the connection seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different checking options. For example, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed on in the contract.
“The suppliers’ tests are, however, based on specific supplier specifications and are therefore not consistently and objectively calculated,” says the Consumer Center for Bavaria on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance.
If this does not result even after several requests, customers can cancel and may also ask for damages, but if it does not succeed, only the lawsuit will help.
First high-ranking Republican for investigation
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that goes from here can be determined by the facts that will be determined," Phil Scott said at a press conference Thursday. He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair.
Scott said he was not surprised by disclosures that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy in a phone call to investigate interventions by Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have shown discomfort for this. Scott’s remarks are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has repeatedly opposed Trump’s policy, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man remains in MCU: Another Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel will go separate paths in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how to continue with the films about Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man will receive another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home".
Kevin Feige is quoted in the magazine "Screenrant" by Marvel Boos: "I am delighted that Spidey's path will continue in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Studios are delighted that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony will never continue to work on his Spidey verse."
But what happens to the sudden good news? Sony Marvel reportedly submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which also includes Marvel, would share in the revenue of coming Spider-Man movies with 30 percent, but the news is not confirmed.
Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry in the "Suits" Final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now reached the major final in the USA. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and just as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years, were charmingly dumped. Note, the following sections contain spoil series
One thing in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some glances again showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duchess, such as the moments of the failed and successful wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his sentence.
But even her real husband, Prince Harry, was occasionally mentioned in the "Suits" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is just walking toward the altar to get married by his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a much-minded comment.
Aegean Sea: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children were drowned in the wake of a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea and seven people were killed in the crash, the Greek coast guard said on Friday.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men were rescued.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey are transferring to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean. Last year, according to UNHCR, 174 people were killed on this route. Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that he will visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the responsible EU Commissioner, he wants to "inform in Turkey about the situation of refugees," said Seehofer on Friday, and then wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help with the dealing.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission on Friday confirmed Seehofer’s planned trip with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, the Greek Ministry of Citizens’ Protection said on Wednesday.
Does the Turkish deal still work?
The rising numbers recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement concluded in 2016. This provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who come illegally through Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to welcome a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each deported Syrian.
However, asylum applications are being processed on the Greek side because of a lack of personnel. On Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Citizens’ Protection, there are almost 29,400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5,200 migrants are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee pact in March 2016, there have never been so many, state broadcaster reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to medical professionals, climate change will put the health system to the test in the future. Climate changes are "completely certain" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology.
Green politician must take responsibility for embarrassing photo shots
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green Leader holds a reusable cup in his hand on a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has gone unnoticed for quite a long time - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw has never been reported by Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she was seen on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and a bean was also spread to the media.
Green Chief must take responsibility for photo pane
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party produced fake news in order to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection" in the middle of an election campaign to the lower house election, in which Trudeau also became increasingly difficult because of a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and started the discussion about fake news. One user shares a comparison of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairs to hide their disposable cup."
May showed herself shocked and warned on her blog that she didn’t know anything about this action. To emphasize this, she immediately posted the original: she, talking to citizens, had a cup in her hand. However, she put her website right, it was from bamboo. She was always there. A spokeswoman of the party said it was just about having the party logo in the picture.
May writes, “I don’t want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide,” she tells the Guardian, and at the same time asks something from her over-engaged team: “If they want to edit a picture again, couldn’t they do something to my face so I look younger?”
The German Greens have also fallen into Shitstorms because of their use of disposable plastic or because of air travel - but their pictures were not photographed. For example, the chief of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate ice cream with plastic spoons on vacation, as Mercury reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: lifelong flight ban on Cathay
Jaqueline Ng claimed to have been upgraded by Cathay Pacific by mail, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she was never allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontaneous upgrades to the Business Class - many passengers dream of it, sometimes they are lucky, and the staff at check-in offer a free change from the Economy Class.
However, this case shows how not to do it: a self-declared influencer actively asked Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users on Instagram. On May 30 she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the departure flight, the Jaqueline employees refused an upgrade, despite showing an email allegedly envisaging an upgrade to Cathay Pacific. The letter said the influencer received it from an airline’s marketing employee, while the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman is supposed to have shown the same mail, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK Airport were skeptical: they followed the headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail allegedly comes from is not supposed to have denied the mail contact with Jaqueline.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifetime ban on flight with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about 1,280 euros), she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company that represents consumer interests, because although Cathay had reimbursed her the price of her original ticket, Jaqueline also claimed the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the mail's metadata, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, remains blocked for future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to satisfy itself with it - and now hire a lawyer.
Oil prices fall after report on ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest possible time on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea Brent variety cost $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) variety fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The Wall Street Journal reported a cease-fire in Yemen that Saudi Arabia had agreed to a cease-fire in four areas.
A drone attack on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had ceased five percent of the world’s oil production in mid-September. The allied Huthi rebels in the civil war country of Yemen had complained of the attacks. Saudi Arabia blames Iran, like the US government. A ceasefire would cause political tension in the region en.
If an agreement is actually reached, we can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of the raw materials strategy department at Saxo Bank at Bloomberg news agency.
A barrel of WTI oil cost nearly $59, Brent nearly $65 a week ago.
Bloomberg recently reported that oil repair work in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September is progressing faster than expected, according to which the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back to the original amount.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders reporting on the rapid progress of the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair works, but raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning a market launch and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation was suggested in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on the way to leave the port more than two months after Iran's arrest and the recent release granted. The crew is now preparing departure while the ship continues to lie in front of an anchor, a shipping company chief Erik Hånell said in a statement.
However, the U.S. announced that it would move defense missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia as an Iranian enemy. Fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and Britain had significantly increased oil prices in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump are intensifying
In the affair of possible abuse of power by U.S. President Donald Trump's accusations of cover-up against the White House have been voiced. "Several leading government officials would have intensely endeavoured to prevent" after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyy.
North Korea calls Trump and Kim’s third summit questionable
North Korea has raised doubts that it will soon come to a third summit between President Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump in the nuclear dispute, and the meaning and prospects of success of such a meeting are questionable because of lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, chief diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said Friday, according to agency KCNA.
The U.S. has so far done nothing to implement the Summit decisions last year, the North Korean Foreign Ministry adviser said, criticizing tightened U.S. sanctions and US-South Korean joint military manoeuvres, but hopes Trump’s “wise” and “courageous” decision to get closer again.
Trump said on Monday he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim should bring before he declares himself. Negotiations on disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and rocket program have been stunned since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, the two met in the unmilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
Prince Harry: Weapon manufacturers are expected to help with mine clearance
Clothing in a blue splitter protective vest, British Prince Harry symbolically set off and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he made the aid of the ignition circle. In a safe distance, the explosives exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later called for all of the land television cameras.
Pounds under pressure - interest rate reduction expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of a rapid rate reduction, the pound loses its value against the euro.
The Bank of England (BoE)’s speculation about a soon rate cut is on the Sterling Pound, with the UK currency declining by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who initiated a reduction in interest rates, even if a chaotic Brexit could be avoided, as uncertainty would affect the British economy in the foreseeable future. This statement is surprising from Evangelides, as Saunders claimed to be the advocate of a restrictive monetary policy, Activdohaus said Analy.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy due to the Brexit hickhack, without directly signaling a reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country from the EU even if necessary without a divorce agreement on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay off for him, says Handelsblatt editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: More Russian Manipulations Proven
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and today's chief of integrity of the World Athletics Association.
At the start of the World Athletics Championship, new details about the doping scandal in Russia are revealed - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and even initially recovered.In January 2019, the Moscow doping laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agen Tour.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed. After this, the Wada had suspended the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee allowed Russia to compete in the winter sports in 2018. After individual examinations at the summer games in Rio 2016, around 270 athletes of the country.
Positive findings are missing
In the following September, the Wada picked up the Rusada Bann, but demanded access to the lab and the samples. The data should provide information on the extent of cover-up of doping cases in state doping. They should help subsequently punish athletes. Three months later they were finally delivered.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the World Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory was manipulated by McLafan. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the correct data," said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Athletics Association is the only organization that holds on to the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
Earlier this week, the Wada manipulations had already put into space and called on Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the re-blocking of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
