Quickly Progressive Cumulative Incidence of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, January 1 to March 15, 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease cases (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and ICUs should be more prepared for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and mainly intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, a portion of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causing agent as being a new coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection is called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves to a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% evolve to a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and in the UK and compared them with those in the Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy between January 31 and March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 has spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on January 24, 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of March 15, 2020, COVID-19 cases had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between December 31, 2019 and the date mentioned above, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, is updated every day at 8am.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them to those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculate the cumulative truncated 14-day incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported from each country by March 15, 2020 at 8 a.m., and compared with Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed those of Hubei Province in China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the UK, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around February 21 and increased significantly, then around February 28, 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed similar increased trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to that in Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that by March 15 at 8 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks or less ago.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs despite countries being at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different country case definitions and different protocols for the selection of patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for update.
Earlier in March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive treatment units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 hospital hospitalization and/or ICU hospitalization are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data with a focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal per 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and semi-intensive treatment beds for a population of 100,000 inhabitants between 2010 and 2011).
Modeled scenarios related to health system capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a greater risk of 90% of intensive-treatment bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC’s rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since the cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive treatment units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should preferably be made available in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who will need medical assistance, mainly intensive treatment, such as in affected regions of Italy.
As emphasized in the ECDC’s rapid risk assessment, a quick, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from the containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not give enough time to decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions adequately, if not implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to intensify their control initiatives to decrease the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 disease (SARS-CoV-2) of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its counterpart virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people, and men more than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the rapidly developing research object.
We will deal with the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
While many questions still require answers, we hope this study will help in understanding and eradicating this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been forced to stay confined throughout the holiday and for several subsequent weeks due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus has great resemblance to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the respective disease was named CoV-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovered and more than 3,000 patients dead.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “public enemy number one” and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequencing of the single virus of several patients.
This article aims to summarize the progress of research in this new rapidly developing area.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, a 2012 epidemic).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, causing mostly about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice found highly pathogenic human CoVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causes of an epidemic originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which soon spread to several other countries with scary morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third COV epidemic in the documented history of human beings.
As shown in Fig.1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the CoV sequencing was published.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, the contagion of healthcare professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transportation interrupted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the starting point of the contagion by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread to China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig.
As the situation is rapidly aggravating, the scale and final severity of the epidemic are still to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a study of several centres with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed patients with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the age group of 30 to 65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50, some were under 20, and only 14 infected were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in groups, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean death time based on symptom appearance was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of people infected grew exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the massive transportation time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genres, namely: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect humans.
The envelope glycoprotein spike (S) binds to its cellular receptors of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and, as a consequence, membrane fusion occurs.
The genome of viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins form vesicles that contain virions, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequential samples collected from the same original outbreak site, the Huanan Sea Fruit Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the electronic transmission microscope, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in ultrafine sections of the epithelium of the human airways.
Human ECA2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to human ECA2 protein weaker than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the full-length cryo-EM structure of human ECA2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans through cyvets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like bat CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host who helped the virus cross species barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the bat virus to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that pangolins, elongated mouth mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the genetic homology of 99% between a pangolins-discovered CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a major difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete evidence are being expected (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown yet.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and for up to 5 days below 20°C with humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorexidine, are efficient in deactivating the virus.
Overall, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help in the defense of cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing apoptosis of T cells.
Humoral immunity, including supplements such as antibodies C3a and C5a, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, at worst, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance of symptoms in a group of people, more affects the elderly with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and mostly 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to other people.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to be in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, corizo, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in lung imaging, should be screened for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilatory support, much more than COVID-19 patients, which is the highest mortality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In patients with SARS, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilation support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, when confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Comparatively, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study of June 2012, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the baseline R0 reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV ranged from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, it is a much bigger challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than that of MERS-CoV and that of SARS-CoV.
The appearance of symptoms in a group of people usually occurs in the same family or in the same cluster or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms, and healed patients who have been discharged from hospitals may contract the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong the quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte counts below 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Enzyme and myoglobin levels in muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was high, and the lymphocyte count showed progressive reduction.
Chest X-ray abnormalities are present in most COVID-19 patients, and have irregular bilateral shadows or opacity in matte glass in the lungs.
Patients usually developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely compromise gas exchange.
Dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most serious chest x-ray results usually correspond to the most serious form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the peeling of pneumotics, the formation of the hyaline membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and syncytic cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathology of the viral infection and RASD, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through polymerase-reverse transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which went on to be derived not only from RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to reach an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 x 10-18 mol/L at 200 x 10-18 mol/L need (10 to 100 copies per microliter input) using a complex rod at less than one hour.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors can provide, at the best of their capacity, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of therapies that have been used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, cured patients’ plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with expression of ECA2, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high-flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified alternative cardiopulmonary technique used for the treatment of severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine cascade is known to result from exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response, characterized by the release of a number of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumabe, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of targeted immune response to T cells; blocking of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab; suppressing cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the prognosis.
However, short periods of treatment with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses were recommended for cautionary use in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially aimed at treating diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other single-band RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct some tests on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being long awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and generation of antibodies
The blood collection of patients who have cured themselves of a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from the contraction of the disease has a long history.
In fact, healed patients usually have a relatively high level of blood antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who healed from COVID-19, and was injected in 10 patients in severe state.
Its symptoms improved in 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma is great to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight an epidemic of global proportion.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or do a screening for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
In this way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend greatly on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on theories of TCM.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, MTC has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it has been found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in treating COVID-19.
The best healing rates for COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, obtained the lowest healing rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, as many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between unique treatment with Western medicine and combined treatment of Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time required for recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization was considerably shorter in the group treated by Western medicine and TCM than only in the group treated by Western medicine.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated with Western medicine and TCM than for the group treated with Western medicine alone (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated with Western medicine and TCM than in the group treated with Western medicine alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MTC still await more properly controlled tests on larger scales and at more centers.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of CTM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel great fear of the highly contagious and fatal disease, and people in quarantine also feel bored, lonely and irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the early stage of the SARS epidemic, various psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, symptoms of psychosis, delusion and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
Mandatory contact tracking and quarantine, as part of the public health system’s actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they can feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and the stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of the disease and people who have had contact with them, as well as the general population that needs it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives have been taken to develop protein S-based vaccines to generate potent and lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and models of lethal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before a clinical trial begins.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS has disappeared 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and MERS foci continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a prognosis model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with a shortage of resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people between the ages of 30 and 65, with 47.7% of patients over the age of 50, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to experience underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the outcome in health of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: Covid-19 patients in need of intensive treatment are more likely to suffer acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Heart episodes were the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to positive ECA2 cholangiocytes, which can lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have strong correlations and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and was proposed as a potential prognostic factor for the disease, response to therapy, and final recovery.
The correlation of CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also assist in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are expressively present in several organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: Chest x-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues for the prediction of outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Steroid Use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dosage of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in a low dosage and for a short period of time in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and witness the deaths of loved family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counselling and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the early stage of infection (or causes only mild symptoms), similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or in the incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are severely ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the early stage.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Great efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and surrounding cities, and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population, hoping to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have dramatically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends until March, and the slowdown phase lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., has established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the scrubs of the throat and average hornet of patients who recovered and were discharged from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the new virus identified could become a flu-like cyclic episode.
Meanwhile, promising evidence occurred in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with rigid quarantine and isolation, the disease was ultimately kept under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, may become weaker in its infectiousness and at some point become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and that of MERS can be found below (Fig. (Fig. 55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by coughing and sneezing and possibly by direct contact with virus-contaminated materials.
The virus has also been found in feces, which generates a new possibility: that of oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 healthcare professionals.
Therefore, greater precaution should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare professionals, social workers, family members, coworkers and people with direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to decrease the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid droplets of a potentially infected individual from being transported into the air or sticking to the surfaces of objects, where they can infect other people.
However, only the N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against inhalation of virions with a size of 10 nm at 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions being able to fully penetrate it; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to the SARS-CoV, and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients should wear the N95 masks (series No. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to the masks, healthcare professionals should wear insulation bathrobes to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when taking care of patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay at home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to decrease the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have caused a major warning to China, based on its recent history with the 2003 SARS epidemic.
However, only on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of contagion and limited reproductivity among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
China’s disease control agencies can take advantage of this tough lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by the public and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to uncommon information from hospitals, rather than expect formal reports from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its early stage, and be more sensitive to the public's.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic generated a feeling of SARS return.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the containment of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and men more than women, and severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they have no symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are severely ill, which causes a greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in parts, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA trial for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, healed patients may receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several critical issues still need to be solved as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic counterpart has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat CoVs, we can still not conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the original host virus, the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we will not be able to cut the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic may have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter respiratory cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells with ECA2 expression in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS, or will it have seasonal recurrence, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of what efforts are needed, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human CoVs (HCoVs) caused a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed what was thought about CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 placed CoVS in the spotlight again and surprised everyone with their high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to their brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is enormously useful.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of diseases in humans.
Investigation of host VOC interactions in animals can also provide important information on VOC pathogenesis in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the existing information on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
An important analysis is that we do comparison and contrast between different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Furthermore, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, which comprises a group of encapsulated, positive polarity viruses and simple ribbon RNA.
These viruses that have the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed in an electronic microscope.
As for the structure, CoVs have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contain two overlapping open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, referred to as nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific lineage accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genres (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the chirish of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, with both causing self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating today and infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the epidemic of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which took more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people by March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origins in bats, mice or pets.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts, with important implications in the future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlighted and discussed the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are generally not pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but they become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the trend of evolution of HCoV, in which increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCoV-229E B814 strain from the chill of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mice, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E experienced symptoms of common cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in mice brains during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection seem similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
Overall, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, accompanied by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across various countries and continents.
With the exception of "superspreaders", it was estimated that each contaminated person can contaminate approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak of viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, illness and chills, followed by later symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lymphopenia, liver dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are the common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients at some point need intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be affected in these serious cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be lethal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been dedicated to research on HCoV.
The HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found that the virus was prevalent in young children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of corizo, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby who suffered from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered all over the world.
It was estimated that HCoV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crupe.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
All of these four community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to suffer mutation and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause serious lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Overall, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be efficiently transmitted and to continuously maintain in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and in Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also develop acute kidney failure, which is therefore quite peculiar to MERS, among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
By February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases per laboratory were reported with a high confirmed case-related mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
Half by the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was known to be retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 an internationally important public health emergency and also named the COVID-19 disease.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that the mortality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the mortality outside of that city is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but is more communicable compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus around the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and duration of the progression of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six HCoVs.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lies between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCoVs acquired in the community (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presence of non-specific, mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns, both in community-acquired HCoVs and in SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies whether the oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can exhibit seasonality, such as in cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its communicability, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its passing to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, the two could be the survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop serious diseases of HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the time the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance of the virus adapting to humans.
If adaptation is adequate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, the four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses do not need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to human beings, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as HCoVs acquired in the community, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate between us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it houses a direct relationship ancestor, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts the HCoV in a continuous and lasting manner.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
On the other hand, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adequately adapt to the new host, and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmit it to humans and increase the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have the infection interrupted if it fails to sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent investigations of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of antiSARS-CoV IgG, compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that wild masked palm civets or farms without exposure to living animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could be only the intermediate host amplifier, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of different animals in the markets in Guangzhou have antiSARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals can serve as intermediate hosts amplifier SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All these animals seem to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search for the natural SARS-CoV animal host revealed a narrow-linked bat CoV, named SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese bat-ferrous.
These bats are positive for antiSARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV, except for the so-called WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ECA2) in humans is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It has been shown that WIV1 derived from fecal samples of bats uses ECA2 from bats, cyvets, and humans as a receptor for entry into cells.
It is intriguing that the serum of SARS convalescent patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the ancestor with the closest relationship to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 of bats and CoV-HKU5 of bats.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same receptor as the host, dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
MERS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences are phylogenetically closer to the beta-CoV counterparts of identified bats in Europe and Africa.
So far, no living MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle East studies have shown that dromedals are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific neutralization antibodies, just like Middle Eastern camels in several African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from dromedary nasal rubs, increasing evidence that camels serve as the legitimate host of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that symptoms usually mild but with massive transmission of the virus have been observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is remarkable that infected camels transmit the viruses not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main virus transmission route in bats.
However, there are still no answers, since many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which can be attributed, plausiblely, to transmission between people or to transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that house MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13, isolated from bats Rhinolophus affinis.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the immediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat CoVs are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 intermediate animal hosts should be set up among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huanan Sea Fruit Wholesale Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 have been associated, indicating a likely event of transmission from animals to humans.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also house ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to RaTG13, with about 90% identity at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into SARS-CoV-2-like virus substrates in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in the amino acid sequence.
In an enormous contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although they have a high degree of sequential homology across the genome.
A recent study on sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral consensus sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of configuration and manual curation to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolim is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently there is no evidence to confirm the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 of pangolins due to sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of pangolins.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 of pangolins.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolim, beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the higher broad genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of beta-CoVs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
A contrary argument is in favour of the recombination between betaCoV of SARS-CoV-2-related pangolins and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have originated from bat CoVs, while parental HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in the American tricolor bat had a direct relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also a suspicion that the camelides are their intermediate hosts.
For greater clarity, current knowledge about known animal origins of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of the HCoV-229E is less clear.
AlfaCoVs of bats closely related to HCoV-229E were discovered.
Among them, there is an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of the bat virus to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, alphaCoVs of bats related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alphaCoV of alpacas caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphaCoV of alpacas was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain from humans the HCoV-229E-related alphaCoV.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as a genetic pool for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedals can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedals and from dromedals to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in its initial identification and was corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, colonies with high density, narrow social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral spreader".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV into the dromedary dates back decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, and has migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV, since its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
Specifically, betaCoVs of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a terminal host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similarly to civets, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Various possibilities for the interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats through slaughter or coal mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of the intermediate hosts amplifiers, in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been newly introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is required.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating CoVs crossing species barriers.
First, its relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-band RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of the CoV to the new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessively high mutability and attenuation, or even inviability.
It is interesting that the nucleotide analog remdesivir suppresses the replication of CoV through inhibition of this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising antiSARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of CoVs are almost one million times higher than those of their hosts.
Furthermore, the mutation rate is usually high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who maintains contact with human beings.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedals.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large genome of RNA in CoVs exerts extra plasticity in the genome modification for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions relative to the last three inches of the genome end.
Third, CoVs exchange the models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a single "copy choice" mechanism.
In a host serving as a mixing container, tape exchange occurs frequently during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs, such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between human and cyvet SARS-CoV isolates, it is believed that SARS-CoV goes through a rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with DLR mutations in protein S.
Overall, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in 318° to 510° amino acids in S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its correceptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is capable of recognizing the ECA2 receptors of various animals, including bats, cyvets, mice and raccoon dogs, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid residues were different from the human and cyvet viral isolates in DLR, and four of them are located at the receptor binding reason for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV of the cyvets has K479N and S487T mutations in their DLR, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be critical to viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of its protein S to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopy indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times greater than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other corrector may be needed for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
It is intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of protein S.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylate for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs in humans after the interspecies transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence on the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and HCoV natural reservoir hosts such as bats, dromedals and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for effective cross-species transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-tendentious screening with a genomic range of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
New HCoVs: Back to the Zero Stake
The diversity of bat CoVs provides broad possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein coding genes has the potential to dramatically modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but it has been found that they encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide exclusion feature 29 of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs lineages, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, mostly in nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic has undergone recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaria in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in the viral genomes, likely resulting from relieving selection pressure exerted on the viruses, such as the host’s immune system pressure.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alphaCoV of alpacas has a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in frames.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats are likely to be well adapted to anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in activating the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminator cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the NKG2/CD94 natural exterminator cell inhibitor receptor, and the low degree of expression of class I molecules from the main histocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen species (EROs) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats can both suppress CoV replication and affect exorribonuclease review, thus providing the selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of proteins or new protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause at most mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without causing a high immune response from the host.
This document provides explanations of the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, where the higher the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was shut off from CoV replication.
The same immune response shutdown strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is specifically strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of interferon type I at the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of inflammasome NLRP3 in bats is deficient.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of inflammasome NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles from which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While it was discovered that the betaCoV of bats shares 95% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a CoV of bats that shares 96% of nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that cyvets and other animals in the markets have viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute to genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by man accidentally or intentionally.
CoVs have returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals drastically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in the transmission between humans.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in bats and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in the markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in those markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in the face of the discovery of multiple beta-CoV lineages of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how it is transmitted.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in dromedary for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in the wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurring MERS epidemics, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, the CoVs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more communicable and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotic origin puzzle are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
If it is a bat, pangolim, or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parental viruses will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection of 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and provides a good benchmark for combating this global pandemic.
However, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increases based on constant research findings and experiences in clinical practice; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a commentary on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guides (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially referred to as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is referred to as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has attracted great attention since the publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increases based on the constant findings of research and experience in clinical practice; for this reason, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostics and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in the context in some.
Our guide now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse your meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, your work also needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guides (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspect case, it is necessary to combine an item of the elements of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to comply with three items of clinical manifestations, if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or in other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before the appearance of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 office (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms originating within the city of Wu.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging capabilities of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early stage of symptom onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on suspicious case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the complete viral genome exhibiting high homogeneity with respect to the above new known coronavirus titer; (3) positive for IgM and IgG specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in any major anti-G test phase;
We may note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples was added to the second and third editions (of January 18 and 22, 2020, respectively).
Blood sample pathogenic detection was added to the fourth and fifth editions (from 27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020, respectively), and sorological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the ongoing work of researchers in the search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for quick diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive outcome of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to care for symptomatic and atypical asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, Zhou et al.'s flowchart should be updated, as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be verified in more studies and clinical practices.
To conclude, we await the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspicious case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that you check and follow the latest guidelines of your countries of origin.
Our team will also timely update our guide to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
On yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that remained at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 years of age, and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
She also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital agent told the Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, Bengali minister of road transport and bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport would be paralyzed for longer than initially planned, until next Saturday.
This shutdown of public transport began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
On March 19th, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections in the world
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections worldwide rose from one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea said it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections by Thursday.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. on Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1.
In the national sphere, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to be paid without attending work until April 30.
The parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days. The vote was approved by 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the duration of the curfew in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for the whole day, previously only from 3am to 6pm.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew from 10am to 4pm
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
Australian stores cut limits on toilet paper per transaction
On Saturday evening and Sunday, Australian store networks Woolworths and Coles reduced the restrictions on the purchase of toilet paper, respectively, to two packages and one package per transaction in every store in the country.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a limit of a package.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and Facebook pages of the networks.
For fear of COVID-19, buyers were supposedly stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper with home delivery to one package per order.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packets per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a "sharp increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra inventory, while ALDI advanced inventory from a Wednesday planned promotion.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but that local board restrictions on frequency of deliveries per truck make it difficult.
It expects high production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of the inventory, some stores will not be able to carry out the Wednesday promotion.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenish the stock every night.
He stressed that toilet paper is a bulky item with low numbers in stock in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves too many empty spaces on the shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion that if there were an abundant amount on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be bought and were there in quantities, you would likely reduce panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, stressed that they were working 24 hours a day/7 days a week to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au report.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toiletry paper to the first auction tenders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers entering off on the extended Labour Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a Darwin's daily print, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report on March 3, in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday evening, the British online supermarket Ocado limited Andres toilet paper purchases to two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares a COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus — is a pandemic.
While the word “pandemic” indicates only the degree of spread of a disease, not how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO emphasized the need to push governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is an “unprecedented” pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that “outside influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been monitored from the emergence to continuous global spread.”
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we have never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus."
“And we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time.”
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the U.S. National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said the outbreak, "in summary, will worsen."
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is a continuous 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared an international public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific antiviral vaccine or treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people away and monitoring and isolation of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, cautionary checks, risk controls at the workplace and the closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused a severe global socio-economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and a widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by panic-triggered purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s student population.
Disinformation on the virus spread online and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination occurred against Chinese people, people with offspring and appearance from East and Southeast Asia and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to travel reductions and the closures of the heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia due to unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases were largely linked to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan, and thus the virus is believed to have zoonotic origins.
The outbreak-causing virus is known as SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and that has close links with bat coronaviruses, pangolim and SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms known to be ill became ill on December 1, 2019 and had no visible connections with the subsequent group of the seafood market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two-thirds had a link to the market.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that one case pointed to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, which may have been the first. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as new reported cases decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases out of
There may be a significant understatement of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
As of February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or younger, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The UK’s leading scientific consultant, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive in accordance with official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, until January 23, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, by February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over the age of 60 and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and who had a COVID positive test, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who have died without taking the test, for example, who have died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official count of deaths from COVID by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [official death count] is underestimated," a statement corroborated by episodic reports of understatement in the U.S. This underestimation often occurs in pandemies, such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic in 2009.
The first death outside of China occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Various measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given range.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97,039/1,617.204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the fatality coefficient estimates dropped from 17.3% (in people with symptom onset between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptom onset after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the disease death rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with infection due to a disease, and the percentage of death rate that represents infection.
These statistics are not static in time and follow a specific infection population by resolving the case.
Some academics tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the infection lethality rate for the pandemic, overall, is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
The WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, of Pennsylvania State University, stated that "without due control, infectious epidemics usually reach their peak and then decline when no more hosts are available for the disease.
But it’s almost impossible to make any proper projection at the moment about when this will happen.”
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said it could end by June if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London’s School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine declared that SARS-CoV-2 “likely will continue in circulation for a year or two.”
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will completely disappear, since it is highly communicable" and "it can become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year."
The virulence of the reappearance will depend on group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively inspecific and people infected may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. The WHO states that approximately one in six people becomes severely ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms are difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking and face or lips with blue color. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, therefore, the researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with confirmed infection be monitored and examined closely to rule out the infection.
Chinese estimates of asymptomatic ratio range from some to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of the infection and the symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but usually is five days. As an example of the uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the olfactory sensation was initially 30% and subsequently dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is mainly spread by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or speaking, the close contact being considered 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause the droplets to reach from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have proposed that the virus may also be transmitted by droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing gouts may also be produced during exhalation, including when talking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
The droplets may land in the mouths and noses of nearby people or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in spread through the air.
The spread can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their own eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread through the feces, the risk of this happening is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before symptoms appeared, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects two to three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans, however, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those related to coronavirus in its nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenus Sarbecovirus (line B). Two strains of this same lineage are derived from bats.
It has 96% similarity across the genome to other samples of coronavirus from bats (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the entire genome, so far, has found a maximum of 92% share of genetic material between the pangolim coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms. The definitive confirmation, however, is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized tomography (CT).
A study done in Wuhan comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its image characteristics coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “TC be not used for screening or as a frontline test for COVID-19 diagnosis.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by polymerase reaction and chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually made available from a few hours to days.
Generally, this test is performed in nasopharyngeal rubbing, although the rubbing of the throat is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting the antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these had proven accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Particularities of X-ray and computer tomography (CT) imaging of symptomatic people include asymmetric peripheral matte glass opacities and absence of pleural strokes.
The Italian Radiological Society is gathering an international online database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to overlapping with other adenovirus infections, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR results and showed that while the image is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect characteristics of virus imaging with X-rays and CT.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or sneezing in a paper scarf, and putting this scarf directly into a waste container.
Anyone who has been infected is advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travel going to or coming from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they were infected. Health care professionals who care for individuals who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
Governments’ use of location data from cell phones for this purpose has raised privacy issues, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limitations to this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been deployed or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user’s proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some misconceptions about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as, for example, rinsing the nose and gargling with collutories, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine. However, several organizations are working to develop one.
Washing your hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people frequently wash their hands with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty. Also, you should wash your hands before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective cloak.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol, when there is no soap and water readily available.
The WHO advises you to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (in up to one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% iodopovidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in case of suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 in a location, such as an office or a nursery, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the folded elbow or a paper scarf when coughing or sneezing, as well as immediately discarding any scarf.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of expiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
The WHO has published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, “Wearing masks can reduce people’s propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the largest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene.”
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing the masks can help people not touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming in close contact with another person (stay 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a surgical mask when using public transportation or staying in crowded places.
Thailand’s health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is prohibited to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear facial mask when leaving public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that anyone who enters supermarkets should wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, has demanded that passengers on intercity trains and buses wear face masks from April 1.
In Panama, it is mandatory to wear a mask for the face when going out on the street. At the same time, the production of masks at home was recommended for those who cannot buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the transmission of the disease, by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters or shopping centers.
Social distancing methods can be applied by everyone when staying at home, limiting their travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings and keeping away from others.
Right now, many governments are compelling or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people and subsequently to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany prohibited social meetings of more than two people. The older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems virtually goal are faced with higher risk of severe diseases and complications. WHO has started to replace organs, being advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic. At the end of March 2020, it is the socialist man's's's's's's's's's's's's's's''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to implications that full social isolation was needed rather than encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-insulation. Many governments have demanded or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive autoquarantine instructions were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a broadcast country or region are advised to make 14 days of self-quarantine from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
The containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as present other infection control measures and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are made to reduce it: the measures taken now serve to slow down the spread and reduce its adverse effects on the health system as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time, in combination.
The suppression demands more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic to a basic reproduction rate of less than 1. The management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic. This is what we call the "acquisition of the epidemic curve".
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions that are not of pharmaceutical importance and that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, the use of face masks and self-quartenna were taken on the surface; community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as the closure of schools and the cancellation of events leading to agglomerations; community involvement, in order to encourage acceptance.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and localized quarantines, and the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when carrying out the quarantine and, for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
Simulations conducted in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (decreased contagion speed, unstoppable with the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (i.e. reversing the growth of the epidemic) pose major challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can decrease peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, at the same time overburdening health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as there is the circulation of the virus by the human population or until there is the availability of a vaccine, if this occurs earlier. Otherwise, the transmission will occur again as soon as the relaxation of the measures occurs.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific for COVID-19. However, efforts are being made to develop medicines, which include testing existing medicines.
The use of cold medications that do not need a prescription, drinking plenty of liquid and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, the use of oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids can worsen the condition.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some “home and traditional” drugs can alleviate symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as key measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe issued guidance for hospitals and primary health care services training to move their resources to various levels, including the COVID concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, cancellation of non-mandatory procedures and separation and isolation of patients by positive testing.
There are various theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus dates from December 1, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region has gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a group of patients was observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian, the following Hospital of Control of Hubei Provincial.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were rebuked by police for spreading fake news, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was rebuked by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31 issued a statement to the population and informed the WHO.
Sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to the Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, facilitated by the migration of the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub, as well as a main rail connection point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had already developed the symptoms by January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy, with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The reactions of the countries included containment measures, such as quarantines (also known as home confinement orders, home confinement orders or lockdown) and rescues. On April 2, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are somehow confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, 59 million are confined in the Philippines.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was recorded in Wuhan on December 1, 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests a previous case of November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26. Her hospital reported to the Wuhan Jianghan Disease Prevention and Control Center on December 27.
Initial genetic tests, on December 27, 2019, on samples taken from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronavirus.
A statement to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan’s doctors were warned by police for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there is no "clear evidence" of transmission between humans.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping as a “people’s war” to contain the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the greatest quarantine in human history," a sanitary cord was announced on January 23 to stop round-trip trips to Wuhan, which was extended through 15 cities of Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations on January 25 were cancelled in several locations.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, the Leishenshan, was later built to attend more patients.
Along with the newly built hospitals, China has turned 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention centers and stadiums. On 26 January, the government launched further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health statements for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools throughout the country were also closed.
The regions of Hong Kong and Macau have taken a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
Measures for remote work have been taken in many regions of the country.
Restrictions for travel were made in and outside Hubei.
Public transport has been modified, and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
The control of public movement was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) had undergone some kind of exit restriction. After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict steps to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers arriving in the city. On March 23, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in that case, through a traveller who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Minister announced on March 26, 2020 that the entry of individuals with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28, with no specific details on when this policy will be terminated.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving packages of financial stimuli to companies. The Council of State declared a day of mourning, starting with a moment of three minutes of silence throughout the country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Festival. The central government, however, asked families to pay their physical tributes to the new-surfing-19.
On January 20, 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The country’s national health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
On February 22, among the 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported symptoms. South Korea declared peak alert level on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported, reaching 3,150 on February 29.
All of South Korea’s military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The schedule of the airlines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world in terms of population screening for the virus. The country also isolated the infected people and tracked and quarantined those who come into contact with them.
The screening methods included compulsory individual symptom reporting for those arriving from international travel via a mobile app, drive-thru virus testing, with results available the next day, in addition to increased testing capacity, which allowed up to 20,000 people a day to be tested.
The South Korean program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak, although it has not put entire cities in quarantine. South Korean society was initially divided as to the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans signed petitions requesting Moon’s impeachment on the allegation of government mismanagement of the outbreak, or highlighting his response.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of cases in four weeks.
On March 29, it was announced that from April 1, all new arrivals from abroad should enter quarantine for two weeks.
Through media reports on April 1, South Korea received requests for help with testing the virus from 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has provided five trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that he had no plans for quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities before the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
Amid allegations of cover-up of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their cases related to Iran on February 28 indicating that the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government to that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, with 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch strongly urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders imprisoned for peaceful dissent, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The agency said there is a higher risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions such as detention centers, which also suffer from a lack of medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number since the outbreak in the country.
At least 12 politicians or retired politicians and government officials died from the disease until March 17.
As of March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and one more death every 10 minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there should be five times more cases in Iran than are being reported.
It is suggested that U.S. sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country’s financial ability to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for economic sanctions to be relieved for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise sharply, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A group not associated with COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree-law to contain the outbreak, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In outbreak areas, people are prohibited from entering and leaving.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On March 4, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities in the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A soccer matches, have to be held at closed doors until April, but on March 9, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On 11 March, the Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resurrection and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding the screening protocols that could be employed.

As of April 5, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the region of Lombardy.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test everyone who had the virus until then may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The UK’s response to the virus first emerged as one of the mildest of the affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the UK government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for the recognised lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement advising the discontinuation of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work from home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as soon as possible, and pledged to pay 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of 2,500 pounds a month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On March 23, the Prime Minister announced heavier social distancing measures, preventing crowds with more than two people needed.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions have been reinforced by the police through the issuance of fines and the dispersion of agglomerations.
Most businesses received orders to close, with exceptions for businesses considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and car workshops.

Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start to the tests, which concealed the true extent of the outbreak at that time.
The testing was marked by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of federal approval for non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies, and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested by early March (a medical request was subsequently required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been performed.

The WHO praised Chinese authorities’ efforts to manage and contain the epidemic.
The WHO observed the contrast between the outbreak of SARS 2002-2004, where Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that hindered prevention and restraint efforts, and the current crisis, where the central government “provided regular updates to avoid near-lunar new year panic.”
On January 23, in reaction to the decision of the main authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a recommendation of the WHO" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On January 30, after confirmation of the transmission between humans in other cases
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was invoked due to “the risk of global dissemination, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and displacement."
On February 5, the WHO appealed to the global community for a $675 million contribution to fund strategic preparation in low- and middle-income countries, citing the urgency to assist these countries that "do not have systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, and even if it arises."
Tedros made subsequent statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest link" and asked the international community "invest now or will have to pay later". On February 11, the WHO at a press conference established COVID-19 as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros declared that the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide "the power of the entire United Nations system in response."
The United Nations Crisis Management Team has been activated, as a result, enabling the coordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO declares will allow them to “focus on health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and development implications resulting from the outbreak.”
On 14 February, a WHO Joint Mission Team with China was enabled to provide international and WHO land-based experts in China with aid in domestic management and assess "the severity and communicability of the disease" through workshops and meetings with major national-level institutions and conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities on provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panoramas".

Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergencies program, warned in a statement that “This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: Wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst."
Ryan also stated that the current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On March 11, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said the WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction." The WHO faced many criticisms for what has been seen as an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The reaction included a petition to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom to present his resignation, signed by 733,000 people on April 6.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone is entitled to life-saving interventions and that the government is responsible.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts noted that each individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, minorities, elderly people, people with mental problems, homeless people, those living in extreme poverty, people imprisoned, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.

The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Province-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired because of their approach to quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent in the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe this action was aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, rejected an early recognition of the coronavirus outbreak that began in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
Donald Trump’s U.S. administration referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese Virus” or “Wuhan Virus” saying that China’s censorship “overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic,” which was, in turn, condemned by some critics such as racism and “a way to divert the failure in the administration to contain the disease.”
The Daily Beast obtained from a U.S. government cable a detailed scheme of communication with apparent backgrounds in the National Security Council, with a strategy being quoted as “This has everything to do with China.
“Channels such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have indicated that China’s efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for global influence.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a tendentious point of view and "politics of generosity."
Borrell also said that “China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner.”
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.
The Jack Ma donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was blocked by U.S. sanctions on April 3.

He hears disputes related to masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union’s lack of solidarity with those affected by the coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the European Union, said: “Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous “high-level political source” that 80 percent of Russia’s supplies were “useless or useless for Italy.”
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “By offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good phase, they would also act reciprocally if necessary.”
NATO’s planned military exercise “Defender 2020” in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, NATO’s largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts the lives of not only the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate."
Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders, calling for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, and paid family leave.
Political analysts anticipated that this could negatively affect Donald Trump’s chances of re-electing himself as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan’s ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized over President Moon Jae-in’s response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions calling for Moon’s impeachment of those they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising his response. The pandemic allowed countries to pass emergency laws in response.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those considered to have spread fake news about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The Coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for several cases of shortages of supplies, resulting from increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The U.S. Food and Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier interruptions.
Several locals also experienced the panic-driven shopping event which led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned of delays in shipping electronics.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, demand for personal protection equipment has risen 100 times.
This demand led to a rise in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also induced delays in the supply of medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment around the world, with WHO warning that this would jeopardize workers’ health.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, Daigou, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food, both areas were spared from acute food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortage that was predicted in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural output did not notice a large decrease, but prices can rise according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were only temporarily found, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released stockpiles of pork to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was heavily hit in the first two months of 2020 due to steps taken by the government to shorten the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since Continental China is a major economy and manufacturing center, the viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist’s intelligence unit predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of possible outcomes emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could surpass the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate from an expert at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated a $300 billion impact on the world’s supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) is reportedly "confused" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock exchange indices including the NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones industry average showed their most sharp falls since 2008, with Dow falling by 1,191 points, the biggest drop in a day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indices ended the week with a low of more than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH stated China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative perspective.
Stocks fell again based on concerns about the coronavirus, the largest drop on March 16.
Many consider it a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised early emergency measures by states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they have reacted to the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including sights, and government recommendations against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines canceled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise sector was of an unseen level.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major travel station associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivals, with private companies also independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass clusters, including the Beijing Forbidden City and traditional temple events.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities have extended the New Year’s holiday to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country’s GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year's celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in shop schedules or temporary closures.
Visits to resellers in Europe and Latin America fell 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a decline of 50-60%.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping malls in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would occur in situations without the pandem.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China’s 300 million migrant rural workers were abandoned at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government aid.
The Coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The confinement in India 2020 left tens of millions of workers migrants in India (which are paid through daily pay) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of their families are unemployed.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment aid and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit program. Nearly half a million companies in Germany placed their workers under government-subsidiated reduced-hour work programmes known as Kurzabeit.
The German reduced-time work compensation program was adopted by France and Britain.
Performing art and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting organizations’ operations as well as people – both employed and independent – worldwide.
Arts and culture industry organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and help artists where possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, bookshops, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have taken place to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and high-accelerating repercussion of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion events.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week rites in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that elderly Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches offered church services via radio, live streaming online or television while others offer drive-in cults.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the empty St. Peter's Square without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and limited public clusters in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and sanctuaries were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their residents in sacred sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption on the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "re-scheduled for a date after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021."
This led many players to play online, with various online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new enrollment rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with several music groups suspending or cancelling their tours.
Many major theaters like Broadway also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work on the internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming shows or creating online "festivals" for artists to present, share and disseminate their work.
Online, several memes on the internet about coronavirus are spread as many seek humor and entertainment amidst uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism aimed at people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people from focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Results from February (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserve the virus or being getting fair punishment for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many inhabitants of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in areas affected by the virus.
Following the outbreak in new outbreaks, citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious COVID-19 outbreak, could also be subject to distrust and xenophobia.Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed sick petitions pressuring Chinese entry ban with attempts in their countries.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to Twitter’s Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, like other Asians in the UK and the United States, have reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has been criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus,” a term critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuated Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students coming from northeastern India, which borders China, and students in large cities in India allegedly suffered persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, said the Chinese destroyed nature and "that's why God turned against them."
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called it "mistakes". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign garbage" and "disposal" targets.
Many newspapers with paid access have removed them from some or all coverages about the coronavirus.
Several scientific publishers have made available open-access outbreak-related scientific papers.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings as soon as possible on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS - CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and developed only to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to be reported or who became asymptomatic.
A precise rate of disease mortality and herd immunity level in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, in March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
On March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests performed in the countries.
This variability is likely to still substantially affect the mortality rates of recorded cases, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharynx rubbing or saliva sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with scrubbing of the pharynx is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be removed from the bottom of the airways by suction catheter or material expelled by expectoration (secretion) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It looks for the Corona "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp laboratory, specific of SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive approval for emergency use by China's National Medical Products Administration for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, its ReC Control Center
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits generated inconclusive reagent tests, and a barrier to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then were local and state laboratories allowed to initiate the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made the COVID-19 tests available nationally from March 9, 2020.
No quantity restrictions have been announced; sampling and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an approval from the FDA for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a wide scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-houring period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (US) for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a U.S. FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses the technology of isothermic nucleic acid amplification rather than PCR.
As it does not require a number of alternating temperature cycles, this method can generate positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and particularly binds it to the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of delivering results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a fast flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that “chest x-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT findings, computed tomography, may be present even before symptoms arise.”
Typical characteristics in CT include bilateral multilobaric opacities in matte glass with a subsequent, peripheral and asymmetric distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its image aspects coinciding with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals started 7 days ago or soon after symptoms arise, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring. Trials can be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by means of remote laboratory tests (PoCT).
High-productivity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection step is not required before the test. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency as required, and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an authorization for emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
The antibodies are typically detected 14 days after the onset of the infection. Earlier in April, the UK considered that none of the acquired antibody test kits were suitable enough to be used.
Hong Kong has organized a system in which suspect patients can stay at home, "emergency department will give a sampling tube to the patient", they must expel saliva in the tube, send it back to health and get a result shortly after. The British NHS has announced that it is coordinating a system to test suspect cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infect others if they go to hospital.
In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Doctors stated on March 2 that it had a capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, with 10,700 being tested the previous week.
The costs are borne by the health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in tests have been offered in several major cities.
Since March 26, 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020, a total of 483,295 samples were tested in the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam hospitals have developed and tested a method to test samples of only 64 patients, gathering the samples simulta.
With the construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, modeling revealed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with quarantine would have doubled if that testing capacity did not have an online access.
The Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily income was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed models released by Origami Assays were launched as capable of testing up to 1,122 samples of patients for COVID-19, using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be executed in small laboratories without the need for robotic manipulators for liquids.
In March, shortages or insufficient amounts of reagent became a barrier to mass testing in the European Union, the UK and the US.
This led some authors to study the sample preparation protocols involving warming the samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genomes for additional tests. On March 31, it was reported that the UAE are now doing more tests per inhabitant in their population for Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on track to increase the level of testing.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capability, and the acquisition of a mass-scale processing laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (inspired by their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world to operate outside of China.
Different test methods aimed at different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted Germany’s method for manufacturing kits shipped to low-income countries that do not have resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the U.S. Center for Disease Control was not available until January 28, there was delay in testing available for the U.S. and for China and the U.S. faced problems with the reliability of test kits right at the beginning of the outbreak, in addition, these countries together with Australia were unable to provide enough test kits to meet the demand and recommendations.
On the other hand, experts say that South Korea’s widespread availability for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to slow the advancement of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and the supply of cottonets and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems accurately in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by CDC showed "faults"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the private tests. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the results inaccurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure to collect samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish minister said he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China generated wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million test kits from China considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they would be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and would not "use them". The UK acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced they were not useful.
The testing, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom SARS-CoV-2 positive people had contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two stages of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with a interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all of the cases discovered were placed in quarantine.
With the displacement to the commune restricted, this completely eliminated new infections.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 in Singapore has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began seriously advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened as planned after the holidays on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, had lower mortality rates, probably because those countries are more able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of WHO’s 16 reference laboratories for confirmative tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % of tests" is influenced by the testing policy of the countries.
A country that tests only hospitalized people will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing your hands with the purpose of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oro-faecal route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or a common cold, for example if they don’t wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., the mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing your hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning your child’s buttock or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling raw meat, frank or fish.
If water and soap are not available, your hands can be hygienized with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hygienizing your hands:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animal, feed or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main goal of washing your hands is to clean your hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical area, but is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and decreasing the infant mortality rate in home deliveries.
A 2013 study revealed that best practices for hand washing can lead to slight improvements in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce episodes of diarrhea by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water for poor areas.
48% of the reductions in episodes of diarrhoea may be associated with soap hand washing. Soap hand washing is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (IRA), such as automatic behaviour performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the primary IRA, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, turning hand washing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhea deaths by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections in a quarter.
Hand washing is usually associated with other sanitary interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (WASH) programs.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin injuries as a function of the dryness of the skin.
A Danish 2012 study found that excessive hand washing can cause a skin peeling and irritation condition known as hand eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical moments during the day when washing your hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (miction, defecation), after cleaning a child's buttock (swapping diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations where the right technique for hand washing should be practiced in order to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing or blowing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of soap hand washing.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of the families had the habit of washing their hands with soap in countries. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest index with 97 percent; the United States of America near the average hand washing period; and China with the lowest index with 23 percent. Various methods for behaviour changes exist to increase the labouring.
The “Essential Health Services Program” implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children’s health and education.
The deparasiting twice a year, complemented by hand washing daily with soap, the brushing of teeth daily with fluoride, are at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleansing agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, organic dirt components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning, however, is facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated soap bar concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic controls for dosage is preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been widely disseminated to the health-conscious public.
So far, there is no evidence that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can lead to the selection of antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even though antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to the surfactants and skin protection agents, the complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as the final pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other skin hydrating diseases containing common bacteria (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, vegetable extracts).
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 oC).
However, hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water to remove the natural oil that retains dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on hands.
A hand hygienizer or antiseptic is a non-aqueous base hand hygienizing agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous hand hygienizing agents (also known as alcohol-based hand hygienizing product, antiseptic hand hygienizing product, or hand hygienizing product) are beginning to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a humectant, such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers that contain a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 logarithm reduction, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of the bacteria on the hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduced from 4 to 5 logarithms) of the bacteria on the hands 1 minute after their application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus-type virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptic hands or alcohol-based sanitizers can be used to moisturize or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and their extremities are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be thoroughly washed, rubbing with the two palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizers, especially when the hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid extermination action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dryness of the skin, unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Contact allergic dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in alcohol-based hand sanitizers rarely occur.
The lesser tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis has become an attractive compared to hand washing with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous base agents do not clean the hands of organic matter, only disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as water and soap for preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically has been far short of alcohol and alcohol-based sanitizers.
More recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride have revealed to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which showed to have reduced efficacy after recurring use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions on the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ash or land.
Gray or earth may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the land or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct technique for hand washing recommended by the U.S. Center for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Rinse your hands with cold or hot running water.
Current water is recommended as fixed sinks may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not appear to be relevant.
Rub your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of pure water.
Grind for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing in a sink can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let it dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and sliced enamel can shelter microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin injuries capable of increasing the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, pouring water from a gallon or cook with proper holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with restricted water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions for storing water, such as "low-cost screws" and other improved options.
An improvised faucet is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a lever driven by the feet to pour a small amount of water into the hands and a soap bar.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
A growing volume of research suggests that towel papers are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by the paper towel, heated air hand dryers and the most modern air-jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying your hands with dryer with heated air, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the area of the palm near the fingers and 254% in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air jet dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, by 42% in the area of the palm near the fingers and by about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the area of the palm near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. The researchers also conducted tests to determine whether there was potential cross-contamination among other users and the bathroom environment as a consequence of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which ejects air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and unit potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment within up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hand dryer with hot air spreads microorganisms to up to 0.25 meters of the dryer.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in the bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers were compared to drying with paper towel.
Hand washing with wet hand cleaners is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical hand washing became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates have decreased with its use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soap and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the intertwining of the fingers.
If there is waste under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can remain in the water in your hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the faucet (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thereby transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that adequate hand washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the standard of hand washing and friction in healthcare sectors.
The organization’s hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if the regulatory compliance demonstration is required.
The World Health Organization defines "Five Moments" for Hand Washing:
after exposure to body/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap (“medicinal” or “antimicrobial” soaps) confers an exterminating action on a hand washing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" your hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed cleaning without touching it with your hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine antiseptics instruments, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, and others for this washing.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not run into the hands.
After hand washing is finished, the hands are wiped with a sterile towel and the surgical robe is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after attending a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a little significant additional benefit was obtained when the frequency of cleaning exceeded 35%.
Common soap washing more than triples the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food compared to washing with an antibacterial soap. Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that an anti-alcohol-based hand hygienizer reduced 26% more bacteria contamination
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce the influenza virus A, H1N1, and spores of Clostridium difficile in the hands. Interventions to increase the hygiene of the hands in hospital environments can involve team awareness about hand washing, increased availability of hand sanitizers and writing hands to the hands.
There is a need for more research on which interventions are most efficient in different healthcare establishments.
In developing countries, soap hand washing is considered an essential economically viable tool to have good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable water sources, soap or hand washing resources in people’s homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the achievement of the universal practice of hand washing.
For example, in most rural Africa hand-washing taps near any public or private toilets are rare, although there are cheap options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low rates of hand washing may instead be the result of rooted habits and not the absence of soap and water.
The encouragement and advocacy of soap hand washing can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to a long-term change in population behavior.
In order for this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand washing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, other requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to three maximum stars.
The construction of stations for hand washing can be a part of the promotional campaigns for hand washing carried out with the aim of reducing diseases and infant mortality.
World Hand Wash Day is another example of an awareness campaign that tries to achieve a habit change. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF has released the adoption of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies considered the overall cost-benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries to DALY classification.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting soap hand washing is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health—especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals—was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the founder.
At that time, people still believed that the infections were caused by unpleasant odors called myasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and infections associated with health care led the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "techniques for proper hand washing" were hanged near sinks for hand washing in public toilets and in toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression “washing your hands” means declaring reluctance to take responsibility or to be convinced with something.
It originates from the Bible passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but became a more generally used phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience about the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and usually attach more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other “clean-up” acts, such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe hand washing for hygienical and symbolic purposes. The symbolic hand washing, using water, but not soap, to wash the hands is part of a ritual hand washing characteristic in many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, the tevilah and the netildayim washing in the Judea.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam allow hand washing after using the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam allow hand washing before and after meals.
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Hazard controls at work for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies for hazard controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate hazard controls in the workplace depend on the workplace and the work itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to COVID-19 contracting.
According to the Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), functions at lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including washing their hands, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are ill, maintaining a breathing label and a workplace cleaning and disinfection routine.
Average risk of exposure functions include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known whether they are contaminated or suspected of COVID-19 contamination, but may be infected due to existing community transmission or having travelled abroad.
This includes workers who keep in touch with the general public such as in schools, high density workplaces, and in the large-volume retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include used ventilation of high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and the availability of personal protective equipment in case a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health system and morgue workers exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to too high if workers perform procedures in people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 aerosol generation and collect or handle specimens of those people.
Adequate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protective equipment suitable for the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have several workplace effects.
Workers may be absent from work because they are ill, because they have to take care of others, or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trading patterns can change, both in terms of which products are in demand and the means of purchasing those products (such as making purchases off peak hours or by delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, the dispatch of items from severely affected areas of COVID-19 may be discontinued. A plan of action and preparation for infectious disease may be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and individual workers’ risk factors such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the necessary controls to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action plans and preparedness for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The goals for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at higher risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a structure widely used in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
Where the hazards of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without counting on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require the action of the worker or employer.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PEI must be selected based on the hazard to the worker, properly adjusted as needed (e.g. breathers), used properly and continuously, regularly inspected, preserved and replaced as needed, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed properly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Occupational Safety (OSHA), low risk of exposure work has minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and meticulous hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill and the use of respiratory label, including covering workers sneezing and coughing, preparing containers for handkerchiefs and common garbage, preparing workers for remote work or ladder use.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of medications to reduce fever or relief from other symptoms, and also recommends that a member's home licensing policies for illness allow them to be flexible.
According to OSHA, work with average risk of exposure includes those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known whether they are confirmed patients or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission at the company’s location, or because the individual has a recent history of traveling abroad in a country with high COVID-19 transmission.
This includes the workers of contact with the general public as in schools, the workplaces of high density of the population, the workplaces of protection and some retail shops of high volume of sales, the workers of protection and the workplaces of protection and the workplaces of protection, the workplaces of protection and the workplaces of protection and the workplaces of protection, the workplaces of protection and the workplaces of protection.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person gets sick on a plane, adequate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from the other people for a distance of 6 feet, with the designation of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer him a facial mask, or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with scarves when coughing or sneezing.
The crew should wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protection equipment if the patient has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items must be discarded in a bag for biologically hazardous waste, and contaminated surfaces must be then cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other vessels with passengers, hazard controls include the delay of the journey by the sick passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical center on board if someone has fever or other symptoms.
For schools and child care centres, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has been present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groupings such as physical education lessons or corals, or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between tables, stricter arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors and using a separate healthcare site for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, prolonged school dispenses can be considered. For law enforcement authorities performing daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who come into contact with individuals suspected of COVID-19 or with the confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protection equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers must clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PEI and for the containment and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers certain health and morgue workers to be in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
High risk of exposure functions include drug delivery, medical care, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some procedures and dental examinations or invasive sampling of specimens.
Work in high-exposure mortuaries include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of people with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure makes it too high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected of the disease, including when aeros are generating procedures.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be suitable in some morgue scenarios and in the healthcare area.
Specimens should be handled with caution from level 3 of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the hospital be separated into two separate waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspicious case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working at a distance of 6 feet from patients with confirmation or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 particle filtered facial respirators, approved by NIOSH or top quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment tests, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend wearing suits, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
The WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening staff at the entry point.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, glasses or facial protection, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Since the overall supply of PPEs is insufficient, the WHO recommends minimizing the need for PPEs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE required for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator by even removing the diagnosis of PPEs.

LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have to each other clear.
Their challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go along with global empathy, cooperation, and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
The fellowship and concern we have seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls, and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings we have the privilege of working with.
I am immensely grateful and proud to have you all as coworkers.
Last week, someone shared with me his appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful it is for this essential feature to remain online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible because you keep the workplaces active, pay our co-workers, and keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do, will have a significant impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, beginning next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, C team gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the coming days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think is an appropriate action to what we are experiencing and the best way to maintain sustainable organization during this period.
We want to end stress and support our mission in the long term.
If you need to leave for a while, it's okay.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise is arranged.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you can work at normal hours, it may be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to take care of loved ones, buy food, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
This rule wouldn't even have to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
Just tell your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure key areas of work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification industry so that his industry can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention.)
The employees who work per hour will receive the full payment.
We have said this before, and we are committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and employees who work hourly.
Everyone will receive their salary based on their normal work record under normal circumstances.
Wages depend on whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give you full support.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress due to the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask you to communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to carry out.
Site Reliability, HR, Reliability and Security and Fundraising Engineering teams (among others) perform essential activities that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current goals and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is a lot to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now will not harm us in the future.
We do not intend to “work double to recover lost time” after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now unpracticable.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees prioritize essential work, personal care, and care for loved ones, while accommodating those in need or want to work on a shorter day in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their leadership in this process.
Office Status, Exposure and Cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, by precaution, we employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance lobby and all lifts that give access to our floor.
The building is employing its own care duties protocol using products that are safe for its attendees.
We were relieved by the fact that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located at a WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all Washington employees.
Last week, our office in Washington moved to a fully remote setting, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we’re also discussing renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but they can be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely for a long time know it can be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider dividing them into several days.
Set the meeting, have a schedule and send materials for reading in advance.
Use videos as default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection.
Have a leader to make meetings easier, someone to monitor questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel to chat with colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to help increase remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editing marathons, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We warned you that we understood that our cancellation request and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete your agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying your goals.
Next week, we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The overall feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with the paralysis, but also of relief with the clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and other situations.
The communication resources team is working on creating a page on the Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping up to date on COVID-19-related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with staff.
We will use that time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The communications capabilities team will update these pages and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries today.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or about the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, be sure to notify and work with the communication resources team.
We are here to help you provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, send an email to Bryan Judan, HR Global Operations Director.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that at this time our work and obligations will likely need to adapt in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are needed as support right now, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service on which it depends.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it’s time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably months to come.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need everyone to take care of you and your family so that you are in your best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, communication resources team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the angiotensin-related converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug targeted for cardiovascular disease treatment. ECA2 also functions as a point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme is a metalloenzyme that contains zinc located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal amino acid and collectrin transport domain in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single-passage type 1 membrane protein, with its enzyme-active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted into the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of major type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, artery and venous endothelial cells, and smooth artery muscle cells in most organs.
The expression of ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striate body, hypothalamus, and brain trunk.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a balance for the ECA.
ACE cleaves the type I angiotensin hormone into type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn cleaves carboxyterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses in vasodilating angiotensin (1-7).
ECA2 also cleaves several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, appelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greline.
ECA2 also regulates transport through the membrane of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and has been involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV S1 and SARS-CoV2 spike protein to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosoms located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the protein S by the host serine-protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help in combating infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing with the ACE inhibitor standard and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls.”
"The risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a high risk of contracting pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia.”
Human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamic and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory anguish syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of the effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is high.
COVID-19 applications are mobile software applications to assist monitoring in response to the coronavirus pandemic 2019-2020, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") that may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several structures for creating contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues have been raised, mainly on systems based on tracking the geographic location of users of the app.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user’s proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with a COVID-19 carrier.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and offer a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government declared that the contact tracking app was in advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar app is planned for Ireland, and for France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand predict applications based on Singapore’s TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographical delimitation app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don’t leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the application acceptance is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about spreading fake or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple sets limits to the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to your App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits to this type of surveillance.
The organizations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should prevent the aggravation of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and citizens’ rights to respond to abuse;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published checklists. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created to use central servers for intercom only (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to run contact tracking.
Instead of using a unique app, the system gathered tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text messages for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made the location information publicly available, which is allowed due to the comprehensive changes to the confidentiality of information laws after the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy preservation system and the centralized system.
Until April 6, 2020, the details had not yet been disclosed.
Contact tracking preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on privacy-respecting solutions, with the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user’s proximity to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that encompasses centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) and Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Tracing (ACT).
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy preservation techniques during the collection and use of location data or cross-track data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research based on the technical publication "Apps gamble dirty: keeping personal privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a heavyweight that develops privacy technologies and originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and responsible, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On April 5, 2020, the TCN Global Coalition was founded by groups that united around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the official government app, became open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, claiming they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system envisages implementation in three stages:
development of tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking apps while preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to tackle the persistent and assumed surveillance issues by first distributing the system by running system updates, and later removing it in the same way as soon as the threat ends.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug repositioning, reperphilation, reassignment or therapeutic replacement) is the repositioning of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and COVID-19 vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drugable proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these binding points provides the reasonable design of developing antiviral drug effective against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds which he later perfected and analyzed for their structural similarities with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in his pre-clinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York state chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine trials would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized through the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors said they are using the drug when “there is no other option.”
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and effectiveness of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have stated that favipiravir was “clearly effective.”
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to support the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to store it and use the army to hand it over to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the Trump administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease, when the virus has already multiplied.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication through protease binding.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to replicate drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences discovered that remdesivir exhibited antiviral activity in vitro against edge, pneumonia, paramyx and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which can cause transmissions or more serious diseases.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate illness and one for those with more severe illness.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for people hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19: two of them are placebo-controlled (in China and Canada), while the other has no control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical test of Alvesco (ciclesonide) by Teijin, a company that is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The aim is to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with an angiotensin 2 converting enzyme type is ongoing with 200 patients to be recruited among serious hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Currently, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are researching the function of colchicin in reducing lung complications and inflammations in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women who are breastfeeding or who do not use effective contraceptive methods have not been included in the tests.
Several anticoagulants are tested in Italy.
Heparin, low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidance on use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients is analyzing the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylaxis and in therapeutic dosages. The study was announced on April 14, in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable to give new purpose to antiviral drugs approved and developed for the treatment of previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of COVID-19 patients:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus disease vaccine (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical trials completed, there are several attempts ongoing to develop it.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A large spread of the outbreak occurred in 2020, which led to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes for the development of possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The initiative of the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation, CEPI, declared in April that the needs for the development of the vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and developed during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The goals of the largest platforms that advanced for Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). Another 37 were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered in planning or being projected).
A Phase I-II test performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicenter, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in avoiding the disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 actively developing vaccine candidates (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (they continue in pre-clinical research).
On January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular clip, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the aim of testing on humans in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the China Center for Disease Prevention and Control on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Pharmaceutical Companies Janssen, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotech partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine with similar technology used for neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immnuno-Oncology, announced that they were initiating a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested on humans “in the next 90 days.”
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command in Fort Detrick and the U.S. Army Research Institute Walter Reed in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.

in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for the pre-clinical trial and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at a speedy step, it would take at least a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a Coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The candidate for the vaccine is in laboratory research, with human tests planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian declared that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine” under protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently undergoing pre-clinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could leave for human testing in the autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition of Innovations in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for the COVID-19 vaccine involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI’s total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine to $29 million.
CEPI’s other investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing on animals of six different candidates for the vaccine.
Researchers at Imperial College in London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The candidate for the vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequencing from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the test of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines that sparked potent responses of antigen-specific antibodies after [in mice] that were evident to start in 2 weeks."
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of the Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the preparation of a candidate for a DNA-based vaccine as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities brought together resources to access IBM’s supercomputers, in combination with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google’s cloud computing.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A subsequent randomized test in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers.
Vaccines in development may not be safe or effective.
Early research to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using specimens of COVID-19-specific animals, such as the ACE2-transgenic rat, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosafety containment measures to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have already been tested on non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has proved safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became predominant, existing SARS research was believed to provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was a vaccine against MERS (DNA-based) that completed phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are vaccines vectorized by viruses, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectored by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
The 2019 Betacoronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some evolve into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
The virus is spread among people mainly during direct contact, usually through droplets produced by cough, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when they exhale, they usually fall to the ground or fall on surfaces rather than remain infectious at long distances.
People can also get infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread may be possible before the symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase (RT-PCR) chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people with suspicion of the virus and for people responsible for its care.
Recommendations for the use of a mask by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend not use, some recommend use and others require use.
Currently, there is no specific antiviral vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop symptoms similar to flu, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty staying awake, bluish face or lips.
Less common, symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, running nose or sore throat can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed at different percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only tightness in the chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease can evolve into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The function these asymptomatics play in the transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who have no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1, of 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking loud releases more droplets than speaking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering the mouth can cause the droplets to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally transported by air, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in corridors outside of people's rooms contained positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted through the air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through the stool, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease is spread, usually one person infects one or two. The virus survives for hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in 99% copper.
This depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Soap products degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, deactivating it, in addition to removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the onset of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus of acute respiratory syndrome that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia that were related to a group of cases of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin 2 converter enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury was observed in 12% of infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to bad prognosis. Necropsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for epithelial cells of the respiratory tract that express ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it has been shown that the pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF correlate with the recruitment of IL-6 secretor inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in the necropsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard testing method is the chain reaction of polymerase via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by means of a nasopharyngeal swab, however, a nasal swab or catarrh sample can be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) were under development but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with the testing showed that their accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacities in matte multilobar bilateral glass with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thick lobular septs with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and multinuclear giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) with diffuse alveolar exsudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular clotting (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a scarf when coughing or sneezing, as well as covering your mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the scarf is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit the transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public meetings.
Distancing guidelines also include that people stay at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) away from each other.
There is no known effective drug for COVID-19 prevention. Since the vaccine should not be released before 2021, a key point for COVID-19 control is to try to lower the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curve buying".
The CDC also recommends that individuals frequently wash their hands using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using alcohol-based hand antiseptic with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For locations where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is obtained by means of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not “an active substance for hand asepsis.”
Glycerol is added as a humidifier.
People are treated through palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are with the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under review.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments can be helpful for those with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection. The WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive doctors and pneumologists from the U.S. have gathered treatment recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some healthcare professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation are being carried out.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with insulation from airborne infections (SIIA) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PIE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPI blanket, respirator or facial mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of facial masks.
N95 breathers are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has approved the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against air particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When the masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be prevented with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive pressure in the airways at two levels.
Whether any of these two leads to the same benefits for people who are severely ill is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits aerosol particles to spread, compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in elderly (those over 60 and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the health system’s ability to deal with the sudden escalation in the number of serious COVID-19 cases enough to demand hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive therapy units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans that have pressure control mode and high level of PEEP are required to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung and pneumothorax injuries associated with ventilation.
High level of PEEP may not be available in older fans.
Research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials are being done with various antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to be developed, several of the drugs tested have already been approved for other uses or are in advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medication can be tested on people with various diseases.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the tests for the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of plasma from convalescent people as a treatment in cases where the life of the person is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies required to show their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been carried out.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users are asked to provide their name and ID number.
The app can detect "near contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities. Big data analyses of cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and people they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to trace mobile phone data from people allegedly infected with coronavirus.
The measure has been taken to strengthen quarantine and protect people who can come into contact with infected citizens.
Even in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate phone location data with the German federal agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect those who fail to comply with quarantine.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by cell phone operators that "40 percent of people continue to circulate anyway."
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackatone on the weekend with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid has made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience quarantine difficulties, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O’Connor as saying, “The increase in social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have a mild evolution, with few or no symptoms, appearing to be other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with serious or critical illness can take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of serious COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but lack COVID-19 data. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of hospitals with COVID-19, while kidney failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between symptom emergence and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median manifestation of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-mortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exsudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung imaging looked like acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic factors in a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality due to comorbidity vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Understatement of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die, compared to non-smokers. Concerns were raised about long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital authority saw a 20 to 30 percent drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worsening of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin, through overflow infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but, as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by the transmission from human to human.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of symptom emergence was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of symptoms appearance as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned the ICD-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, no laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall mortality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) on April 17, 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not restricted to time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread through Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths should have been formally recorded as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had confirmed COVID-19 death.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the age of 50, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the gender difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immune differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women, and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to the higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men, and 72% of the deaths from COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking sex-related COVID-19 infections data.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, flu and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, mainly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the disease’s official name was “COVID-19”.
WHO head Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is of "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", of disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 was called the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "Covid-19 virus" and "Covid-19 virus" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended “2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease” as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 guideline against the use of sites in names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material such as nasopharyngeal snails and respirator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on the required schedule, a local startup reverse engineered and printed the 100 necessary valves overnight.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which rapidly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study could not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is ongoing in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with the most likely effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing candidates for the vaccine.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine with the whole virus.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spinal protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody dependent improvement has been pointed out as a possible challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There have been more than 300 clinical trials ongoing since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs makes up most of Chinese research, with nine phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries due to a late April report.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was underway in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There has been an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with remdesivir by compassionate use.
Phase III clinical tests are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for parity review of the survey.
Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be further studied in vivo after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spinal protein in preparation for serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have great limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-storm properties of cytokine. Tocilzumabe was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the completion of a small study.
An unrandomized Phase 2 test is underway in Italy after demonstrating positive results in people with the serious disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered the cause of death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumabe is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who recovered from COVID-19 to people in need of them is being investigated as a non-vaccinatory method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of heavily related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
