A Republican strategy to counter Obama’s re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth by reaffirming that the election fraud in the U.S. is less rare than the number of people killed by the lightning.
The Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures are partially undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting elections in individual states.
In this sense, the majority of U.S. governments have been enacting new laws since 2009 that make it more difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, declare the right to register as voters on the day of the election invalid, and grant citizens the right to vote for which a court act is available.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, in 2012, five million new voters did not have such an identity card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to get the required ID card.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected by young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes even further.
Students who are regarded as voters who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations who vote more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state demanded proof of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws demanding that voters prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic votes.
It is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators in eight states in 2011 endorsed laws that abolished voter registration on the day of the election.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the 2004 general elections helped to register approximately 10 million citizens.
As a result of the measures adopted since 2009, the share of new voter registration in 2010 has decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the time for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general elections, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, although they make up only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter represented only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the whites, which represented 76% of the voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the veto of the democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed legislation that requires the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the political nature of the passed laws and see it as a clear goal to influence the results in the decisive states for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voting participation.
In this sense, these measures are partially undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Early prostate cancer detection: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes shows faulty results, with false negative or even false positive results, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater hesitation by the already undecided men for conducting early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have seen the opinion of two specialists.
There were numerous interference factors between control groups in the U.S. studies, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that with a follow-up after 12 years, the probability of metastases forming is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40, respectively, if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer is detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be truly understood the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancers can remain untreated if he does not impair the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases he is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have detected cancer do not have treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and offered treatment if the disease progresses.
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be treated are determined.
That is why I still recommend the test.
But most importantly, talk to your doctor to determine whether it should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that allows us to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle remedy to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting ill.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eats well and moves adequately.
“If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, about 10% of cancers are expected to be caused by inheritance.
Several are also completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, fighting tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely damages people’s health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up on the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, gut, mast, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against grim colon cancer,” he adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In excessive amounts, it increases the risk of developing a grim or mast-color cancer.
Sausage should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are not conclusive at present.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly shown.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his pre-family burden.
“Taking an early detection test does not lead to cancer.”
The Higgs Boson
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson has sparked some upset last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model - our best or " least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is not entirely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still a lack of data to be completely secure about it.
Let’s still assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of misleading yourself, and let’s look at what it’s about.
There is inevitably an inevitable law in this world which causes that two objects cannot be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too strongly as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it also applies to such a law: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state", with this "state" consisting largely of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, referred to as Fermione, who obey the Pauli principle.
And on the other hand, the bosons are moving, an evil band of anarchists to whom nothing is holy - definitely not this principle, which means that they can in fact be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which is absolutely amazing by the way) these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "boat" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, if a particle accelerates with an electrical charge or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at this exact location, about like a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "disruption" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the "bearers of force" bosons.
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "disturbed" in order for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a little comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be frightened by a very large rock.
That’s why a huge particle accelerator like CERN is needed – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! – to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don’t – for example, a sheet of paper would never keep it on its own on the refrigerator.
And in the same way not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do possess a mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) do not possess a mass.
What can all this research be "good" for now, asks Ms. Plamondon?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to carefully investigate all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are, by the way, numerous physicists who desperately hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has large shortcomings, as it does not provide an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at CERN so far.
Impact
The effects of this research on the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were no.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who in 1962 himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) - has already told us that the laser was considered at first rather as a "laboratory play".
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also result from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and received the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
Of course, this doesn’t mean that the activities of LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you can really never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
With her committee for "Deaths in Dignity", Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still much to be done in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had given him a two-year period.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he agrees to be helped with dinner.
Bravely, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is that my diarrhea be healed, as this is humiliating,” he said.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
“During our lives, we learn that a man is standing pishing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
“This depends on the person’s ability to take a step back,” he notes.
Because, according to several people who work in palliative care, major events take place amidst these steps backwards.
Patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overcrowded with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who take care of them.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by choking."
But because of the illness, I really got to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I no longer have any desires in life,” she says before she accepts to put on a mask that helps her breathe.
In the coming days, she expects a last visit of her son, who comes from Italy.
In the home Victor-Gadbois you can offer a group of volunteer personal care and help with the intake of food.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11,700 inhabitants have a bed for palliative care.
That’s very little if you take into account that one day we’ll all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the house’s doctors.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on the desire, the dying person is given an oral care with brandy or pepsi.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday night we served Mr. X a beer that died overnight.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We are helping relatives and patients alike,” says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, no day is like the other.
Besides a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family gathering in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows as one pushes to his honour, a 36-year-old man surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children dies in a tragic way after trying everything to survive.
“For six months, three to five beds have always been filled with cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to a care that is meant to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, either at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that ensures that several physicians specializing in palliative care await with concerns the passing of a law regulating death aid and assisted suicide.
A manifesto has been in circulation since October, signed by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their contradiction to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s healthcare system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to a high-quality palliative care before accepting to pass on to death relief.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain without taking any measures to relieve her.
I’m afraid that patients want to die only because they don’t get adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst predictions to the last day.
Hélène Richard’s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued compelling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to discontinue the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped the fight.
She told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who asked to die thank the nurse for not meeting this wish after their pain was alleviated by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly stated that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, Head of Palliative Care of the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Greater Montreal area, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which leads to sleeping the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to sleep me,” but “I want my pain to be relieved.”
The realization of this report was possible thanks to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Large real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road construction office, companies of the main construction industry, money raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, unionists and mafioso are entangled.
A "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system is breaking down since drastic measures have been taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, MEP in Quebec and former Montreal police chief.
The scandal was uncovered by him due to an in-depth investigation of the insults related to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he emphasizes, “the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars on the contracts,” because some were restraining their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already set down two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will be able to "show the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
Established in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit is also making great efforts with its troops to the government’s auditors, investigators and analysts.
Moreover, the police officers of the "Marteau troop", which since 2009 has made the Montreal "Canalization Cartel" more restrained in the artificial inflation of the contracts.
In recent weeks, she has conducted rows of house searches and raised charges for fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving lubricants in exchange for public procurement.
Explicitly charged were engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has aroused upset by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for receiving public procurement.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had his hand everywhere in the 2000s by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the Liberals at the time in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprisant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in the amount of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, whose costs he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they were allowed to be lubricated by artificially inflating the bills with false additional benefits by 30-40%.
Furthermore, an organizer of the Mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget filling his cashiers with black money.
As a result of these disclosures, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first deputies to hit an alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the eastern part of the island, she opposed the sale of a municipal estate from 2010, which was acquired for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation that is ultimately undertaken, she says that she "pulls on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the ants-immigrated system in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty."
She says the procedure is “painful but positive.”
We are about to clean up the wound, but we would need an investigative unit dedicated only to Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent a return to questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "mandators who are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a 70% share of black money in the funding of Quebec’s election campaigns, he jokes: “I was told that this was just a weak scratch of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which it says would not change the situation: “As long as campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics.”
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the procurement of public procurement and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this history damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about taking a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you have taken a new level with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress on their side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my game level every day.
And with a game, this is even easier.
In football everything goes very quickly.
But I'm not breaking out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed gradually.
They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new admissions this summer are used to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer his forehead and wants to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti respects all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he put in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the place of top rider.
We are in the ambush.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the eighth-finals in this way.
What is the aim of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak our words against very good European teams.
First, we want to be the first of our group ahead of Porto, so that we can play the back game of the eighth-final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
In order to become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means to ensure that this project takes on concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 as it was last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we are really interested in rejecting this title.
Last season we were close.
We were disappointed in May because we were strong enough to win.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Usually, you should be a champion with 79 points.
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right year.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much of the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept this.
However, if we win in a home match against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something to blame us, that’s certainly somewhat frustrating.
You wonder what people are expecting.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have shown strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that hasn’t been able to qualify for the eighth-finals for two seasons, and has also made huge expenses!
In terms of the sums invested, you were believed to play a break with 15 points ahead!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s achievements.
So much better that we speak of a "Zlatan addiction."
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many goals.
That’s why he came and proves that he’s the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
I was interested in taking part in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from pulling out some game time.
I’ve seen things that I’ve come out of stronger.
Today I am able to play good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since I was baptized with the Blues.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teaching, and today we have to unveil an exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and encourages victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had reached his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is this forced draw in Spain on October 16 (1:1) a starting game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a match like that in my career.
Bitcoin makes it possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows for direct file exchange.
With 15,000 computers on the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or payment method.
After the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, it fell to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “in competition with the dollar or euro” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as “credits” that are used to advance in a video game that can be won or purchased by gambling (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously invoice depositaries, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the trading bitcoins are present in the invoice book of public accounts distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, which is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege to add that additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked out".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (a lot of zeroes at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for cheating very quickly twice (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other remains unlinked, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task will receive 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly cut in half, probably before the end of 2012.
Bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to one hundred millionth, which leaves a certain margin of play...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had heights and lows.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company to pay for real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Prominent actors like Wikipedia deny donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book of bills and showed that nearly 80% of Bitcoins are out of circulation.
In November, a “mega-closure sale” was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify an address that can be "photographed and detected" by a phone, Pierre Noizat says, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are revised in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to pass, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB intends in its report to reassess the various risks, today highly regarded, in the event that this currency succeeds.
We have withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake possession of its territory and the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have especially punished Afghan peasants by regarding them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and wounded.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of peasants who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet times.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajikistans have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed with French loans, was done properly.
The truck and tank convoys overflighted by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
At the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban inflows into Kabul.
Since its irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At the time, Kabul was empty and the country was covered by war due to the fighting of the various rebel groups.
Their assumption of power was then seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmakers by seizing government land to sell it as a construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus taking advantage of the massive American award of subcontracts.
They put themselves in disgrace, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who were able to make use of the American grants: the escape of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In towns, state schools are full of girls and boys.
Those young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series depicting a modern world is watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Will the authorities under whose command it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already endeavouring to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from a certain decentralization from the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional storage units are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
Priority is given to private initiatives.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan possesses immense mineral resources.
This further reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on the spot to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to do their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s main employers.
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan to restore normal relations, which are largely dependent on imports and exports.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and boys gymnasiums, Institute of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and actions for the rehabilitation of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to achieve the "winning hearts and spirits" and the impossible task of combining of aids and open actions.
These works, for which numerous local workers were required, have helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural land use.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much lower budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very harsh in these valleys at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which is their own desire, the continuation would be less, more well controlled and would require civilian assistance directly affecting them in their favor.
A constitution with the breaking bar in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever divided in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it the unlimited authority, he has decided to put everything on a single map.
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly will adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted two additional months to this plenary for the completion of his work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on a preliminary text, which has been modified several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal mess.
This new initiative has only resulted in an even stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "the right steps down."
On the side of his supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to renounce their plan to explain to the Egyptians the text section by section.
For the president, it is also a way to recover his public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is raging across the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly magazine Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people with this resort to a hasty vote are given an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain the unlimited authority", the latter should supposedly end after adopting the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals failed to comply with the call.
Shortly before the Declaration of the Constitution in mid-November, they turned away because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve decision-making, 11 people, deputy members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining, by the way, that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed at the time for prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum of the constituent assembly was not exact.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made more strict application possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
“Spotty” replies to the liberals who view this only as a propaganda attack.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They have in particular in mind Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of conformity with the laws of the Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, as "the people who are asked to make an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also nurtured by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the present one.
“There is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, who have been partly trained in the French system,” says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, "that there may be ambiguity with respect to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Ann. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide about it.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticized because of the extensive powers it grants the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of dispute is the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military’s wish, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to parliament, but to a national defence council.
Likewise, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have called for.
The latter also express their concerns about the text that they regard as a threat to freedom.
The fact of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now forbidden, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Furthermore, no longer any article relates to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of sole
The Promised Land combines in itself the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons to visit Israel.
Bow down to the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river will receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding party, the walking on the water, the silence of the sea storm and the fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries are found in Jerusalem.
Here, believers take the path of suffering or cross path of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path starts from the Roman fortress Antonia, the pretorium where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, in Christian view, is the umbilical of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place of the Jews - the Cry Wall, the remains of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave there letters with desires, which then come true.
Make a journey to the height
The ruins of the Massada Fortress form the remains of the secret hideout from enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 AD for his family.
They lie on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins by their own power.
Everyone else brings an air cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters high is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, allegedly pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On one trip, not all can be visited.
However, at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are preserved ancient Qumra handwriting or Dead Sea scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean Desert, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the impressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and Badeans.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum guide nor souvenir shops.
Entrance is free, and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the most shaking chapters in history.
The most striking department is the monument to the children, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died sounded.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing Something for Health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinaries and oceanaries.
Astonishingly, the Red Sea bathes during winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathes there all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus carries even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt sole) and healing sludge, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm impaired nerves.
Touch the secrets of ancient times
These secrets hold the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city passed the famous seaway that linked Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah built his ark here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after the zodiac signs.
Fortuna is said to be the legend according to all holds that touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are performed today.
Bookmarks for tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money on the trip is preferred not in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily converted to shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you will mostly get ahead by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway train and in Haifa the only subway line in the country with six stops that connects the lower city with the upper city.
Actually, it is an underground cable car.
A ride within the city costs 6 shekels, irrespective of the means of transport, which is enough including transfers for a ride of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
From Friday evening until Sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
On Sunday morning, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and food that contains both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes with sheep and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus pasta, various sauces, fried balls made from puree beans and peas (falafele), as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this, there are many well-noutrished cats who roam the streets comfortably and unpleasantly.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the rooftops of parking cars.
Cats like lively places and don’t say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost on average 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreational seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the Promised Land, equivalent to a 51% increase compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MPs and civil rights defenders discuss the benefits of the binding language testing law for migrants, criminals are already trading with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families remaining at home.
On December 1, a law entered into force that requires every labor migrant to take a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing sector and in the retail sector.
However, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests will become a duty for all host workers in the future.
Not only language tests, but also tests must be placed in Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be proven for both obtaining and extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is official language.
This Act also exempts persons who received their certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The entirety of the examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of Peoples’ Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can test in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centers have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, civil rights activists asked the press several times before the law came into force: What does this bring about?
What changes brings the requirement to demonstrate language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, spokespersons for the Migration Authority say, it is about reducing the number of forced workers.
“Many are now talking about protecting the rights of labour migrants,” says Viktor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, your rights must be protected before departure.
Only organized recruitment will 90% solve the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without work, education, language skills and medical assessment face problems.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who will put him in a dark, narrow barrack under the pretext of help, where he will endure with dozens of his like months without food and documents and will work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland you will be promised the One, and upon arrival you will be cheated, their passports will be taken away and will not receive the promised salary," confirms the head of the Chief Executive Office for Labour Migration of the Tajikistan Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't reproach, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to make their money in Russia, admit that they not only do not master the language of the target country, but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford reasonable basic education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school items.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
“It’s hard without language skills,” they admit.
“You feel humiliated and inferior.”
Citizens' rights emphasize the following important aspect regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status must take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no exam and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the host workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Access prohibited for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic barriers and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
Also, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for a thousand and a half.
The officials of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and this results in cases of blackmail.
“They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,” the Tajik Umed Husjkadanov told reporters.
“Do not spare the cost of false papers.”
Even on the day the law entered into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be counterfeit.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed using an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests so paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a labor migrant three thousand rubles.
The main immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be simply purchased, both officials and civil rights defenders agree.
For the time being, the authorities can only promise to take a language course for guest workers who fall through the test for the first time.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal weapons market
The share of legal weapons in crimes is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten the weapons law for private weapons owners.
The authorities respond to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the attack on Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov.
Police intend to ban the use of non-deadly weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has been supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Counter-Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted soon to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to tackle the problems by "attracting the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various weapons associations - are calling on the authorities to refrain from "senseless sharpening".
The percentage of the crimes with registered weapons is very small, the criminal attorney, Vasiliy Lesnikov, told the Russian BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior’s statistics, 142 crimes with the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were committed for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law on private gun owners will not stop criminals from using the black market.
Currently, according to the authors, you can find any weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons enter the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, tells a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the Staff.
Screenshot of a website accepting gun orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
The second channel includes illegal weapons stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons warehouses.
In many military camps there were often explosions.
“There is evidence that in some cases it was a fire foundation to cover up the lack of weapons,” the former military official said.
According to Baranez, weapon manufacturers also make a contribution to the black market.
"Now there are countless private arms factories that do not withstand international competition and that is why they are dumping weapons on the black market, such as in Moscow," the expert said.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is its own, sometimes artisanal production, as well as a mafia that organizes smuggling,” the former military official explains.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated how much of each of the five channels has in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on arms portals.
The majority of the illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
"Half of all weapons on the black market are because of the guilt of those responsible who have to do with weapons in their work," the report said.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% from weapons theft, and 5% from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor to a weapons shop, who does not want to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been purchased because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for merchants to get the supplies in an arms warehouse.
A weapon, for example a TT type gun, is purchased through a flagship.
The gun is exhibited and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
“The police are of course aware of everything and therefore, if they can’t comply with the plan to detect crime, they regularly carry out check purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons,” the sales advisor added.
"Like in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers most often find acquaintances with each other.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested coming to the station "Begowaja", where a person would be waiting for me to take me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the gun there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to get a gun, I need a acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go there and date yourself with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, which indicates that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I’m even coming to some rings about a acquaintance I trust.
He also gives me the beat rings only because he knows I don't pick him up.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranez attempted to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this topic.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He received a photo album in which "everything" was depicted.
"I felt like I was in a luxury shop," the military official recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, but I drive to the forest with the seller, and there we set a target.
"Then I can shoot there, and when I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
There is no need for papers or personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "buy a fighting gun or rifle".
There users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without license," user asks "Ivan" (literally quoted).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic request from "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has recently switched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are going up to the service.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and allow coal to scrape
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible persons accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"As an answer, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end you can also go out empty and get behind grids if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service has recently switched countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are going up to the service.
"People come like hungry fish to feed and then land in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to scrape coal," he says.
A Makarov for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices are expected to range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons warehouses by mid-range supervisors.
According to the Ministry of the Interior’s official statistics, the number of offences with illegal weapons across Russia decreased by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
U.S. fast food and supermarket workers strike
One in four U.S. teenagers sit behind Mc Donald's cashier at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart branches and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell further or whether they will soon go out of the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast food employees, the protest organizers pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly trade unionized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, which took place in the U.S. sales that attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to handshakes.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, stamped out branches of the chain, whose target groups are people with low and middle income.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
Prices and the range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply only because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about harsh working conditions, such as lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests called for wage increases and expressed angry that the contribution to the owned health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 per hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley show that if the company increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1 percent more than they donate for wages now.
If Walmart fully transferred the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, this would be more than $12.39 a year compared to today’s spending.
Advocates of Walmart are satisfied that protests occurred in only nine states and did not cause any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in its store from 8 a.m. on Thursday evening to midnight the next day, and during that period, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Walmart’s cash registers completed nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the Huffington Post website that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees deposed the work and the protest action was merely “another PR trick” by the union that organized the protests.
"Free checkout!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target were not Walmart stores (which were not desired in this advanced city and therefore so far non-existent) but McDonald’s and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 per hour.
No one deserves less than it in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all U.S. teenagers after school stood behind the counter at McDonald's, but the teenagers were still living with their parents.
Few saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly encounter people who complain that they have to get along with this pay and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6.30 a.m. Thursday in front of McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits corporate management from stopping this goal and cautioning or dismissing trade union members.
On the other hand, business management doesn’t make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff fluctuation.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting in front of McDonald’s at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, “McDonald’s says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don’t get sick days, and you won’t be paid for your honest work!”
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should jointly support fast food staff so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!”
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on the spot, of which by far not all are employed in the fast food industry where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet to be seen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
“The brain can only be moderately overlooked so far.”
The topic of extended reality, popular with fans of modern technologies, is usually perceived lately by the lens of a special glasses.
Google first presented a working model at its annual conference in summer, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had applied for a corresponding patent.
In a conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the glasses were only a transitional station for the company’s scientists.
It stimulates the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group is conducting.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to anticipate 5-10 years and the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a progress, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, working on real three-dimensional representation systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more graspable.
For this, however, it is necessary that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but isn’t it overrated?
- It is certainly not the universal solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone around you about your actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its specific niche.
For example, in the field of object control in public places, we worked on a project where we experimented with short and narrow rather than unloading gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically it could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future, however, belongs to mixed control types, for example, gestures and language.
- How about that?
- We'd ask you, for example, to give me that bubble box?
They say it and point to it at the same time.
- Normally I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and doesn't afford at any time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about mutual approach.
I think that in the coming time we will have to work mainly on the development of new sensor types that enable us to capture people’s reactions more accurately.
This can be laser sensors, for example, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is it lacking resolution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It is necessary to consider not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and openly speaking, the present 30 fps are too little for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor at our Redmond laboratory with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
For my work, I needed just that device, but without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or exacerbate the problem because more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera inclinations to see how that helps us determine a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember right, unlike Google, Microsoft did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of technology of extended reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always have a smartphone in the raised hand on the go, but I think this is the best variant would be a "changing" extended reality where we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and therein lies their strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time also their weakness, because an extended reality using glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: there is no sensitive reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all.
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak of the fact that extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could definitely be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She perceives pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving the "images in the air" something hand-held, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound rays at a certain point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is currently as weak as if someone pushed over the handballs.
There are also ribbons for the wrist that act on the nerve ends in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Did you try to overlook the brain?
Does it make it feel what it should feel when it sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space think he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with running ribbons (other than in gyms), moving platforms as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only be moderately overlooked, and there are still many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avantgarde", dedicated to city residents who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
On the selected list already landed high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the city’s boundaries and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bearded man, whom you meet at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or on vernissages.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists creating new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street he makes a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and ensures good mood with them.
Recently, he grabbed a shooting organ and became a Petersburg shooting organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, dealing with the look and image.
In this world, Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, everything that deviates somewhat from the enormous causes aggression and bad behaviour.
But I want to get into conversation with people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you needed to become a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Culture Palace, where my works were exhibited.
I understood that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevschina"; from which "Pushkinskaya 10" emerged, and then it was finished.
It draws me to theatre, to fashion, to music, actually to everything except literature.
It was important for me to be at the center of the Petersburg culture where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there until the renovation works, there was a musical and artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemians.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Cord came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to playback, wore tight jerseys and included today’s trendy composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became their "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Dressberg, and it started his great career, but the basics he learned from us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the Art Clinic.
That’s where our employees and regular guests went.
I am a hero of the last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I reached the peak.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Nowadays it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares to be like that.
In a clown, it blurs everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by demanding that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everybody pay attention to clothing and orientates themselves on the outside, not on the inside of man.
But perhaps you should not give a person your hand, but spit in his face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban film player, a cultural town should have such a hero.
Who if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art needs to be careful, thoughtful and flattery.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, the people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 bill that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you'll like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- To Stas Michailov's performances come several thousands!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons there are 300 people, not 10 thousand, therefore there is less management, money, and everything is perishing.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings, which at a collector even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that’s something quite different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's lacking in Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Servants of culture.
But not everyone can deal with culture.
With the real tsars it was different, because the tsars might not understand much of culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are good advisors in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have some that could be experts, but they are blocked from the way, as they need higher-level experts who will assess the first and open up the way for them.
Now only his own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters need to look for other museums.
- What's with you, Petersburg?
-Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
Art can grow hard on our stones.
We need a cultural soil, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that’s not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people visiting exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with Killerasteroid.
Caravanes of spaceships with inhabitants on board are heading for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question arises, how can we reproduce in gravitylessness or on the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are not many choices.
De facto, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientist at the Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at large heights or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first discussed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Already half a century earlier, experiments with plants were conducted.
The fourth generation of peas breeded in orbit did not differ at all from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, guards were sent into space to explore the effects of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
A normal chick is developing.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick must find a stop; it must be able to stand on his legs and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychev.
Without a solid ground, the chicks struck wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn completely diminished.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Two times we let chicks slip and then set it up because it is simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev for the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already sent into space fertilized.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had a young offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals who are ripped out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could do so in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our pigeons flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"In the end, no one answered this question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even performed work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts who after long flights all went well and got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights in orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Walery Poljakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must look for new pathways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolaboratory in the Cosmonauts Preparation Centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here, in a floating state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
Water represents gravitylessness.
Even though adults feel water as pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders testify that life on land has escaped from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child is in the mother’s belly for about 9 months in amniotic water, and the fact that it is then easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swimming only last 2 weeks.
“It’s too little time to forget something,” says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenova.
While for a newborn child, therefore, the loss of gravity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not go without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles retreat enormously quickly and thus also decreases the ability to press out the child.
All right, let's bypass this with birth-initiating tools.
For example, birth could also take place in a special chamber to press out the child.
"But what happens then?" is the non-significant question of Waleri Poljakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the attraction of the ground, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be placed in a stress suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of elemental importance to his life.
“This experiment, which we do together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled, a completely unsuitable person,” says Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission at the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is mere theory.
But at some point it becomes reality when the Earth's inhabitants depart on their spaceships to a distant planet that will become the home for their descendants born in space.
NKÚ Chief: Black system control fails due to political fault
The Czech Republic has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws in relation to public procurement, but falls back in its application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), said this.
“A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied correctly – and I think that is not the case with us,” Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result seems to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he introduces the position of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now forbidden or allowed?
“A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the president of the government, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, can hinder its activity,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the control committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project, which compared the laws of the two countries regarding public procurement.
What was it about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel examination that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question of the European legislature setting out how public procurement is to be handled. This is what national legislation builds on. Finally, there is still the actual practical application.
We compared all this to each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we were able to notice extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a little "stronger and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again and again, and we must also consider the actual application of the law.
How can the project be helpful to you? What does this project mean to you?
It is precisely such a common control that could help us to stop constantly endeavouring to perfect the laws and to lower and extinguish thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicality means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it’s even like that we’re only loading the system with excessive “paperwork” in this way, and those looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NKÚ of the Bundesrechnungshof, which has a similar structure as we have and also has a college that is merely formed slightly differently, but in principle both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, although Germany is a federal state, that is to say that these courts of accounts also exist in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the State Accounting Courts.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
However, in some respects, Germany is often referred to as a model, but it is certainly impossible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Perhaps this is because the auditors are better?
It certainly doesn’t, but as I said, I don’t particularly like comparisons like that.
In this regard, it should be noted that those countries which are an example for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have any cooperation with our authority, wouldn't you?
As regards Czech legislation, what importance had the amendment of the procurement law for your authority, do you already feel any effects?
Given that this novel is only in force for a short time, it has not yet affected our trials.
As our checks take place afterwards, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we are more likely to experience effects in the preparation phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control tool "Detection of risks of inefficiency" and reviewed and analyzed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will of course have an impact, as thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or is the system being burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "strengthened" and can no longer be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, the persons undergoing an audit are liable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational regional policy programme, the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the procurement law is equal to a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to make the law even more strict?
I don't think that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, not punish those who have made a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First of all, let’s say which path is not adequate.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system forbidden or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the head of government, and the control office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, can hinder its activity.
He can say, "We're changing the law and allowing the thing," but he can't say we're pretending to be nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and that is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely because of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think is missing from us.
On the roads there is some ice smoothness, but they are predominantly dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is some snow and ice smoothness.
Most of the roads, however, are well driveable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were easy to travel this morning, and sometimes snow and ice were smooth.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, it should be a little warmer during the day.
In the region it is no longer snowing, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
However, on the combs of the Erzgebirge there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district street guard, there was limited sight due to fog.
The highway R6 and the first-class roadways in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is required, for example, on bridges on which the roadways are sometimes smooth and smooth.
All second- and third-class road traffic routes, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, snow remains on these roads in some parts.
Increased attention is therefore required especially in the higher layers.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger due to ice smoothness, in higher positions and in the mountains there is sometimes still a stretched snow layer on the roads, the road and motorway direction informs on their websites.
The road masters warn drivers of ice smoothness, which can occur especially in higher locations in the Pardubice district.
Ice-smoothing can be seen in particular on traffic paths of the second and third class in the circles of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Hory Mountains.
A stretched snow layer lies in altitudes on the streets of the circles of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia today it is predominantly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely rainless.
The temperatures range from -3 to +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen (district)
The roads in the district of Pilsen are well driveable today, but local attention is given, and the driving style is to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it had snowed before and the temperatures subsequently dropped, ice can smooth on the roads.
Furthermore, fog can be expected locally, but the view will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road masters.
The D5 motorway is practically fully accessible, but higher attention is recommended by the street masters between the 80th and the 131st kilometre.
The roadways of the first class are predominantly dry but frozen.
However, in the south of the circles of Pilsen and Tachov, ice can be smooth in some parts.
The roadways of the second and third class of roads are wet, and therefore the reference to possible cross-sections also applies here.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc (district)
Today, drivers who are traveling towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district have to count on snowmatch.
After the use of scattering vehicles, snowmatch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snow driving forced the street masters to use, in the district of Šumperk, according to the road administration, about 3 cm of new snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually fully accessible.
"In the circle of Šumperk there are still snow remains in the altitudes.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect snowfall towards Jeseník," a road administration employee of Šumperk told the agency ČTK today.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to go out at night, according to her data, the roads are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the district of Olomouc, the roads are fully accessible, but in the district of Šternberk, drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the street masters report several poorly accessible road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smoothness, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the district of Ústí n.K. is blocked according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain in lower positions below zero, so that snow and ice will keep on the roads, but from the deep plains, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, there are no problems reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice smoothness is reported in particular from the periphery of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Poor traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from the road I/13 on the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The blocking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches pressed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people like to jump to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more likely to make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce our readers to the project?
It is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, whose end is predicted for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
Three concerts will be held at the same time in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00 a.m. on the day before, i.e. on 20 December.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours ahead of us.
Who did this idea come from?
Initially, I was sure, afterwards we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will once hand this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and keychains against the end of the world, with their purchase through www.e-tap.cz, people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world, entitled "The end of the world falls out".
Even today, the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also sound on the charity concerts?
Of course, and quite at the end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn will be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live in a direct channel on Czech television.
The text of the anthem is from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to work with the two?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we hold many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to engage these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What is the benefit of the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible education center Studeo, where we already work for six years with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
Students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by readers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the readers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we will build our own building, into which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
According to what criteria did you choose them?
We wanted to build a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere perform with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “big events” planned for the future?
In May, we perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the US - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not very small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage storage room. In addition, of course, we must carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that sometimes I have already partly wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you can compare how accessibility looks in individual countries, how to deal with people with disabilities, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we do, we were witnesses in Russia that everything is still in the east.
Moscow is absolutely not suitable for disabled people in front of Prague, where it is still unusual if someone is traveling in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even obvious that a wheelchair user is allowed, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also clubs that are trying to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're hanging behind...
However, it should be noted that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of the affected persons.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not quite usual that there a larger group of people with disabilities are actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly willing personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years: What motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in engaging with something intensely.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, I founded a music-AG with a colleague.
Well, and with time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, is usually saying, something is out of control (laughs).
But the band has only been known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started actively advertising for ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and you cannot see it from the outside, your own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was your goal to get it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that things could be dealt with differently.
In show business today, one copies one another.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are few really unique things, and I dare to say that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the spectator has most is of course compassion; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
It is people who can live and develop a full-fledged life, provided they have the necessary resources to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeeds, this is a progress not only for them themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not make compromises in many things and also require some discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have a rehearsal twice a week, have to complete preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm of many quickly disappears.
But this is how it works everywhere, in any band that seriously works and wants to achieve something.
Currently The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't prevent that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place on the day before the predicted world ending, Thursday, 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
Locations are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected via live circuit and there is a common interpretation of the anthem "The World Falls Out" by the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the equipment of a multifunctional educational centre for disabled people, which will be established under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
Admission costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years of age free of charge, tickets are available on pre-sale at Bohemia ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, making it the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space started much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were involved in space travel, but they did not always encounter understanding.
I recall here, for example, A. Šternfeld's lecture of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author introduced thoughts from his pioneering work "Entry to the Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch for "Entry to the Cosmonautics" donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and spacecraft.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-recognized contribution to the development of space was recognized, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the face-to-face side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for launching or braking the draisine.
The information for this purpose comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began dealing with rocket-powered shots.
The research was conducted by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents presented show that the research has progressed to the stage of practical testing.
The research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric hunting dragon from Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the press, and the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, his work was finished from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on spacecraft appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to spacecraft.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the establishment of a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was expected that the exploration of space would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish space company PTA endeavored to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and indeed the PTA became an ordinary member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been significantly involved in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests began in the Błędów Desert with the two-stage RM-2 missile.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of altitude winds.
In 1962, however, the further development was stopped.
As a successor to the first RM missiles, the Meteor-1 missile was developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage missile, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed from this rocket, which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A missile had a transport space with a capacity of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B with a capacity of 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C with a capacity of 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight height for all three types was 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second interkosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
Repealing the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on non-profit work.
This decision sparked a lively debate in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unrestrained financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages), there are price tensions.
This term means a condition in which the manufacturer attempts to persist in economic competition by importing favourable goods by "undercutting" competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their manufacturing abroad, buy them cheaply, or quit their business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparably high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure must necessarily rise.
This situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unhappy to pay their taxes and thereby replace the economic and social damage they cause.
This situation is generally known, so concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population to private capital without regard to the social consequences.
This is expressed in particular in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital, especially in the wage sector.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand by the circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is increasing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
For several years now, there have been public food distribution agencies in Germany for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state must increase their income to the minimum of subsistence.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of aid forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern states will undoubtedly run to the same state in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century) or for a hunger wage on the edge of society, hoping that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country.
Here, naturally, the question arises, where does this capital come from?
When it comes from another EU country, poverty only migrates from one country to another; or capital remains completely out, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, employees work for a fraction of the European wages at all.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media affirm that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital closely insists on its point of view that the state must not intervene steeringly in the economy.
But then one has to wonder whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent lobby and ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual preference, legislation in which practically everything is punishable but nothing is criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry, due to a lack of finance, commissions private legal entities closely intertwined with industry to prepare draft laws.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies are now rapidly entering into a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state had long been in disintegration, and the offices were occupied by violence.
Against lubricating money, by unlawful destruction of benefits or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew uninhibitedly, and the people went to the election with already bought votes" ... "People with character did not apply for offices, so the state had no permanent consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "It was really started to talk about that the only medicine in this serious situation was a solitary rule, and that a strong man was to be elected there...
As it turns out, today’s society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is already in its nature incapable of recognizing and enforcing the advantage for the whole society.
The result, today as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites who do not strive for deeper reforms at all.
The cause of the emergence of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's perspective, the decline of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause in which the next round is already taking place.
It is particularly catastrophic that today’s elites are completely ignorant of the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from older and recent history.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is system-related.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms, which increase the capital participation of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Labour of Chaos.
"... that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be any,” says the dying Good Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a myriad of reactions.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while calling the Palestinians terrorists; the others in turn supporting the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide on the Palestinian Arabs, and calling the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write about who in these recurring waves of killing is the guilty and who is the victim; ultimately, the current inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence themselves.
It’s about opening a look to readers behind the scenes, looking at whom the 95 years of tension (counting from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spots of the country in the Middle East are especially useful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and come out of my own understanding of who or which group of people influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less apparent is the question of whether it was really these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it has not arisen within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be called the head of the crack (I don’t know if anyone is above them, but I do not exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s to prevent the association of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which always stood the strengthening of their power, the multiplication of their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against countries where they are not involved in central banks, they are waging wars or preparing for them (before the raid on Afghanistan there were seven countries, after the raid on Iraq there were five countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only four remained, with Russia in the meantime subordinating its central bank to the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to oppose this family had to pay with their lives for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the world economic crisis in 1929.
The Rothschilds' global power cravings led in the years 1859-1871 to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, by the second war in particular the colonial rule of Britain was to be broken, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and their luxury and would not consume as many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism here is not to lead to absolute).
The method by which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the forefront is to trigger a crisis and subsequently offer a solution (order ab chao – order out of chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to the exacerbation of the situation (see founding of the Fed, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After the murder of the Habsburg throne successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo triggered the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Tsar Empire through the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsar empire the war was no longer necessary), subsequently the dissolution of the Central European great power Austria-Hungary.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the bankers created a latent conflict situation by means of politics, by occupying Germany with giant war repairs; thus they also created the prerequisite of poor masses, so that they had to subjugate the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, who named the culprits and offered simple solutions; a further factor was the creation of a multi-world.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as possible in the historic territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration created the prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke away from the chain at which the international bankers had held him initially, or whether everything went as planned, is difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will become a victim in the forefront line, this time together with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (think just how sharply people are divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with individual greed and their pursuit of global power at the beginning?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, as the international bankers in Israel as well as with us, the people, put exclusively their own candidates to the election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-prone, loyal to international bankers devoted politician who is doing everything possible to spark a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran’s membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly overtake a global conflict of only 20 percent, and in the event that it could overtake the world.
In 1994, David Rockefeller wrote: “The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order.”
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to submit this being to total control.
And it makes the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves, all to give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: whoever has understanding, let him consider the number of the beast.
For it is a number of a man, and its number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the patronage of his regime for decades.
For the US government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as it would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt to free the same oatmeal only worsened it.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The hostages’ fate at home provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo of director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the embassy was occupied, six ambassadors managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to conceal their true identity - they traveled disguised with Canadian passports as members of a film staff allegedly visiting the scenes in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of Genres
The plan developed by the "exfiltration" expert, Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the covering credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels change in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no great differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come from ironic and slightly overwhelmed.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, in the office halls, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after Crime No Child Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film not playing in the director's home Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that removed this director’s previous films from the standard of Hollywood.
However, Affleck also proves this sense in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place – the entry sequence of the ambassador’s insurgency is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability that happens when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck with his team even in fictional scenes (the false film rod on a basar in Tehran).
Too much plot in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in the filmic sense.
But with the few, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping reality somewhat - which then doesn't always look so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is avoided by a phone call in America, or even the persecution on the runway, look somewhat artistic).
The weakness of Argo is its too broad scattering, due to the need to have to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, so they are far from alone in the film.
As a result, Affleck’s film loses some of its tensile power. It is a film that can be followed with some interest and enjoy the design and the retro style that reminds us of a 70th-year-old thriller.
However, he awakens enthusiasm hard.
However, it is sufficient as a memory of a piece of history that is still alive in some ways, and as a proof of how overwhelming the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services are.
Guidelines for the inflation of balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnikovpoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to host the competition "Absurdest Regulation or Idea from the EU Workshop".
“The EU’s recent plan to introduce a 40% women’s rate in the management of large European companies led us to this idea,” Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organizing this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed a life insurance advantage because they represented a lower risk for insurance companies objectively.
“Another incredible insights from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, among other things, the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is consequently harmful to nature, and the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, as well as the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which became significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism also reaped in the past the factual prohibition of the use of the term "butter spray" or the prohibition of selling conventional bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more Member States (for example, Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself on the grounds that it would merely harmonize the unequal national standards that would hinder trade.
The rules on fruits and vegetables have already been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloons on sale, requires that children under the age of eight may not inflate the balloon without supervision of an adult.
The EU referred to an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of suffocation death in children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using year-market tortues.
There are curious insights at home, too.
It is also relatively absurd that a directive affects European officials themselves - anyone who takes on an official role in the EU may not use the term Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities the EU regulation on the scope of food stocks in the territory of a Member State.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food supplies that were allowed to be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for mushroom canned, for which a high fine was threatened.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving funding for applications for funding.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we don’t have a sea.
We will ask for reimbursement from the EU," said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the state warehouses were crowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic so far that it organized a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically funding for the establishment of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily becoming the target of criticism in the Member States, some experts believe that EU efforts to regulate and thus also to develop the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is rather the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also arouse the fact that Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, must fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and does not always win this struggle.
Although Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition goes back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugarcane distillate, not for products made from sugar beets.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck marzipan or the parma ham now also appear the Karlovy Vary Zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or also the Saazer Hops.
With a EU brand, the Pardubicer Lebkake or the Hořicer Rolls can boast.
“People want me to save the republic, but I’m just an amateur,” Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for the presidential office?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything worked in our country without problems, I wouldn’t run anywhere.
But I can’t watch the Republic be plundered for 20 years, thieves walk freely, while people are raised taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, I’m trying to propose a solution to change it.
And since I’m over 40, and I’m independent and partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the position of a senator or president.
In the Senate you managed to do it and then immediately set out on your way to the castle.
Do you not turn your voters back?
I have been telling myself all the time that I will start the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will run for the position of President if I am elected as Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument that allows me to realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a stronger mandate.
The difficulty, however, is not just that as a people, we reproach in the bar and in front of the television, but we overwhelm anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media who want to rob the honor of one, and who confuse the freedom of word with the freedom to lie.
For example, I was claimed to bribe journalists or to be a consultant for Jiří Paroubek.
Let’s talk about your visions.
The struggle for the castle has been initiated with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive declarations of assets over 20 million crowns.
To do this, you have to change the laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I worked for the guide to remain a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is small-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-partisan, I have a far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without drawer thinking and party dogma from any party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics more right or left?
From a Czech perspective, people seem to see me more left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is totally unimportant.
It is important for me to move forward.
It’s not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or the SDG, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
It dislikes you if someone calls you a populist.
But are you not confirming this by what you just said?
When you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And this is what you want to approach.
This can be called populism because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in parliament, you only have keywords.
In the long run, you don’t get far in politics.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will succeed in enforcing material and criminal liability, for example?
I don't have any other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them on our side to enforce these goals.
As president, it would not be a problem for me to call on the chairs of parliamentary parties live on television to enforce material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Those who have been spoken should tell them why they refuse to do so.
A strong personality pointing to abuses can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and I am trying to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it does not work, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I can’t achieve anything alone, so I have spoken to several well-known personalities about whether they wouldn’t like to run for the Senate.
I spoke to Radim Jančura, for example, but he refused because of work overload.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in light fuel oil trade.
I started my candidature with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of voters have not gone to the election at all, and those who have gone have mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district chiefs.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to review the past of every potential party member, and I don’t have the money for it at all.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only CZK 20,000.
You don't have money?
Are you talking about wealth statements, what would yours look like?
My private assets are estimated at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million. And then I have a few more millions on the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream – I always liked James Bond driving in the car, being galant to women and fighting evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and don’t have money for your campaign?
They say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t get too much interest.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign by my own means.
The costs of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn’t live from the senator’s salary alone; for example, I couldn’t finance my son’s English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn’t run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur in order to have your wages?
Didn’t you say that you’re going to turn those activities back?
But this is not related to the level of salary.
As promised, I have partially declined my activities.
In this way, for example, my deputy becomes the managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.
But I have to live from something too.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that’s still the case.
As President, however, I would quite cease my activities.
The full conversation can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not just in the mind - by the example of Spijkenisse and the recently erected Bücherberg - 2 Photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there’s something interesting to see again,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large company, says, "But, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes volunteer to any of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a hardly visited sleeping city outside the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants community has the lowest education rate in the entire Netherlands.
To counter this stupid circumstance, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general education and to rebuild the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as pretty brushed steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the town fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library must come!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of the bold bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual serenity and appeared for the competition hearing year 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile in the face.
And while the jury was still dumb looking around and shaking with the armpits, the ruthless Maas piled his elected consorts of magnitude to a pyramid and ended his actionistically-supported speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So that’s him, my proposal for the Bücherberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the €30 million mountain was split.
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, the faceless small town retreat, which to date had no more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunningly ugly town hall, behind whose white façades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: bookseldorado under a cheese bell.
While there is a lift that leads through the mountain massif, the true space and reading pleasures are unlocked by the foot climbing of the topography.
The round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned klinker floor and the elegant street lights unmistakably speak the language of a public city square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic room configuration upside down and slided the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is used skillfully: in the center are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special pleasure are the black book shelves, which are sometimes wall covering, sometimes padding, sometimes steering rails.
Optics, feelings and smells are strange.
Even incarnated architects and civil engineers shake their heads if the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a Friesland farm, we encountered a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimeter thin plastic nonwoven is used as a root base in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for the blocked waste.
For the library, the nonwoven was pressed to four centimeters thick plates - for the first time in these quantities.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, resistant material that smells like a new car and like a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500-metre hike you will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They ensure the atmosphere, but above all the proper humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
“You wouldn’t believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a leading project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass collapse, the sun even on sunny days shines only briefly inside.
The wide wooden limb bars, which stand across the glass facade, serve as a shadow and capture much of the sun’s exposure.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest will be done fully automatically.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic from the IT industry, already dared the way into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there, too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg the Spijkenisses "soul that has been overdue".
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This will fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully equipped library - currently 70,000 pieces - for the time being.
The concept has risen.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation now every resident has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
In this way, MVRDV has succeeded in that royal discipline, which is called the "Identity Foundation" in the specialist jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literature history.
No matter how young and uninstructed she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans have to play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin balances this at a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
Then Berlin abstained.
- Why? - Yeah.
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote when it came to establishing a flight ban zone.
This was ultimately enforced by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just shifting its foreign policy away from a policy managed by the US, so to speak, to a German foreign policy.
It makes it more difficult for Europeans not to have a coherent and unified policy.
Thus, the Germans are reflected between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still touching on their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Foreign policy as they have France or the UK.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean from a German perspective?
It also shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance in the Middle East conflict and voting in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to hit the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a role.
But I wouldn’t like to put too much weight on it either, that’s not a totally unilateral relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions, such as the Palestinian vote?
I believe that there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
That is why I don’t think this was such a dramatic breakup as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect with this.
Because it signals that it is to be taken seriously as an international player and his interests to be taken into consideration.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there disagreements between the United States and many European nations?
Due to American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the administration under Obama secretly has quite a lot of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government of course cannot publicly represent this position.
I think the actual differences are not as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so excited about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead have to push things out of their own position.
This is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Sees Germany itself in the role of an important international player - does Germany want to take a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still having a heavy leadership role?
Germany is not yet accustomed to it, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, there are different anti-German feelings free every time Germany takes on a larger role.
That doesn’t make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptive to a variety of neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is continually decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else will stay there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's uncomfortable for them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a name which is officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection for as long as the actual namegivers do not complain.
Even then it is not clear if they are right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at law firm Taylor Wessing, who specializes in copyright violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes on my desk.
A few additional letters are enough for imitators to register their trademarks.
Thus, Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company there ordered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that was also used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese world champions in copying and injured intellectual property are known.
In the major cities there are multi-storey department stores that almost exclusively sell counterfeits.
Patthoch’s cases are different, however: on behalf of his clients, he proceeds against giving Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
This means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not conscious of guilt.
“It’s harmful to business, you have to fight it,” said Pattloch.
“The brand is being diluted, the solitary position disappears, the image damage is enormous.”
The financial failures and process costs of the sectors affected go to the millions, especially for expensive high-end products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury items and the fastest growing market with a volume of 15 billion euros a year.
However, erasures of doubtful entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years the procedure can be extended, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reported cases in which the court dismissed lawsuits because after the long duration of the contested name had become "market faithfulness".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist money for infringing his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also concern graphical elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese can still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing admits that there were shortages there in 2010 because of too little staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, we have returned to normal from the "emergency situation in the workflow".
Thus, the inventory of unprocessed opposition procedures decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 protests are still waiting for death.
Dealing with this costs a lot
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is leading the list of new applications worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the authority said.
This also applies to the inventory of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were charged.
Simply put, this means that each registration costs on average 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
To tackle this costs many times, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts was excavated.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This was missed because in Germany family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also rejected the opposition of Munich.
In the next two instances Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You have to be hell-careful
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident in bringing the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the dishes.
But he also says, “The procedure is extremely complicated and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs could hardly be calculated, the company archive had even had to check through 100-year-old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
“You can see how much that is worth us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers in the Far East are threatening to shift back to Europe.
Then, when imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to apply the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has long been abandoned by the Group, but it was still able to revoke the registration.
“You have to be careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in dealing with China.
It’s not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, foreigners should “register everything that is somehow worth protecting, also in China,” Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay the opposite side royalty fees for your own name, Wentzler explains.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir tries Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are pleased.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and men's slippers look for the clock on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - oppress, deceive and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his smoothly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is trying a new song.
Fifty singers, between the ages of 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the householder, have arrived.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help with self-help
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, estimated by UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland live 245000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa found sponsors in Germany.
Seventy of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child a school fee, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storytellers or praises on Zulu.
The Bantu language can speak fluently no one in this room, but sing.
For nearly ten years the choir has practiced songs in this soft foreign language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: in the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are killed by the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, what all of Swaziland is ill is shown: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying in the middle of thirty is not uncommon.
During a joint African trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him to eat a warm meal a day.
Yet a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since almost professionally taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and trippers (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies are among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main stakeholder groups?
Syphilis and trippers occur mostly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five syphilis cases reported in Germany will be transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonades, candidiasis (mushroom), trippers and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults here is relatively low – nevertheless: about 20 percent of new HIV infections account for this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections occur significantly more frequently than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, human papillomaviruses are also common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 diseases in 2001 to 3,698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a sexual illness?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because in part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed through lubricating infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations especially for frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed most STIs can be cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least the gags, which the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and powerful woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care of the orphans to accommodate well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have accommodated up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
Those who no longer have anyone come to the shelter at Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club just as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American health organization PSI that many in the village have done an HIV test.
This is not obvious, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, you prefer to quiet it dead.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute black monarch of Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
While there would be free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is different – flesh to flesh.”
To encourage cultural exchanges, the Imbongi Choir travels together every two or three years through the south of Africa singing songs full of grief, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many still know on the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much appreciation not only brings mood and joy, but has also destroyed some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their paternal children.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is the light,” the people there say.
And when you return the 8733 kilometres airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the rehearsal at Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the planet’s permanently shadow region.
It should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one can associate the finding of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, chief scientist of the messenger probe.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have entered other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earthly citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: Small eye holes in infinite spaces.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, circling behind Neptune around the Sun, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This section of an infrared image from the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are recognizable than blue dots, more difficult to identify the pink "newborn" in the Star Circle Hall.
This star-forming region – named unromanticly by scientists W5 – has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the star image Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling flare of a dying star captured NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star threw out during the death process.
In the enormous Trifid nebula, 5400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this photo of the Galactic birthplace.
The Pleiadic star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colours are better evident.
Like a red age, the helix fog looks at the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is 700 light-years away in the Aquarius star screen.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent brought this mist the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.

One of the biggest and sharpest images of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colour, shots of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Shooter.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, three-split), as dark dust strips three-part the burning heart of the star birthplace.
In the constellation Snake Carriers, astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race toward each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If there are no technical abbreviations, they may be called Southern Fire Wheel by their nickname.
The photograph of the Hubble space telescope shows an excerpt from the Iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The fog, 1400 light-years away, consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray shots of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy calls scientists UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The Stargate is always producing new youngsters.
Also, this star cloud, coupled with the rosette nebula, continuously produces new baby stars - 5000 light-years away from Earth.
In this brightly radiant galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was not found until shortly after the Big Bang, when predominantly hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our Insights into Space: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown larger - and the insights they deliver have grown deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into space equally above two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is fixed at its altitude angle - and therefore limited in its mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the altitude angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light collecting power.
This reaches – despite a comparatively small mirror diameter – that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to the space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, which makes all the honor of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is meant to be 42 meters - and to be put together from nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
Pictures are expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which still looks to the sky next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope will also be created on the Mauna Kea, with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be marvelled on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are delivered by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already delivered pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates have been identified since the mission began.
The image documents the latest preparations for the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be fired into space aboard an Ariane5 missile at the earliest in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the missions of the telescope is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that ice exists on the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messenger circles far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
For decades, radar arms have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
The Messenger probe, launched in 2004, the first to circle around Mercury, has now made the scientists certain.
Drink butter daily - and get 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysh Mountains is to be called wild romantic.
The minibus rolls over the curved road, passing by densely forested hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian people group of the Talyshes, of which little is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Azerbaijani and is very long-lasting.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town is protected by too violent architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the arrival from Azerbaijan’s capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours because the road is only one-lane.
The tremendous wealth that the land owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the things for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Festival in May - and next year we have a festival of the world's oldest people here," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum for Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyshes from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was born.
However, the controversial star of the museum is shepherd Shirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, in 1973 he died," explains Fatulayeva.
The man has been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he is said to have had a daughter.
So did Şirali Müslümov account for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the seniors in Central Asia.
“There are also strikingly many high-aged people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men living.”
However, due to the lack of documents, there was no scientific evidence of age, especially as there were no registers of persons.
Each day melted butter
The fact, however, is that the people of the region around Lerik often strikingly reach a biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why do so many old people live in the south?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyshs.
The museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is about diet.
But that precisely the high-calorie food of the talysses should be so healthy, that they love meat, bread and especially dairy products and of which many drink a glass of melted butter daily, does not seem plausible from a nutritional scientific point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel, which rolls her tirelessly up and down.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and one daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two toddlers also jump around.
In the kitchen guests can prepare tea, which is served in the typical belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth stand perfectly in row and limb, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never got out of me and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I haven’t bought food in the supermarket.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
It was worst after World War II.
But everything became better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the worship of the nation’s father-figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, later his son Ilham took over the rower.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s ancients.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions an amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s gray son has long been right: “The elders enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the midst of the large family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If this is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivaling protests in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as a basis is heavily controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly disputed in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of graces of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursi said, apologizing, he temporarily circumcised the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctoral degree from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are aware of, the world is not quite aware of.
Should the judiciary be eliminated?
In fact, the 234 articles that were whipped by the Islamist-dominated 100-member constitutional assembly in a 15-hour night-long parforce ride are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What do you mean "principles"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the legal margins associated with it for a more stringent interpretation of Sharia.
At least one new article suggests that in all matters concerning Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great radiation in all Sunni Islam, must be consulted.
This does not have to, but it can mean that the clergy supervise legislation, which would de facto result in the removal of the judiciary.
Much in the draft text is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress oppositionalists.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
The state should also, it is stated in the draft, "protect the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote their morals and values".
This is legally formulated so blurry that government institutions could even control the contents of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In plain terms, that means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article specifically sets out the equality of men and women.
For this, another forbids to offend or defame the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally doubtful is the wording that “insult to people” is forbidden.
Is there enough a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
Interpretation matter, as so much in the draft that Mursi is available for signature and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum.
“The revolution has returned”
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the Islamists’ superpower.
Tens of thousands gathered in unfamiliar agreement on Friday evening on Tahrir Square in Cairo and pledged to bring down the Charter even before it could come into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential election leader.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution belongs "on the trash mountain of history".
Through Twitter, he accused Mursi’s followers of pursuing a “putch against democracy.”
“If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not atoned yet,” Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blowed for counter-demonstration, but not for precaution on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile River in front of Cairo University.
Many disguised women and followers of the Salafists participated in it, shouting, “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They called for Mursi, "Clean the land!" and affirmed, "The Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir square, where everything began, would probably have invoked states like civil warfare.
Obviously, Mursi’s followers did not want to risk this.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now it is time to let the people at the electoral urn decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists are secure.
“The word human rights doesn’t even happen.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which should have gone until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights attorney and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned.
“And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution,” he complains in a conversation with the World on Sunday.
Mursi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state had the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto puts them out of force," Saeda said.
But without civil society organizations a democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which views the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most ill-odoring fish in the world?
Norway’s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living – not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the country’s secret to success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty fish?
A selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them amidst a pile of dirty, wet sports clothing.
And leave them there for a week.
So you have to imagine the nose-drugging smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-sprayed trout that is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly you would like to have your fish.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians stream to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very bribery specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk general".
People around us eat small fish cubes and eat large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can disrupt the smell.
I've tried a few cupcakes.
If you avoid getting the Rakfisk close to your nose, it’s not bad – like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities yet and fish was immersed in airtight salt water barrels in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after long fermentation and eaten - undoubtedly using alcohol-depressed senses.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and comprehensive healthcare.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not so long ago, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - an essential, but strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But in fact, here everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proudly 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t often get into the world press, and most people don’t seem to bother that.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it only refers to the "incident of July 22."
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of Norway has been one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes the round tray with mature Rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and stinging blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Your English is perfect, just like most people here.
We're not very enthusiastic, we don't like boasting.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully – a large part of the industry’s revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When in the years until the world economic crisis everyone threw money that they did not have at all, Norway kept its wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk," she adds with a laugh.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elk burger is definitely something else.
But in the evening the stinking fish is again on the dining schedule.
The hotel I stay in is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clotted showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict humidity of the whole fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
While Mexico’s future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his office, Will Grant from the BBC analyzes the challenges that are coming to him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor.
Even on better days, this is a constantly clogged city, but on Monday, a steel ring was built that closes several important traffic routes to the capital and causes chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to disrupt travellers on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bond and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the departing government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has proven itself economically well, but the country is facing a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Pena Nieto told President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to achieve this goal.
Before joining the U.S. President, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state, Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, the opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, people like to remember him.
The residents of the resort attribute him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement compared to the fragile, hollow roads that once existed here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We expect real and ongoing change from him,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, which is the PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party puts great expectations on Enrique Pena Nieto.
The opposition’s allegations, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are decisively urban in nature.
Earlier this year, the military was activated to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico – a statistic that even surpasses that of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for their violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not addressed the problem of women’s murders during his term of office.
In the worst case, however, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the fallen neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her companion.
“When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body was washed,” recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was already in place.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall, beside a cross that carries a single word: justice.
But this one, as the family says, has been denied so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I was a talker, a agitator, a neighbor.
They just want to accept their judgment and keep their mouths silent.
"But that's not possible if there were so many form errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidential binding on Saturday, he also takes on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take particular care of this issue during his term.
“I hope that as president he is the way he was as governor,” says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
The victims’ families in Ciudad Neza are most afraid of this.
Prosecutor says Bradley Manning didn't complain about ill-treatment
Attorney’s Office opposes Bradley Manning’s accusations of being abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense aims to reject the charge due to harsh conditions of detention
U.S. Army Freedman Accused of Stealing Thousands of Confidential Documents
The prosecutor's office on Friday tried to find that army-free Bradley Manning - charged with the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - missed several occasions to complain about his alleged mishandling in military detention.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that documents of weekly visits made by Manning's prison officials during his nine-month imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia did not contain any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a defense request to dismiss the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh imprisonment - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. Army’s intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had seated under reinforced detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fine surveyed him on Friday about the forms, Manning admitted that he had judged treatment by his guards as "excellent" and treatment by the facility as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, according to Fein, contained no complaints of abuse, although the officials had interviewed Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officials had discussed them with him and told him to deal with them, but they were not logged.
"They wrote (after discussing the concerns) 'No problems', and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicide thoughts he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his observational status for "injury prevention".
The military said it assigned him this restrictive status - which is one stage under the risk of suicide - to his own and the protection of others.
“I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and to get rid of the observational status for injury prevention ... to be able to achieve a higher quality of life in my view,” Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday he was arrested and relocated to Kuwait, where he was detained nearly two months before being relocated to the Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide in Kuwait and once became unconscious due to the heat.
Not to know what was going on with him or in the outside world has been a burden.
“My world shrinked on Camp Arafjon, on that cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell — at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours — and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or just lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that entered his cell from the outside.
If he turned around at night and guards couldn’t see his face, he was awakened to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning’s lawyer formally appealed against Manning’s treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked about an accusation he had raised in his statement Thursday - so he slept naked one night in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
At the interview on Friday, Manning said he had closed by order of his guard that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, trying to show an official that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the bundle of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention experiences and drastically reduce his degree of detention if he is convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has stated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offences, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend and the prosecutor’s office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was detained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all inmates detained under the highest security measures in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the favoring of the enemy, the unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transfer of national defense information, and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with life imprisonment.
The Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame emigrants - they remember hard times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when remorse became wide within me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of which to go.
I grew up in Central California and was called a Mexican for my whole life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Ire" or my friends in New York "Italy".
Later, I decided to be “Mexican American”.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shortcuts or bindings.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to stand in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I won’t get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the line for foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
The agenda included all the topics expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason Mexicans are now equally likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block in the model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue Mexico’s war on drug cartels, even though he did not give details about it.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans presumably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country’s leadership under a shotgun to leave more than half of their territory to them.
But for Mexicans thinking in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official has even the mildest criticism of Mexico, you can hear complaints - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - about how the Americans oppress the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the Montezumas children are on the war path.
And yet Mexico’s biggest challenge lies in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person — perhaps a parent or grandparent — did not have a chance to emigrate to Mexico and to the north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, untrained, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now have lived the American dream, attended good schools, and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of it as the American dream we are living, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class don’t like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have gone.
And then we wouldn’t see ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain now—with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this to them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel neither belong to the one nor to the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as a Mexican.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to resume their connections to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well, well.
That's not going to happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, unrestrained corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure if it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans are resentful of how their family members were treated just not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the germ.
Amid the usual accusations, countless buildings have been destroyed, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed – and for the first time rockets have been hit from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not – Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this mess.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly patt situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism does not seem appropriate in the light of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, the fighting this week has strengthened the hard-fighted on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, are claiming to have pushed back the Israelis, despite the fact that its group itself suffered great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip have been pierced in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a renewing, regional power once considered to be Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken up the Hamas party – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Rejoicing Hamas supporters believe that Israel is forming an Islamist half-moon – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist embossment might stand before the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt – by far the most inhabiting and most important Arab country – on the southern flank of Israel has changed the region’s balance sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the secularist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is married and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that even Israel and the United States cannot push out.
Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep quieter.
In diplomatic terms, the United States remains unwaveringly attached to its position. Many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers – not least thanks to the blockade systems that enter the West Bank and thus the main part of any Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared contrary to international law.
Netanyahu’s Likud party has partnered with an even more militant group in the run-up to the elections on January 22 under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these deceitful Palestinians beat them and leave them their own state?
If they really had control over the West Bank, wouldn’t they just like their fellow fighters in the Gaza Strip fire rockets?
No, it’s better to keep them behind the wall and punish them if they dare lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to stand up, but the Arab Spring could make them a tick through the bill.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense state is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments repair their economy.
The fact that pragmatic President Mursi worked together with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking scary steps towards democratization, Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a bowl of powder that will undoubtedly one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only exacerbate.
Bloody missions to push Hamas back in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The right answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel resigns for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give foreigners more influence in enforcing this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever before to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to encouraging Israel to negotiations.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he was equally inclined to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first laws on uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic pictures that show sick body parts and infants and children ill from cigarette smoke.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small fonts, will be on Saturday.
In this way, Australia is introducing the world’s strictest regulations on tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous picture of tobacco use.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not started smoking at age 26 will not start smoking at a 99% likelihood.
“You can see from young children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a slight impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favor the black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover unbearable packaging has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units in wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good deal.
According to experts, the popularity of social media is among the population to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banished tobacco companies from television advertising, prohibited them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most traders to no longer interpret cigarettes in stores. Now tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Those who market tobacco and have only a small area left to promote their products don’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen a rise in reviews of brands written by “very normal people.”
One has to ask oneself: Is this just a private person who finds such a favor of Marlboro cigarettes that they even make a video for it - or is it a marketing agency that has to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that rather than marketing, the industry focuses on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are conducting major trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
Meanwhile, these have been expanded to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore her.
“You just take a pinch and put the box away,” says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box that prints a photo with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, the operator of the tobacco shop “King of the Pack” in downtown Sydney, says uniform packaging made it difficult to replenish his shelves.
“I used to take an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four,” Yu says.
"The government should have completely banned cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing," he added.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored.
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts about boring.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts suggest boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thinking processes, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly staring at one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Oh, yeah.
And no.
I will come back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't think so.
“Truly, boredom has a very long story,” he says.
The house walls of Pompeii decorate a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and presenting the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom is the experience of wanting to perform a satisfactory activity but cannot be defined.
Boredom is therefore different from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
In apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, exists in a "disruption of the attention process, paired with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only slowly passing."
Boring can sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we are bored, even when we just have trouble focusing.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to a previous experiment in which participants listened to a band on which a person reads a magazine.
Some groups listened to a loud television show from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content; others listened to it at low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.
The people who listened to the hardly hearable television said they felt more boring than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, couldn't find any reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to the boring.
Trying to focus on a difficult or exhausting task can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when one performs a single-tone activity - "like searching for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not feel bored."
Indeed, he says, we now know that scratching and scratching, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically attentive.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a loud loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film.
Some people get bored easier than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale of boredom susceptibility" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements like “Many things I have to do repeat and are monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have enough time for everything.”
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are getting bored more often than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida – especially in terms of the need for more and a wider variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a fairly tense pile.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents with a pager seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of teenagers were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they were not at school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know if the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is felt particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boring healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity, which is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
“With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what to do best.
When one is bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you’re happy.
However, while television can create feelings of happiness in the short term, they are fleeing again in the long term.
So if you give your bored child an iPad, you can get it away from the boredom, but it hasn’t learned to entertain or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, "Self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to talk, but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even away from the constant activity and technology intrusion.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we need to be bored more often, but boring is the persistent desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth, people are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it’s hard to get busy when the noise is quiet.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law.
19-year-old community college student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands for a crime in southeastern Colorado that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few few marijuana slices and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavalry offences, each with a $100 fine - and received a court appointment.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for its own use, the response for hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of wrongdoing around marijuana are already dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
Police authorities no longer persecute adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent, which will be permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will continue tracking existing marijuana crimes and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so quickly that I don’t even know what will happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline in mind until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in any case ahead of most states in terms of regulation of marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited for guidance,” says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Spirits Supervisory Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent to follow,” he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also forms the endpoint of a gray zone where the state licensing system does not yet exist, but possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be clarified during this time – such as how to agree on the state’s requirement of “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his employees in Aurora stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana crimes in persons over the age of 21, and that the police would "from now on" not seek criminal charges for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce urban regulations to regulate medical marijuana growers and that drug traffickers will continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people must be held responsible for possessing about 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
“Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were crimes at the time of the crime,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are dubious even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the biggest city in the district, no longer display adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to abandon all pending ownership proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to agree on personal marijuana consumption with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state unveiled a profound division among local officials with regard to the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents defendants in court for marijuana offences and acts as spokespersons for the national marijuana reform organization.
“They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for not yet accepting legalization,” he said.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are acting as national pattern cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as a criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope the Justice Ministry will surrender.
Despite several eye-catching arrests by medical marijuana consumers and sellers, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy advisor to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal officials are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to refuse to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a town in the west, decided a six-month ban that is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We determine what the community has chosen, not what the state has chosen.
Many questions remain open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only today’s university students are being attacked for their views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university, which I once thought was the largest stamp of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again and thus brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I had gone because I had a problem with comrades having sex in the neighboring room.
The author A N Wilson declared that I had left university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I suffered systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason - one reason that seemed so narrow and cruel in this alleged cradle of enlightenment: my now-deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I was an advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate rights students is suffering similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week called for the same protection of equality that benefits gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked, and unwanted because of their political views."
They demand a place in their college’s equal rights committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was worsened by a recently broadcast documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," which portrayed Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It was shown, among other things, by graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and protected with silver-colored suit and silver-colored walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are regarded as “sin-goats for the introduction of higher tuition fees.”
20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
“People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without having met us at all.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student at Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president of the Oxford Conservative Student Association, says she has seen a growing rejection of JCR members to moderate right students.
“This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and the well-being of the members,” she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had voted in favor of not awarding Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have even scared Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students and the tutors got to know each other, I got a taste of what happened to come.
I experienced that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but even participated with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa have found their way into the wood-paved rooms of the tutorium.
At my first of these events, I was meant to translate French texts from the 18th century into English, and I had not been prepared for what would come.
“Ms. Wyatt,” tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased) said, “please translate the first paragraph.”
I stumbled on it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite reckless.
"Are Thatcher's supporters refusing to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students kicked.
In my eyes there were tears.
"I suggest that you take a few French lessons in your free time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt whispered to me.
I went back to my room with my head hanging.
That evening, I was sitting alone in college for dinner when someone tapped me on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is the way it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being a Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most Tory-first-semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
At a local pub I later tried to change myself.
I insisted that I didn’t agree on all points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
Ironically, a graduate in philosophy, politics and business, who had attended the conservative Eton College, said to me, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They hit each other, don't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after darkness?
Should I have to turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me stretched in front of my spiritual eye to a purgatory of restraint and isolation.
The only tutor to openly disclose himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-scale, and rejected it for his Marxist-deterministic history perspective.
In 1997 he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he told me.
I started hanging between Oxford and my parents’ house and found shelter with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said.
They would never do this, not in my city of dreaming tower tips.
Even my Communist friends always showed up perfect manner.
His wet eyes were clouded.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they're just kicking you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory adherent, had ceded to the pressure and abandoned his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, when another history teacher seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly ashamed, I admitted that my parents had undergone "brainwashing" and called them "old fool."
The relief only lasted for a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch Press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my cubs gave up.
As they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
I'd like you to call me a whirlwind tail.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer such intimidation and wickedness in an educational institution.
And even more tragic, it was Oxford - a university that not only brought about 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought to this day.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worth hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was recognized by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 Haute Couture clothes have been compiled, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the sticky and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photographs with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, starting with Princess Salimah Aga Khan, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino showcases these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
“At least they don’t make their tips on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friended with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the fashion maker’s charisma.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to him for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that started their career at the 1995 Haute Couture Week in Paris.
“He never goes out of fashion because his designs are artworks,” she concludes.
Fashion Show of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60 meter long walkway that suggests an exchange of roles: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the walkway to admire a dreamy "audience" wearing the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Kostóteles On.
In this audience of fashion dolls shine names such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria de Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Maker, 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty,” Feria said.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion leader Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to it.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that honors his name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino doesn’t depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg preserves her fashion maker's evening dresses "with absolute care," "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories."
The "King" of Fashion
The big final of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his seams) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a four-and-a-half-foot tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the specialist press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, “the return to the clients of the highest society.”
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now their best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, honored with the Honorary Legion, accumulated as many honors as each of his husbands.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his well-kept and perfect exterior," D'Arenberg admits.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
“He was flawless; time leaves no trace on him.”
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano carriers put their lives and health at risk by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur across the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their lives by picking up sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he must go down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas flowing from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the desired stone paths.
While it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb in turtle speed, keeping their balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened by a French tourist who crashed on the slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen’s mining workers earn 5 Eurocents for every kilogram of sulfur they mine.
Arriving upstairs, they bow the path between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 exploits the occurrences of the volcano and (never better) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for every kilogram of sulfur.
They then sell this for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) each to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matching woods, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Because we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each track it takes three hours, after which it has completed, but at the end of the day it then has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) combined.
What looks like a miserable wage for such an inhumane effort is, however, three times what he would earn from field work.
“The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid a day during the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high,” explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto with his family returned to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and that is for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought them to Islam to Java."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life at risk for Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left his first traces at him, despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I’m going to work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or hotel reception, but instead he does the work of a carry-on.
He divides a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o’clock because the sulfur also flows out at night, where his characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders at the crater bottom.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guards of this nature park demand along with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
“This work is for animals and not for humans,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old stem carrier who has been working for three decades since leaving school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as he can" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulphur burns the throat and itching the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners cling in the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious illnesses ... of course, except for the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that weigh from the crater.
With the basket on his back, Unainik at the age of 53 is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, transported by three trucks on a goat trail between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari at a distance of 18 kilometers.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder at the age of 30 also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty lasts generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as human burdens at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame for having no children on their careers, the stress and the cost of real estate and children’s education.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfill our citizenship duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of a mint candy advertising, but nevertheless – or precisely because of it – they became a viral video on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs such as "slide a "bao" into the furnace to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who shot the video, maintains the hope that the advertising will reach in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is just for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When reproducing, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it was a topic we had to take care of.
We knew the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromons or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possibly many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don’t we do something as creative as we can to address this problem, like composing a rap?
1.2 Children
The one who doesn’t take this issue easily is the Singapore government.
Every year, she spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to "better education" and "bigger career opportunities".
“This has enabled people to marry and form a family to have significantly more choices in terms of life goals and set priorities,” she explains.
These social changes have contributed to the higher number of singles and the delay of marriage and births, which results in a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a dramatic increase in immigration to counter the decrease in population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely hidden xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small houses are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is a concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they will discourage construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of real estate firm EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer directions to which previous obstacles were put in the way if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for a rise in national birth rates, talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will have no major impact.
“People are highly stressed, the homes and also the education are expensive, which is why it is being pushed out by many,” says a young manager.
The kids can get others.
“It’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women lead their careers, the stress, and the cost of ownership and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to having children - the government can do so much.
Offline Private Offline is online private
Privacy Policy
According to the dictionary, this is the private property or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for anyone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to your daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he makes public on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who are often travelling on the net.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very own" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
“My deepest secrets I wouldn’t announce in a post,” said 10-year-old Jorge while trying to explain the meaning of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world,” he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine or someone who makes the fool,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos of naked people, crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged in on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I’m just uploading them,” he adds.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk quickly to relatives remotely or friends,” he says.
When asked, he answered that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits to not knowing 20 of the people he has added to his friends list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, for example music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone is pressing me or asking them for me, I just remove them from my user account,” he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unknown to experiences known today as cyberbullying.
The friend of a girlfriend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
“He only made it private.”
After that, he explains a series of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I'm trying to wipe him out.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explained.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and youth, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
“The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, however, the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants", formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who should teach them when we still learn ourselves,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we demand from them that they have a defined criterion on what can be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is insufficient to do so."
“They should also be selective when it’s most important for them to be popular to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is to ask them questions that make them think.
“Tell them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then mentions a few ways: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to post a photo of you, like the one you posted by a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
Have you previously asked other people for permission if you labeled photos of celebrations?
Another question: Do you have to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to tell you that you need to act online as you do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational adviser, comments that it is indispensable for parents to carefully read the guidelines of the social networks.
If they understand all sections, they have a solid foundation to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
“For example, the age, or what you can share or publish,” he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers."
UNASUR Summit concluded without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was to be signed theoretically by the seven present rulers.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Meeting of the heads of state and government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially informed that they would hand it over after the closure, but then stated that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian government.
For questions about the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was restricted at any time.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists was received from the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document spread during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more information.
The presidential office of Peru then sent to the media an e-mail containing the "closing statement" of the summit, but it was the declaration of Humala and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit South America-Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a strong press call, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was not published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities emphasized that information systems were available for journalists, but they limited access to information to a great extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of the Hague that resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the trial that Lima initiated against Santiago to hear the pleas of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are presenting to this international court," Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and continues to be a country that complies with international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, reaches agreements and submits to international courts,” Piñera said.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, filed a lawsuit against the Bogotá Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its president Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, saying that 16 decisions have been made and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total investment of $17 billion have been set.
On the decisions taken, he said that the Unasur countries "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we will extend the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be advanced to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and against organized cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to low-price drugs and the internet in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the case of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant trains, but rather serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future,” Humala added.
“We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus unify our countries and open up new economic forms,” the Peruvian president said in a read statement.
Among these projects, there are five Peruvian projects on the cross-axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its re-establishment in the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighborhood relations was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit.
In that sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that he was expecting a meeting in Mexico on Saturday with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgment of the International Court questioned by Bogotá.
“I may meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow,” Santos said.
"We will review all these paths - they are not excluding, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the assumption of the country’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the action plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency on the time of the regional block.
“South America must learn about citizens’ integration,” says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, where “South America can actually learn something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told state television in Peru that the Europeans "killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts" and "are practically a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that would drive the member states of the Unasur.
“Free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the redesign of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return, we always sign the South Americans everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, referring to the political asylum Ecuador granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles but rather complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time "there were justified assumptions that Assange would be handed over to a third country and that his procedure would not be followed."
He also criticized Sweden’s court, which demanded him to be interrogated on his territory for alleged sexual offences, while “Swedish law permits this through a video conference that could have been carried out through Ecuador’s embassy in London.”
Correa explained that the danger would be that Assange’s health and mental condition would be impaired.
“Since he was in our embassy, I haven’t spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a mild problem with the lungs, but not a serious one,” he said.
However, there is a risk that he will take physical and mental harm because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
“It would affect the health of every person,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution for Assange’s asylum, which has been granted since June at Ecuador’s embassy in London, is the granting of a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there have been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeak.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not applying this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, conducts a series of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
And “If Britain grants this free letter tomorrow, I think it’s done.”
And if Sweden questioned Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype as Sweden’s jurisdiction allowed and in other cases done, the problem was resolved.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press, saying that what he does not tolerate is “the mediocrity, the evil intention, and the lie that undermines freedom of expression.”
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and blackmail for profit,” he said.
In that sense, he congratulated Ecuador on no longer being dominated by such journalists and not by bankers or hegemony and spie bourgeois countries, and anticipated that in a re-election, he will "deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in that right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain tough and must not accept any opportunism and no legally disguised coup" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian opponent, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which favored Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty to negotiate the maritime law between the two countries, "absolutely entitled."
Currently, this judgment is not being implemented.
This is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated extensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relyed on a good conclusion of disputes on the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that “it is right for Latin America to appeal to international instances if both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it is very difficult.”
Regarding the possibility that he can be nominated for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he said he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never personally interested me, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to take this responsibility,” he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as president, then I'll withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
“That’s decided,” he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of health problems of Venezuela’s President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned, routine treatment and that he was expected to be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean in any case a recurrence of President Chávez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death from AIDS is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the study: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis, which the doctor "tried to weaken" without any recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to learn about it; and this with such a commitment that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), to which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options, and more stigmas.
At the time, the director of a clinic at IMSS himself avoided saying goodbye, "because it led to a blind alley."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who don’t know about their illness and in whom the virus has already caused damage and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly equal," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG's HIV unit, saying that this information was published in April of this year by a prestigious scientific publication.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 the scientists have concluded that while AIDS is not a death sentence, that 500 years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the beginning of treatment, and that those who are not drug-dependent are more likely to have a CD of up to 50 years.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those who are diagnosed with HIV positive at the age of 25, in this sense, "can easily be 75 years old as long as they are under control," said the expert.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that Mexicans’ life expectancy is now an average of 76 years.
Even though mortality has declined significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has declined from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is nevertheless correct that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients have died in the national database.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that since 2005 there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs.
- So why are people still dying from it?
In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had any medication supply problems. The problem is that people are in a far-advanced state because they do not know their infectious state, that is, in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. To be able to influence global mortality, early diagnosis is required, which is why massive detection tests need to be offered to anyone who needs to do so."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco) and also the patients like Fabrizio, who had conducted his test in a private laboratory, even for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who had already been in the AIDS-Phase (despite his young age).
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to hear anything.
“If I have to die, I’d rather burst three times,” they say in my case.
The change was for improvement, I feed well, exercise and take the medications.
Nowadays, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio said, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today as part of the World AIDS Day.
The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms Behind the Store Table
There are large holes between the health programs and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken on the case of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
“The distribution of condoms was actually increased in places where they were previously delivered individually, now they are giving us packages of a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom,” he said.
Among the people at risk for new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you need it?" is a common mockery question from social workers, counselling staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the healthcare system who don't want to expose young people, the correspondent said.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the shop table, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
It is not to promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied to the question whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
“Sexuality doesn’t look like that; it’s best to bring condoms closer to those who already have sexual activity,” he pointed out.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
Nationally, the state ranks fourth in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and thirteenth in HIV.
92% of infections occur through sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people in each registered case who don’t know about it.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment that does not acknowledge the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent is created for every national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So it could be said that the procedures for survival of companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stars and stripes in contradiction with international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment delivered on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district of Texas causes Mexican companies to be helplessly exposed to seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens doors to Mexico’s largest glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, based in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are the trade bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency procedures for companies with cross-border profiles is not known.
Indeed, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created, with the American Law Institute as a arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment determines that without the votes of the companies having recognised the liabilities in the bankruptcy which the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been achieved for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among the group’s companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
Furthermore, it is correct that after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who sued against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier Funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
The vote was 45 percent to 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is guilty of its difficult situation as of 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which beat the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objected before the same Court of Appeal to the vote in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare appeal, which calls for review of the proceedings by a higher instance, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States, will be lodged.
The serious thing in this case is that the Court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure amicus curiae (Friend of the Court) describing the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Law on Trade Bankruptcy, and pointing out that the United States had strictly complied with the agreement signed by both countries in respect of Chapter 15 of the Law.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded caramboles: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican Air Traffic Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, came several months ahead, the Associación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores has finally made progress.
The petition referred to by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal proceeding against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accused of obstructing the judiciary.
After that, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the headquarters of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE to the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
This funding was used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting this weekend at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of bourgeois society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the Wall, complemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) has reached to unite the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental establishment, which partly destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has not complied with a Senate request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken despite the fact that the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it regarded them as a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without compromising short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings stock market certificates of over 500 million pesos.
The issuance is the first of four equal issuances that promise to pay interest every 28 days.
Establishment of Competitive
Composed of the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name Competitive, whose aim is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to more than $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world bummer, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been connected to basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a huge intellectual collection of the history of the country’s basketball as Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
Before he was tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexe was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, player of the first national league, authorized representative and head of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball federation.
"All my life I have put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, chief executive officer of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with his loyal wife Isabel for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and bear witness to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as a co-manager or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years that I enjoyed most because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967 as a managing director, co-managing director or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut at BSN.
From then on, Cuco took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager,” says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was hired at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, “I have a very powerful and 2 meters tall player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember when he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide for another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy on the national team.
I remember the first time we won the U.S. at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we took fourth place, what actually should have been bronze if it hadn’t been that Canadian referee who had us repeat the last round for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as was the one who won at the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the US team, as they did when they won against us at the World Cup bronze.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
A team that perhaps wasn’t the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the blocked players due to the occurrences at the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal contrary to any prediction.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as Piculín.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best you have achieved in the band?
I was part of the national team’s most successful era from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What have you left to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, the children do unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed trainings and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and sometimes I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played an unscrupulous, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
“Larry was back in his beloved birthplace in Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most,” the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and episode series, was with Hagman when he died at the hospital in Dallas, her publisher Jeffrey Lane said.
He gave joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived life to the fullest,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on television as a nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with NBC's "Beautiful Jeannie" sitcom.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Dzhinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also a performer of two comedies that were only broadcast for a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically well-rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting disgusting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The drama series of the CBS television channel about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who Shooted J.R.?", which was meant to create expectations for an episode of emotions where Hagmann's figure was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered at betting houses.
The series reached a spectator record at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who turned "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin, the brother-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot.
J.R. had pregnant her and threatened to depict her as a prostitute if she didn’t leave town, but others also had reasons to want him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a deceitful businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to introduce his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to be on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he hasn’t won.
Victoria Principal, co-actress of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as an “enormous personality on and off the screen.”
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshippers in the world and remains in our hearts for those who were fortunate to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast with great success on TV channel TNT a few months ago.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was complete, and a sixth chapter was just shot, the broadcaster informed.
There was no immediate explanation by Warner or TNT of how Hagmann’s loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical pieces such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the air force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he entitled his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t write anything that I thought could hurt someone or hurt him in any way,” the Associated Press said.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
“I advise them, give them courage, I will meet with them when their operations are coming and afterwards,” he explained in 1996.
I would like to give them some comfort, such as "don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course about the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long reverse count" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect him in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some referred to as the “Debtmaggedon,” as well as a growing conflict with Israel’s involvement, the place from which Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse is beginning.
"I didn't realize that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor to offer this semester, which is supposed to be the last in history, courses about the "end of the world."
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered leading to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
At the University of Pennsylvania’s main campus, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course called “The End of the World.”
“We don’t take up 2012 so we can always retain the option to reschedule the course in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "previous decline", students must study, create projects, and attend final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam takes place on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than to “continue to work until night, where the world is supposedly ending,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no places anymore," Restall said about his course for high-average students, which filled up with 35 students.
We received e-mails from students for weeks before the semester started, asking if there were still free places.
The students assure that the course is among the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology at Rutgers-Camden in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
Apocalyptic sectary or religious mentality is actually only a matter of comfort or its absence.
25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Nursing declares having seen all apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a class where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed – and less a professor – declared that they believed in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in certain ways we discredit them,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that goes back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The internet has increased these speculations.
“People elsewhere don’t think so,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question whether he would know a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines are not involved in the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception from a higher instance.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days of the last court were spoken, saying that if nothing happens on December 21st, “people immediately think of a new date” or philosophically that December 21st was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrate about “the end of the world.”
“Perhaps I’m calling a few friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
