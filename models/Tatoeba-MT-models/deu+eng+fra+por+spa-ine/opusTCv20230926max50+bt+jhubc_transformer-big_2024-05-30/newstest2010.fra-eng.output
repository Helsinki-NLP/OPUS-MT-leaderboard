Barack Obama will be the fourth US President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo in Norway to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The diploma, medal and $1.4 million cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration between nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's schedule then schedules an interview with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will take place in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth President of the United States to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the award in the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he is aware that he is receiving this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to emphasize.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish krones (about 1.1 million euros).
He intends to donate it to charities, but has not yet decided concretely which ones.
His charged program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was quite reluctant at this price at first.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he does not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a prize for himself alone, but for all who defend the same values as him.
As soon as he announced, he said it would be a "invitation to act."
A nature defender accused of blackmail
The police of Litoměřice charged the president of the Association of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice with blackmailing.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction works and requested money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for withdrawing his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokeswoman for the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in custody and at risk of up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting tanks are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you find sorting tanks at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before finding the right tanks.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of tanks dedicated to these waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle downtown?
This is a whole science, which requires mostly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found for the moment is the Moravian square opposite Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues do not want me to do so, but it seems pretty little to me.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it is not a sinister either.
So, in the end, many of my friends do not sort their waste.
By laziness.
It makes them a stroller to get to the tanks.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, proposed to go throw some glass and PVC bottles.
Except that I haven't seen any color tanks in Kounicova street.
Fortunately, I found the right place when taking the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
After all, it is the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and so-called aesthetics are not too interesting to the socialists of Brno.
They prefer to buy the city a seat in the first league of hockey that shames the city across the country, rather than buying a few extra tanks and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I’m happy to have been able to strengthen my impression with official statistics after dragging for a while on the internet.
According to data from the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst of the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget removed money from retirement and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the views of the government, farmers and officials, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, Finance Minister Eduard Janota says.
When Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government would borrow for sensitive spending, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems back, undermining the ground," said Janota.
It should be noted that on the money borrowed the interest to be paid is increasingly higher and that sooner or later it will have to be returned.
The state doesn’t really have a choice where to draw money.
If he does not lower social assistance or his expenses, he will have to increase taxes.
To all whom the left has grown today: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then to their children.
People will touch them and should not be afraid for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater state debt - so next year it will not lack 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, debt will grow faster and faster and with it, interest-related expenditures.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government has done in its anti-deficit package.
It will also lack $5 billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and initiated sections of which it is not possible to modify projects to eventually reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also at risk, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to resolve the financial deficit very cleverly - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ (electric power supplier and distributor), which the state owns mostly and will fuel the transportation fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were navigated from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, the dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to complete the pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is preparing.
Furthermore, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensation to victims of communism and crimes, and even housing savings, has decreased by nearly three billion.
It is not certain whether the state can act without that money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department’s side or, at worst, touch the government’s budget reserve.
There is also a lack of one hundred million dollars in the two-billion state fund project, which is to track the expenditure of each administration online.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, the Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the U.S. company VMware, which is primarily concerned with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, VMware’s Srinivas Krishnamurti said in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is not fictional.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously runs the Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to devices in 2012.
Snow scarcity in the mountains troubles hoteliers
Desert runways are not only a problem for lift operators.
The lack of snow deters people from booking their skiing stays in hotels and pensions.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users browse offers, ask for prices but dare not commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerův Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate to book too much.
If we give priority to the savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of Špindler are currently offering only one-week stays for the New Year.
I think they're going to try to put them in for a while, but they're going to give up too and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," said Jandura.
The tourism agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in the Christmas week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper last minute Christmas stays,” said Ingtours Director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourism agency can also offer New Year's Day in Krkonoše, but there are fewer places free.
The first fourteen days of February are just as well, the remaining winter stays are sold medium.
This year’s interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks cover during the week, Christmas will also be complete," Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about 5%.
We have a few last places left for New Year as well as Christmas.
There is a great interest during the January holidays of the Poles and February sells well as well," says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the latest hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at the moment.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest in stays in the Krkonoše will certainly still grow, said Omnia hotel manager Erik Sporysch.
However, the hoteliers of Krkonoše should not expect more snow.
On Thursday it will be colder and if there is rain, it should be snow in the mountains.
But later on, the weather is expected to warm up, informs Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It becomes even comical, the assiduous effort with which Barack Obama, president with the reputation of a wise, reproduces his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself regarded as quite simple.
When he eventually let his doctrine sweat so much awaited, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content with using in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward."
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements into an Iraq consumed by the civil war as being “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which came from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful to such an extent that at present the newspapers are not talking about Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favorable final situation than could be expected.
Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again in Afghanistan
Again, it was the campaign commanders who asked him to increase the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he scammed at least the general of 10,000 soldiers.
It managed to remove the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally had 10,000.
What brings the most problems in the entire Obama strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this whole process within three years.
Many doubt that a half increase will bring the same fruit as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan stands out from the exact opposite - no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
In these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders day-to-day according to their convenience.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only dust in the eyes behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is singularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity in relations, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "fast-to-act state", which is the core purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy makes him perplexed by his volunteerism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out-of-reality heart can be persuaded that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war in order to "come home soon" will bring a real miracle there.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will consider it as an indirect confession to the US defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans’ willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush Mountains.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of Iran-related events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions have no effect on Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of solving the problem by using military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will result in a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rusticity for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it proves to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior-placed senior employees of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash premiums this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 top leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell until five years.
Actions can be withdrawn from leaders in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to link remuneration with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after putting aside nearly $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will likely exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, high banking premiums have become a sensitive political topic in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to allocate a single tax of fifty percent on the bonuses of bankers exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
There are five women, a record number, who today received the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature from King Charles XVI of Sweden in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, and their fellow countryman Jack Szostak received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The Chemistry Prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The latest winner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that did not have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with William Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of the monetary award.
It reaches ten million Swedish kronas in each category. (approximately €1.1 million)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward between them.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversial nature of his reward since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
To the discharge of his policy he added that in some situations war is indispensable to achieve peace, even if the price of it is high.
Minister Janota considers resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who weighs his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the House of Deputies
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday appointment.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
In his view, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of 163 billion Crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the House of Deputies on Wednesday validated the left’s proposals for money transfers and increased the remuneration of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached the proposals of the Social Democrats that they would indirectly increase the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, disagreement that questioned the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as approved by MPs, removes the savings package passed by Fischer's government and that it believes it must curb the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the bill on the state budget but does not require it, said today in a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrefrenable deficiency" of public finances.
At the moment, he believes, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make improvement if it could rely on a broader political consensus, the president said.
SDG President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is frightening and the government should challenge its subsequent existence.
SDG Vice President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the SDG and the Greens clearly no longer works.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts."
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is frightening and will exceed 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the ČSSD described the ratification of the state budget for next year as successful.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invictu will expose a lot to the world about the country, its struggles and its victories.
The story is about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, plays the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president.
Freeman said that it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama in the middle of boxing has, for example, played the leader of a movement against slavery himself becomes a slave, a fictional president of the United States, perhaps even God in the film Man's Ever-Mighty One.
The former South African statesman has been imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country.The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains still and still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is persuaded to be able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world ranking.
The South African team will eventually advance in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose than to play this role in a way that brings it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same area, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get back from your energy, it is transmitted and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I ringed at the door of the house, it opened me and the first thing I told Francois Pienaar was, 'I look much bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between real actors and models, Invictus under the direction of director Eastwood has received positive reviews and even ambitions for the Oscars.
Daily Variety's film reviewer Todd McCarthy summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well-directed film."
In film ratings on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed above Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only acknowledged yesterday having tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket near Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" type missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually becomes the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in the tests of the rocket did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava did not fly away, or it damaged itself in full flight.
Russian newspapers talk about “Bulava” as “a missile that doesn’t fly”
A missile that doesn’t fly but shines
This 13th trial took place at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the apparatus.
It was obviously the third-stage engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be just fired from a moving boat and submerged.
This is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was likely caused by a defective "Bulava".
Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage hit only the third.
In previous cases, engines have experienced failures on the first floor.
Even though none of the test launches have gone smoothly, the Department of Defense’s leadership considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures.
This success rate of nearly fifty percent thus fills the generals with optimism and therefore they still claim that one day "Bulava" will fly smoothly and that it will even carry ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again perform in a professional match at 51 years old.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will lend a strong hand to his Moscow CSKA team in need and will likely make his entry already in Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov regularly trains and agrees to help the team.
We still have to fix some details on the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will be only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, said Nyemchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Fetissov quintet, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union, he won twice the gold at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also won tributes in the NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Temple of Hockey Reputation since 2001.
Hyundai listens to trade unions and cancels every overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It is precisely because of frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
Hyundai factory spokesman Petr Vaněk confirmed this.
The management, however, still wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked this year again.
We can’t give up our production plan, it’s essential, that’s why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, knowing there would be two teams, Vaněk said.
The website Sedmička.cz said the company has offered a bonus of 400 Czech krones to employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Vaněk, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the additional hours, or they can place an alternative leave on December 28 and thus extend their holidays indicated Vaněk.
In addition, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hot point in the comments and claims of unions and employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, the management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Until last week, employees at the car factory were forced to work almost two extra hours a day in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike status after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the automotive factory and the unions is scheduled to take place Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to cease the strike state if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation at the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and so-called bizutages.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work additionally to fulfill the car production requirements.
Upon the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also asked that employees who ceased production should not be subject to any penalties.
Trade unions are calling on the company to reduce time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want a reward of 5,000 crowns (209 €) this year.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It started mass production last year in November.
It has produced about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "enduring" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the proliferation of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the top of the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
Nevertheless, the life of patients can be drastically extended through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption leads to a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have any effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, the VŠCHT in Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on the protein responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
Metalocarborans are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way than all drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers’ work leads them to discover new “improved” substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bindings to the virus’ proteins.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is indispensable for the virus' life cycle.
Without HIV division caused by HIV protease, there would be no rise of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus into the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test samples and on its resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
In the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarborans is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on the resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as their biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to consider further toward the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína <0xC5><0x98>ezáčová, director of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry.
The SDG attacks Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the SDG (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek, called the budget ratified for the following year "deleting" and he said the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should challenge its existence.
The Prime Minister called the SDG's statement a drastic verdict.
He says it takes time to analyze.
SDG spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the ČSSD, the SDG and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to support the minority in the House of Deputies that is concerned with fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned with remaining in his duties with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDG and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Deputies on Wednesday ratified the 2010 budget, with proposals for amendments to the amount of 12 billion krones included by the left.
The House increased the money for official salaries, functioning social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance of the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of <0xC2><0xA3>163 billion.
The SDG left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of uselessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to withdraw from office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the Prime Minister after his passing to the government:
At the same time, he said he was wondering whether he would remain in his duties.
His disappointment with the negotiations around the budget is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the services law.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDG are not at issue.
This is the case of the head of government Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers appointed by the SDG have done nothing harmful, Topolánek said in a text statement from the United States.
He recalled that deputy ministers in some departments claim TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of fighting against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that it is based on the left majority that is currently in the House."
That said, it should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven't thought about it, and once it's on the agenda then I'll devote myself to it, Defence Minister Martin Barták, just elected to the government by the Democrats, told reporters from the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDG has turned back at the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the SDG would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not expressly asked Democratic MPs to allow the vote on the budget.
We do not feel orphans, we are not little children, he responded to the question of whether the SDG had not been reproached by the Party President in the House or in the country during the negotiation of the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missing.
I already knew at the time I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevising of the House and a destruction of everything positive, Topolánek responded in person.
According to the new timetables of the ČD there will be fewer trains for the same rates.
The Czech Railways will remove or limit some less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will rather strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease by 2% on the day the new schedules come into force compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including basic rates and reduced rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino railway.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the direct line Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transport affects the Hradec Králové region by eight percent in total, while Prague and its surroundings can rejoice in an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the greatest transformations is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main train station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will not be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from December 13.
This year’s invoice for regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year in total four billion crowns to pay for visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them in total eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in the amount of nearly three billion.
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
The Railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they did not resort to a price increase for the vast majority of transportation tickets.
The changes will only affect one-day ČD Net tickets and discounted eLiška internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiska will newly depend on the route travelled, while until then it was valid between cities in a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels still detain more than 50 people, children released
The rebels kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency who informed, but spoke originally of only 65 hostages.
The seventeen children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The capture of hostages took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 rebels were reported to have used the hostages as human shields during a police escape.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused by settling accounts between two family clans.
The martial law was declared in the southern province of Maguindanao because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the elections of the governor's administration were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of participation in the massacre, along with his father Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa’s history concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the US in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned fighter against apartheid returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, feedback from critics and audiences are heard.
Nelson Mandela
From his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film has great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is preparing for the World Cup in football, and the media is agitated by alarming news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants on the part of the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are rather positive in South Africa at the moment, despite frequent reservations made to the main roles where Hollywood stars “pave.”
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless proud of the film by taking back his own terms.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have been well prepared.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally many times to recover from his energy, he said during the film's official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual he added.
Wear the national rugby team jersey
In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries to rejoin two racial groups from a long-divided population and, along with Nelson Mandela in 1995, he enters the South African team's national jersey on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the jersey lawn, which is regarded in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had long been ovated fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Hopefully the football championship will succeed in bringing people together again into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve.
South African whites are, however, skeptical, as recently entrusted in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
Transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire swallowed in the morning a transformer of the Čeps company from the distribution center near the municipality of Vyškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for Ústí firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally planned to let the transformer consume, but they reviewed their opinions and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokeswoman of the company Pavla Mandátova the incident does not jeopardize the secure operation of the transmission unit.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She added that in a decade of activity, Čeps has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been interrupted, said ČEZ spokeswoman for North Bohemia Soňa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of households, administrations and industries was not affected by the fire of the processing plant.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator on the Czech territory of 400 kV and 220 kV transmission units and power lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transport assemblies to the distribution assemblies and line layouts with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jančura to file a lawsuit for defamation against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of the Student Agency, will file a defamation lawsuit against three Democratic social prefects today.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravian region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the Prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned this in Radiožurnál's Dvacet minut.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions finally signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three have attacked us and claim that we are doing the fine mouths, while we have only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech railways, which is not true because we know the Czech railway prices that were signed last week.
So we only have to defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for libels about the Student Agency company, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he stated that he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek considers Mr. Jančura’s complaint to be the continuation of his media show, which serves as a free advertising for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I guess this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr. Jančura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, Hašek says.
Jančura already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavorable actions of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he plans to resume it after New Year.
He said the campaign would target corruption in a broad sense.
Jančura began its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways to operate rail links for an order of about 150 billion CZK, without issuing tenders.
According to Jančura, such an act is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jančura threats from a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I don’t know who it is, but I won’t say his name,” Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will overthrow old habits in January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voces are already rising, saying mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination culminate.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets for vaccines the maximum prices that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated against pneumococcus free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th months of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcus.
However, the parents paid 1,600 crowns or even more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that health insurance spends between 300 and 450,000 crowns each year on vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all children's vaccinations.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and blood poisoning.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Aside from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions about a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
As of January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said that mandatory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that needs to be followed now, Kalovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of pneumococcal vaccination.
We are absolutely not considering it at the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
Optional vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Specialized Society of Pediatricians, acknowledges that a vaccination based on volunteerism has its defects.
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a reduction in vaccination renewals "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," says Cabrnochová, however.
Specialists predict that by next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination also marks a break because it is the first child vaccination that is funded by insurance and not by the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves.
This is, however, related to the concerns of pediatricians practitioners, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products supplied by the state.
Some MEPs feared, however, that this would allow insurance companies to "deduct the amounts of health insurance."
Doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to repay them.
It is estimated that individual pediatricians will have to invest nearly 40,000 crowns a month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum theft"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of attempting to steal paintings worth $20 million (12 million GBP) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the news agency Associated Press (AP) reported.
AP cited a police official that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, said Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been allowed by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied having given such authorization, the agency said.
Labour defends the increase in the budgetary tax.
The ministers defended the increase in taxes and the spending reductions announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about decreasing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a 1% ceiling on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The unions have protested that low wages are penalized by a recession that they are not responsible for and have warned that “problems” are announcing them.
The decrease in social insurance—which will bring about GBP 3 billion a year—has made the world of businesses angry because he says it is a tax on jobs while the goal should be a recovery of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those who earn more than GBP 20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will decline further than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% Tax on Bankers Bonuses
Increased corporate profit tax for small businesses has been abandoned
Reduced taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
An increase in pensions of 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, a person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and a person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while a person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
The ministers said their goal to halve the deficit before 2013 led to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the first 5% of employees.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied an increase in the tax and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "drop of water in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
“These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit in two, which will be absolutely indispensable over the next four years,” he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy would restart at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely drop 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April - while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Opportunity missed"
Conservatives, which will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday warning against Labour's "debt crisis," said the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" avoiding difficult choices until the elections - which are scheduled to take place in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Treasury Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"The important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of who is the winner."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from upcoming reductions, unlike the Tory proposals that would lead to a faster and more significant decrease in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through increased taxes and decreased spending would be used to support next year’s spending and not to decrease the deficit, arguing that the plans were “built on wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, said the schedule of announcements - such as rising inflation for some disability benefits in April next, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor faced with propaganda charges, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, the Labour emphasises that additional assistance is being provided while people need it most and that the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish expenditure details beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the Chancellor’s figures involve, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defence.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said its Director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, no matter who winner,” said Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte’s accountants.
"This was a fake pre-budget report, which the markets realize."
FBI Investigates 'American Arrests in Pakistan'
The FBI investigates the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid at a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether it was the same men who had been declared missing from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Foreign Ministry said it was also seeking information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni descent.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the accusations are against them and under what conditions they are detained," Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncle.
She said the house was already under local police surveillance and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, Reuters news agency reported, but said the United States must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were taken missing from their homes by their families in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian ‘abuse’
In the past 20 years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to the Amnesty International report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man cited in the report claimed that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its non-respect for human rights.
Authorities have stated that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the biggest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent says.
"False confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting against the results of the election.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under the eyes, on the neck, on the head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the election-losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that demonstrators detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had occurred.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he was locked up in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary should set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and government response, but said the mandate and powers of these agencies were not clear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further protests.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn Bristol’s site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders in competition for prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park trail, a small trampoline was ahead of a 100m long trail.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was magnificent but it was pretty intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city shimmering below.
Here are some of the country’s best skiers and snowboarders – real talents,” he added.
Awards have awarded the best voltages - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night, the snow will be abandoned to the melt.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s last book presents a much wider and more ambitious frame.
Good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He has spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bolzen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He is very well able to listen to and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that worry the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who today make up a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the secularism of the French might be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each camp.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the intellectual guardian elite so virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, the Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values."
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that makes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fisheries are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a Thin Layer of Ice", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the Great North, the Polar Bear.
Knowledge of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves in hunting the white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous 14-year-old aspirant who had only to fight the tip of his mosquet, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally one millionth of the area needed for an adult in freedom. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often comes back to the threat that hunters pose to species survival.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter fighters and Inuit Indians on motorcycle ski use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and scary summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what may be the future there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospherists nor oceanographers can accurately report the speed of change.
It's not because of trying.
At the end of the 19th and early 20th century, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys gave the first information about the melting of the ice sheet.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the changes in relief underneath it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the arctic ice system, formed by nets of brine water pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.

Marines, among 6,000 people who laid crowns on tombs in Arlington
The 19-year-old first classman, De'Angelo Robinson, took a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple crown on the tomb of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were in their place.
Within a few months, where we will be sent from, we risk being in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay crowns on the tombs of veterans in different sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and other people decided to decorate several hundred graves at the Arlington Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of the Arlington Cemetery around the Pentagon, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City, and on the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial site.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she had travelled to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
This is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Embedded in several layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose old tombs, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as from the Vietnam War, because these are not visited as often as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the kids played and the couples held by hand, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the gray tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on the top.
Nearby, there was silence on Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark mood of current wars filled the area.
Individuals cryed without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the small black and white information cards, plunged into the wet ground for those whose tomb had not yet been finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many tearing mothers on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and drove eight hours to come to the tomb of Marine Gunnery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget how we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. national arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. national who distributed mobile phones and laptops across the country, the U.S. Foreign Ministry’s services said.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to have access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The accusations have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are husbands and she is being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. national will perhaps increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can return the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country or the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to purchase mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day’s salary.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often need to communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed—distributing mobile phones free of charge—is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of Human Rights Watch, who recently published a strict report on Cuba’s freedoms, called “New Castro, even Cuba,” referring to the establishment of Raul Castro as the country’s leader to replace Fidel, his sick brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction to the United States, as the two countries begin to start a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization supposedly preparing a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan in order to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who arm the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
Investigators claimed they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality known as Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, away from the forbidden mountains of the northeast and became a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered infiltrated agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed his opinion on the condition of keeping anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities said that the men were determined and still trying to obtain the necessary permissions to obtain entry into al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interviewed by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence services have prioritized infiltrating men into the al-Qaeda network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spy.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups also need to pay more and more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept as U.S. intelligence services have become experts on their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment pattern that so many other people have already followed?
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for “action” for climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked down the streets here on Saturday, calling for more action on the climate from negotiators working in the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a small number of masked activists lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On that day when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate discussions, thousands of activists walked around the city, rolling out signs in English saying “There is no Planet B” and one in Spanish, declaring “The Earth says it’s enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said traveling to her mother’s home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the tearing problems the country faces due to the impact of climate change already occurring.
That’s one of the reasons I decided to join the big march—to spread the word and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented the protesters from coming too close to the Bella center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they wore a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passenger who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothing lit several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They were throwing them near the buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some major explosions."
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around TV screens to follow the walk throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters failed to awaken the awareness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China’s climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring, "Because the event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking could seem harmful or useful from perspectives.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or damage the freedom of others."
Test results reveal persistent gaps between breeds
Last week’s federal mathematics outcome report brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District remains far behind the headquarters, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have progressed far more in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures in the National Assessment of Educational Progress show the persistent gap between African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington DC have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased over this period, the difference only decreased to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by the Director of Educational Institutions Group Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), was driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality in District education.
I don’t jump out of joy for one or two points earned, said Kwame R. Brown (apparently Democrat), D.C. Council Member and whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said that the test results message is that the city’s middle schools desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what’s scary is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This autumn, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, targeting students in the graduate and early school grades who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their school journeys and who are quite late compared to their comrades.
Every day, the mathematics program, for kindergarten (maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former director Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these lower-level students, Rhee said.
Others believe that NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise overall system outcomes while providing money and resources for schools with poorer outcomes to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley, California who studies the results of the tests of the cities.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington’s poorest neighborhoods.
Thus, this targeting can have political consequences that hinder this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that like the other school superintendents, she is trying to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they originate, are assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements in reducing the success gap was the duration of the traditional public school, today 180 days in Washington District, to compete with Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "start point" to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped at Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, comes down and blinks for a moment at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of a new impressed student than enthusiastic.
Here's where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance of the building of science.
Youpi, really? said she dreamy, when she was told of the low ratio law professor-student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that children visited during their three-day discovery journey and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to college:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises widely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents as a teenager, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five Hispanic "second generation" continues to study in high school -- a remarkable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
The researchers who study the beatings say they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentorship programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college—especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention at any time will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a network of support to these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize college preparation programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering the university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq’s oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies have returned with a stake in just two of the 10 fields auctioned.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that started on Friday.
The only one who placed an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies have obtained contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a news site on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops withdraw, have braked U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering more forcefully Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude oil reserve, analysts say.
In some cases, American companies were disadvantaged due to their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more ready to take risks because they did not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and provided it with technical advice, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has bidd more on contracts than other companies and has returned with significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be equal with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit auctions made bids that were then compared to the barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above the current levels for each field.
One of Al Qaeda's leading organizers allegedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American missile, hitting along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, U.S. counter-espionage authorities said Friday.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within Pakistan’s anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car heading toward the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence service member said, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Authority officials said suspicious local activists rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of "completely shattered bodies."
It was totally impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two U.S. anti-terrorist representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as one of the al-Qaeda Military Organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize conspiracies around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to keep anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic directions of al-Qaeda leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the U.S. authority said that Somalia had rapidly progressed in the ranks of al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American general public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official representative said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be al-Qaeda’s second major figure or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has decreased since the summer, from about six operations a month to two, according to figures advanced by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to decrease their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site says.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday he was resigning from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous term filled with widespread allegations of corruption during the UN-backed presidential elections.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the US schedule for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but would simply keep his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month void between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura was cited; he was an Italo-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and hiding evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said that Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- "have harmed the mission because there was already a good amount of skepticism regarding international election observation."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that UN officials allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration over the limitations of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN hiring regulations were disrupting his opportunities to bring new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world's major powers will soon impose "important additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a bed of 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs on me the most is that if I have learned something in Iraq over the past six years, that’s the unpredictable side inherent in the war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates said some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said a "set of motivations and punishments" could be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be in poorer security with nuclear weapons" because "its people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face “likely” consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its surveillance body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment for peaceful purposes alone.
In the Geneva talks on October 1, he said he would resume the dialogue on reducing its nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant portion of its storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a means of building confidence on both sides and saving time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran seems to have moved away from attempts to agree - in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided about whether or not to engage with the United States.
"Frankly, in my opinion, Iran's stiffening in the face of some of the proposals of the international community for which they had actually agreed in early October has prompted the international community, including the Russian and Chinese, to join on what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians," Gates said.
President Obama set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before it turns to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement in New York on Thursday, the Iran mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by certain Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities and stated that it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington late Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before taking a plane to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet troop leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions remain between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
The U.S. authorities quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, President of Kurdistan's regional government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you.”
In China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters serving them, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "A baby in addition, it's an additional tomb."
They learned so well the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good and spoiled cheeks, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The population distribution, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, which is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission) said that fertile couples must have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent lack of workforce in the future."
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to date, undoubtedly, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
Chinese authorities have attributed the duty to the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women with a second child to abort.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007 they softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child have been replaced by copies of regulations detailing who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and drag prospectuses under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planner, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say they saw an increase in demands for couples wanting a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the countryside, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally permitted to have two children.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly consider the single child policy to be a rights issue, Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child, said.
It's true, we're stolen the luck of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she wanted only one child because she was one of them herself. "We were the center of the family and we used to everyone care for us."
We are not used to taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says this more strongly.
For middle-class couples working for two who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish if you can succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up seeing their parents fight in the early times of capitalist China and do not want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space issues -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only nine months old, you need to write his CV to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for emissions reduction
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recrimination -- returned to the flames of the ramp on Friday, as a result of the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming times.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it illuminated the way to go.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in time-lacking negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
Drafted by a special UN working group, the text does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to support global warming, both in the long run and in the long run.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could decrease their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that officials would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Sierra Club Washington Representative.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN Executive Secretary-General on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, described as being "the full picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, 25 to 45 percent from 1990 levels, while major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year for the next three years to help poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to support floods and drought or to prevent deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations have occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, U.S. Climate Negotiation Representative, rejected any discussion requiring greenhouse gas reduction by industrialized countries, compared to voluntary efforts by major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder to China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of major developing countries, Stern said he also regretted that the text did not insist enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei declared that the U.S. chief negotiator either lacked "good sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the U.S. would not financially help China to fight global warming.
With future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, defects have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than about rescuing the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations as the poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was no surprise that major powers were struggling to find out who should suffer the costs of decreasing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempts to make major issuers responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also climate advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries, more vulnerable to the impact of climate change, said they would continue to put pressure for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most key participants say the negotiations will lead to a minimum, political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, has drafted a 24-page treaty proposal, early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unity, said the action of small island states has “put political pressure on the entire political process,” in part because they are now unified and calling on emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The debates became an urgent issue, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to solve most of the problems pending before the heads of governments reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister dropped out of their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make complaints that will be considered over the next week.
The true image of the gathering—in which 13,000 people come in and out of the Palais des Congrès every day—guitar player activists perform night shows mocking countries that they think are betraying each other and proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email—is a real challenge.
The intensity is only growing: almost all major ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the courtyard of the great, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy of Conservation International.
The heavy cars are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. Monday morning, a whistle will pierce at night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, while it will depart from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transportation, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and will connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, the duration of business trips will be much shorter and the passage from plane and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties join this project.
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new railroad network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental hazards risk braking British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next planned step for the high-speed network.
The new line between London and West Midlands will be designed within five meters of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial.
In the countryside, the map will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will offer three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch going west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another branch going northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is done, the travel time from London to Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel from London to Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to an hour trip currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the UK’s fastest network in the world.
The initial track is designed to allow trains 400m long and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until a general election.
Even if he starts the machine, the grid will have to be built part by part.
The trains will first be forced to ride off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, with travel times between London and Scotland longer than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution for ensuring a transition from aircraft to trains, making it a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Reimburse GBP 75,000 Loan for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the top member of the Tory parliament, has paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his district.
The party leader who was downgraded by David Cameron to complain that parliamentarians were "entertained," raised his borrowing by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home, Rutland.
He had been allowed to pay the taxpayer additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds a month.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who monitors members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland district - Melton.
The nearby houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emoluments office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
The neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to give an explanation for the borrowing increase during a recent investigation by the Committee on Privileges and Standards of the Commons concerning its pre-borrowing provisions.
Last month, the Committee found him guilty of any charges of non-compliance with the rules, following an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of borrowing GBP 271,406 from his London property to the home of his electoral district he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
Documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of interest from borrowing until March of last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The variable standard RBS interest rate rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without shifting since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to request GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Ghost Cabinet Manager in September after an undercover journalist filmed him saying parliamentarians had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
In fact, it is now national, you have to live "on budget" and you are treated as "of the m...e"
He said, “I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil dealer, began to have to explain his expenses in May, after it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the cost office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>-shaped hole in Mr. Duncan's lawn, protesting after it was revealed that he had requested GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the borrowing increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved by both the fee office and Legg."
He added: "There is no problem of stealing or developing or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn’t be clearer or simpler.”
Faithful, come all to see the Brighton Advent Calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for every day of December, using as theme, Christmas songs.
The event started on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., each day, with pastes and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs so far chosen include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest of the diocese of Chichester and director of Beyond.
He said, “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why are we waiting for people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate more captivatingly.
"The idea of the advent calendar of the beach cabin came right after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we are trying to experiment and represent it through spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday calling for an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police conducted several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the UN Climate Conference, which is tasked with reaching an agreement that can come into force on January 1, 2013.
For Danish climate conference chair Connie Hedegaard, the growing global climate mobilization, illustrated by these demonstrations, has contributed to making "the political price" of a very high failure in Copenhagen.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the court departure, when a group of 300 protesters, fully dressed in black, broke windows with strokes of pavements and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
The riot police immediately intervened carelessly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that had shown themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were still held on the street Saturday night" "handcuffed and kept in a seated position despite the extreme cold."
The parliamentary party, the courtyard, rather good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, the site of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without attempting to enter it.
A scene had been set up to accommodate the scheduled speakers, before a candle wake with the participation of former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters had come by bus and train from major cities in Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the appeal of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to form "blue tides" for "climate justice."
Today, we go down the streets to seek repayment for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist for the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to think: we have time, estimated Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterworld movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
The French MP José Bové, a figure of the altermondialism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched the protests.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, featuring bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, rallyes of a few hundred protesters also took place to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the "350" network gathered a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, as Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Approximately 131,000 people were expected to participate in this first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian War for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% just hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhazi Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on Saturday night.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, strongly reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the poll.
These elections are a farce.
Georgia’s President Mikheil Saakashvili “disappoints that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia,” his spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world regards it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousands, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch, told AFP.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in the capital city of Sukhumi, in a nice white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential elections in this sumptuous landscape region, on the banks of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed pretty much everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to Russian officials who came to monitor the running of the polls.
We, the Abkhazia people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
On the other hand, the opposition represented by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes agreements with Moscow last year, such as ceding control over Abkhazian railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus a vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: protests worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where police arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The parliamentary party, the generally good child, took the lead of the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without attempting to enter it.
A scene had been set up to accommodate the scheduled speakers, before a candle wake with the participation of former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the court departure, a group of a few hundred protesters, fully dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP journalist noted.
The riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened carelessly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, saying they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", these ultra-violent groups that had shown themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the arrest of about 20 people, police said.
We have the extremist groupuscles in our eyes, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while the police helicopters were turning in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, coming by bus and train from major cities in Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue waterproof, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the appeal of Friends of the Earth, who wanted to form "blue tides" for "climate justice."

French MEP José Bové, a figure of altermondialism, told AFP he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched the protests.
About 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.

Geo-history emerges strengthened from general high school reform, according to Chatel
National Education Minister Luc Chatel said in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography were coming out "strengthened" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their mandatory education in the scientific terminal.
From now on, first-class students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared culture, says Chatel.
According to the minister, "we have to get out of hypocrisy" because, he says, "the S sector is no longer a scientific sector" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain sub-linears of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals outrage over the absence of the history-geography in the final in the high schools of technology."
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in Humanity found that nearly seven in ten French (69%) disapproved of the government’s plan to remove compulsory history-geography teaching in terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister, however, added that it was "no question" to remove the philosophy of terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for a mobilization day Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will cover their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also follow internships during the M2 year and will be a first year in front of students as internship teachers.
If you add all of the internships offered before the competition, you already get more attendance in front of students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the minister says he will propose "the individual right to training, which does not exist in national education."
It also reaffirms the plan to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge faced Saturday morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (IPCC) invited by the Higher Normal School of Ulm Street.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the conferences "Ernest", a day consisting of a series of expert interventions, each of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, noted an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes his name from that given by the students to the fish in the school's pool.
A twenty speakers are selected from among the experts of their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, “we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key goals in a few minutes,” Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes but using charts, told AFP.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that auditors will retain that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record."
Videos taken from these lectures will be posted online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly rate.
Delays in payments: anger of prison supervisors, planned actions
Prison surveillance unions called on Friday for "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year of the holidays of premiums and overtime whose payment was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who would not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block" them, "to denounce the theft of their dues."
The CGT-Penitentiary (3rd union of the profession) calls on them to "gather in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization," deeming it "homeful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (Ufap/Unsa), “appeals for general mobilization ... to raise discontent and anger.”
The Penitentiary Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but ensure that the remainder will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a mail to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I do not ignore the efforts made by staff for the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I have asked the management of the prison administration to implement without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime does not happen in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be lean, except for the management staff who benefit from the famous premiums of functions and objectives, the Ufap/Unsa said, for whom "budgetary constraints have good backs".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille has been outraged, announcing its decision to boycott "all meetings and convocations" until further notice.
The staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of the month of October are not regularized in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
As we increase our tasks and missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to deal with staff money, the CGT-Penitentiary of Bordeaux estimates.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less poorly lodged than others.
But anyway the account is not there, noted Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says offering "greater tricks" than those he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told the “popesses” of the small screen Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple rule of gifts: “I’m giving things more cool than I get.”
As part of a special show that will be broadcast on Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife Michelle offer an insight into how they intend to celebrate the holidays in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, will be part of the game.
Santa Claus also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, saying the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama has falsified her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Not sure, I gave you nice gifts last year," she said.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before replying with humor by showing the First Lady's pearl necklace with his finger: "Who gave you this?"
During this one-hour show, in the casual atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember that time when I met my father coming to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It was only a long time later in my life that I realized that it was him who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn’t know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house,” said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL says he is in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reoperated on Wednesday night at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the disc hernia suffered in Paris on November 26, his press service told Paris, specifying that the injuries had "needed a repairing operation."
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure itself that the situation was "under control," while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be released no later than 48 hours.
According to RTL, a partner of the singer’s latest tour, Johnny Hallyday was reportedly in an artificial coma to avoid “pain and complications.”
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he has opened an eye, RTL adds.
Asked by the AFP, the press service neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic for this disc hernia.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
This was not available on Thursday night to comment on RTL’s information.
Following the surgery he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a loved one of Johnny Hallyday, said on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass," but assured him of "no worries" about the rocker, who is "a beating".
He called me just before leaving to Los Angeles, and I told him that it was crap because flying twelve hours after such an operation is not playable, said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "terminated".
Mr. Camus also said he had talked with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed to have been surgery for a "small colon cancer", then a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been abundantly commented. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer’s difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the World Cup 2009 in a large pool, won an international title on a distance he particularly loves, the 50m free swimming, at the Euro 2009 in a small pool in Istanbul on Thursday.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while awaiting a deflection.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relays gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who scored on the world record of the 50m free, whose brand he holds in large pool (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m free, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who imposed himself in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first internationally.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisioned.
We can always dream better and in the darkness, I had said that if the world record was at my fingertips, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from January 1.
Initiating 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epic event in Istanbul, which hosted the first ones in 1999, at the same competition.
The use of the suits did not serve this time to German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower the mark he holds on 400m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless imposed himself by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t take this race thoroughly.
I knew I couldn’t beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
USA: Sarcophage panel belonging to Zola awarded $1.5 million
A sign of Roman sarcophagus belonging to French writer Emile Zola was awarded on Thursday $1.5 million, clearly above his estimate, the art merchant Sotheby's announced.
This front panel, two meters long and 63 cm high, dating from the third century AD, was estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four dionysiac scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, Vice President of the Art Auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one that buyers have been bidding the most so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The panel remained nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of her bathtub in her Parisian private hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly chairman of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
It remained a shadow area of about fifty years.
By searching the database of the Louvre Museum, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of a "succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's aborted departure attempt from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied a safe conduct by the coup government.
At the moment, after a phone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not gathered, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
Arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The coup government wanted to force Zelaya to “resign” and seek political asylum abroad to grant him a safe conduct.
But the resigned president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a guest-in-exercise head of state.
The coup government "should have failed again by wanting me to give up my office (...) they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told radio Globo on Thursday, about which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the country of Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing a few chords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy submitted an application for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, the Interior Minister of the coup government, Oscar Raul Matute, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I don’t seek asylum from any country,” Manuel Zelaya told Telesur, headquartered in Caracas.
An eventual departure from Honduras will have to be made as the president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Zelaya's departure rumors had mobilized Wednesday supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the government’s position.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government with respect to international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan Socialist President Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the opinion of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" accused by justice, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya’s return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures showing a recovery in both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the technologically dominant Nasdaq 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index scored 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1,102.35 points.
Good news comes from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, estimating that the market was focused on "half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo, Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the U.S. balance sheet figures, “which show that business is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts expected the deficit to rise.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth of trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth of the economies of major U.S. trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against any expectation last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest level in a year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury voucher increased to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday night and that of the 30-year voucher to 4.492% compared to 4.408% the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power consue the "Ladies in White"
A few hundred supporters of Cuban power convicted wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day on Thursday, and prevented another demonstration for which a dozen dissidents were arrested.
Around forty "Ladies in White", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were consued in the middle of the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist noted.
Down the Yankees!, “mercenaries!”, “the street belongs to the revolutionaries!”, “Live Fidel and Raul!” shouted, with the fist lifted, the proponents of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian officers who came to "secure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Vedado neighborhood in Havana, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to demonstrate on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by civilian police, an AFP journalist said.
Police forced dissidents into civilian vehicles that were conspued by government supporters, the journalist said.
The arrests of dissidents in similar circumstances generally last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "White Ladies" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", a number of 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda serves a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda was part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remained under lockdown.
Cuban authorities regard opponents as “mercenaries” or “agents” to the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration of pro-government activists against “counter-revolutionaries”.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced man killed an eighteen-year-old with a knife and wounded five in Clichy-la-Garenne
A forced man armed with two knives killed an eighteen-year-old and wounded five others in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne, Hauts-de-Seine, at an hour of affluence, Thursday late on the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant reportedly struck with two knives and for undetermined reasons an eighteen-year-old at or in front of a pharmacy on 85 Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, police sources and witnesses have learned.
Severely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to a police union official Alliance, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The 30-year-old husband intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenar died.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became uncomfortable and was reportedly hospitalized "in a shock state," according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would then have fled into the street, always Jean Jaurès boulevard.
He would have injured two passengers, apparently randomly: one thirty and one forty, the latter seriously.
The scenario was confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he wore crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, an Alliance union official in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the forced.
I saw a guy about thirty years old wearing a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was strong, said Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Always boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their officials, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with a fist, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Some passengers came and told me there was a person injured outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I noticed a very serious wound in the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a 30-year-old second person arrived, wounded with a knife.
It was the national police who arrested the man without identity documents.
The prosecutor's office in Nanterre seized the investigation from the departmental judicial police department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The forced was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard as part of his custody.
A police source did not exclude him from being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" as "all the forced ones of this species whose forces double under the effect of action."
USA: Polanski’s lawyer once again calls for a waiver of prosecution
Lawyer for French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) called for the abandonment of prosecution against his client, currently in residence in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", denounced serious procedural errors at the time of the events in 1977 before three judges of the California Second District Court of Appeal.
I demand the abandonment of charges here and now, Hummel said, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband, who died since then, discussed, before giving his judgment, with a prosecutor who said to him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious lack of procedure.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared in late September that he "lyed" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court would refuse to drop the proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The indictment reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of charges could be seriously examined until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced, for "illegal sexual relationships" with a 13-year-old girl.
He has never set his feet back to the United States since then.
Deputy Los Angeles County Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to stand before the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker “asks for a favor from the court, while despising its authority.”
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that "there were other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to demand the abandonment of the proceedings against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer bears harassment at every turn in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to residence in his Gstaad cottage, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, braked by dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market drawn between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very small and I think that will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than expected, which "contributed to improving market opinion on the solidity of the economic recovery," Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
In addition, American consumer confidence increased significantly in December, at 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan Index.
The indices have, however, been hampered by a further rise in the dollar, at the highest in the last two months against the euro, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury voucher increased to 3.540% compared to 3.482% Wednesday night and that of the 30-year voucher to 4.497% compared to 4.492% the day before.
Miss World Election Again in South Africa
After a month’s journey through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are preparing to cross the last straight line on Saturday to fulfill their dream: be elected the world’s most beautiful woman in front of a billion viewers.
During this great beauty mass organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already secured their ticket to the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sportive or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I’ve seen so many things and experienced so many things!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday from 5pm (15pm GMT).
I couldn’t dream of a better country to give my crown back.
This experience was fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the warmth of the southern summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press encounters and safari, the Miss now focus on competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000, and Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, launches Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will march in traditional costume and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by television presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and a head of the Miss World committee Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates have like last year made a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted local cuisine.
They also met with South African President Jacob Zuma who shake their hands.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will probably remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the 2010 World Cup in June, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been dating people I never thought I could get closer to.
I will definitely come back for the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi enthusiastically.
Johnny Hallyday’s news is “very positive,” according to David’s son.
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," his son David said on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport where he had to go to the bed of his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, David Hallyday told the press on his departure from the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after local 13:00 (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, said he was going "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a disc hernia on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "in artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to give him his treatment," the news service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday for an infection following a disc hernia surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning to attend a school show, an AFP photographer said.
The head of the orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit Los Angeles with the singer on Monday.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were upset, Camus said.
I have heard of a possible court proceedings to come, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus said Johnny Hallyday was “too fast leaving for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon.”
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that had amazed me, given that I had myself two disc hernias, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "leaving without drain, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was exercising at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma following a brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with a sulfurous reputation, convicted several times by justice, in cases of medical liability, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of the Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scrupules" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the intervention had "gone perfectly well" and that the postoperative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have been multiplying since this summer, seems in parenthesis.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, Camus said.
The UDF association raises the tone and summons the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The association UDF, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, reacted Friday to the OPA attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, urging him to no longer use it on any support, under penalty of judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after extending his hand to the left.
The Defence Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (former UMP passed to NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be expelled, came out of his silence to issue a warning to the minister and the MP, calling on them to no longer use the acronym and pass on ownership of the brand, under the penalty of judicial prosecution.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements that you are going to propose to your political movement to take over the UDF, the association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also felt good to track on your militant material and on the guard page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, of the slogan +Today's UDF+, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you do not ignore, you have no right to the use of this acronym, explains the UDF office, which urges the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the UDF's name from any medium as well as (its) website".
He also requests Hervé de Charette to "transfer the property of the trademark to its legitimate rightholders".
If you didn't, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letters, they stated that the UDF "is a full political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others did in 2002 to create the UMP."
The New Centre therefore, according to them, has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and the establishment of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark," he was "not more member of the UDF in three years", but to the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absent deposit of the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironising on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for weakness abuse
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as billionaire Liliane Bettencourt's daughter accuses her, he took advantage of a state of weakness from the octogenary to rob her of a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punished by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of €375,000.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the wealthiest families in France, in which mother and daughter torn apart while holding the reigns of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt’s medical expertise should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not under the conditions proposed by the prosecutor's office in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a weak state and at what periods.
I think she'll submit to it.
I will talk to her about it, Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr. Georges Kiejman, said at the hearing.
For her part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
The expertise will demonstrate that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has been suing François-Marie Banier, a photographer and touch-to-all artist, who she accuses of having taken advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-standing friend.
While the court was to examine the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' action, lawyers' advocacy sometimes turned to the large family unpackage on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I have never been able to talk to her since her marriage.”
For its part, the Nanterre prosecutor's office once again felt that the complainant was inadmissible to act, especially as a guardianship judge in recent days refused to entitle her application to open a judicial protection proceeding for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to proceed in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place,” said prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial took place on Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' admissibility.
Managing revolution or an end to economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees, reminds the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it used to be, to impose on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put market conquest strategies to the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from the factors of customer preferences comes back regularly!
Employee demobilization can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the part of a much more general phenomenon that affects the executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously jeopardizes the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, moreover, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "demands from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires employees to make a commitment that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
That is why we call for a management revolution that would be to put employees at the center of business concerns as well as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – incite this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- Firstly because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure eventually, after many detours, comes to do priority... what it has always done!
Then, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
They come from major engineering schools and have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to manage the "levards" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr supports leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, inadapted to today's world.
Identifying and measuring mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes adopting a finalistic view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means of realizing part of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only the studies derived from the Onctional Motive Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to realize their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "on the spot".
They thus create a ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: “just war” is worth praise to Obama
The U.S. right-wing party welcomed the speech delivered the day before in Oslo by Barack Obama, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of “just war” against U.S. enemies.
Conservatives, who failed to award Mr. Obama the award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Ms. Palin, a member of the Right Wing of the Republican Party, to the daily USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in her recently published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing in my opinion that the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I found the speech to be really good, the former Chairman of the House of Representatives congratulated him, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this entirely historic speech, said Gingrich, questioned on the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former elected, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen “a left-wing president” remind members of the Nobel Committee “that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist.”
For Michael Gerson, former George W. Bush pen converted columnist at the Washington Post, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world” as “he always does it,” he “has spoken like an American president,” reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN ambassador John Bolton, called the speech “tenne, bulged and uninspired” on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed that Barack Obama justified the use of force.
When war is enveloped in the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The center-left press, however, remained praising in the spot of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while still thinking that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Mr. Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should be used as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," California's daily newspaper said.
Obama “has delivered the right speech,” the New York Times said, deeming it “both dark and edifying.”
Roaders: Three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employer organization to remain until the end, reached an agreement Friday night that ends the strike order and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday night, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau "rejoiced" on the agreement after several negotiations, which began Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to quickly sign the text of agreement in the late morning.
And this even if three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked the door.
But it took even more than six hours from a meeting started at 11:00 for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 18:00.
The conflict "would have been very harmful to businesses" and "was to be afraid that it would disrupt the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wages, "we increase from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It’s not much, but we start from a very far distance, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we are going to give our militants the order that there are no blockages, no blockages of the refueling centers.
But we can still have a few recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed “a good deal,” although it was “difficult to grant increases in high wages given international competition.”
According to him, the increases will be around 170 euros per month for low wages and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to a "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a revaluation of travel expenses of 3%, and the keeping of general states of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will enable, inter alia, to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a €100 million decrease in employer charges" was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 amendment finance bill voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote “in the same term.”
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply firstly to companies that are members of this organization, and secondly to the entire profession, in case of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
The opposition of employer organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR has denounced a "dude market" because the €100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset a part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport compelled us to negotiate urgently, not at the conclusion of a shared analysis, but not to upset the turkey eaters of next Eve, the Unostra said.
For the Other, the agreement risks "to dig the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A, the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and the management of the RATP left them on their hunger as to their claim for a premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, for this important Christmas shopping weekend, there will be trains only between 10:00 and 20:00, with one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
The interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which awaits 200,000 customers each day, were pleased that "RATP is making efforts to serve the major stores".
The RER Crossing the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains traveled at peak hours, and almost no rows in hollow hours, as expected.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, as the French had organized themselves.
Thus, in the early morning, the resort of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially because of the absence of college students and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, said he got up "one hour and thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive on time."
The Saint-Lazare railway station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned to coach officers and law enforcement forces.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare railway station to reach the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "mayor" by the unions, of a meeting with the management Friday afternoon.
The Director of the RERs proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a due premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals in parentheses, the CGT outraged, emphasizing that the management "was not failed to solve a problem while the road passengers and the SNCF have done it".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of the profession's exercise," the RATP said.
This also led the unions to say that the company was "laughing at weekend users."
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in the interests of calming."
The conflict threatens to expand to RER B on Tuesday, following the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions request a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line per million daily travellers.
The drivers of RER, all in the second part of their career, reach from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros bonuses, for delayed hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, a decision heavy of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by manifestations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended hands to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end a 25-year conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "foyer of activities detrimental to the state's independence and indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kiliç told the press after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party’s leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity to Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation of party property by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without labels.
The decision follows a proceeding launched in 2007 by Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party, however, assures that it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to reinforce its rights, trying to blur Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders claimed that dissolution could lead to an increase in tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous protests against PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan’s detention conditions have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the large city in the south-east, mostly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones with fronds.
A hundred people also protested in Istanbul.
Following the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen despair.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total blurring of the democratic openness launched by the government, political analyst Ahmet Insel commented.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road unblasting and sandblasting service (FES) states that it is not to bother citizens.
This is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to master them well.
And according to the meteorologists, this might be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles are ready to tackle snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow over the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, large sanding vehicles travel 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes high traffic streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as Atzelbergstraße.
FES officers start their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road should be salted with a road foundation that adhers well, within a maximum of 3 hours of time.
This is why the FES service begins at 3 a.m. "so that roads are cleared when daily migration traffic begins".
When it gets harder, it’s when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the road clearance and sandblasting service, "because no driver is willing to let the salting vehicles pass."
Then, if it doesn't snow, we take care of access roads and service roads - like the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows well that this always gives rise to some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team sets out to clear priority areas considered dangerous and passages.
As for bicycle tracks, FES services are generally unable to deal with them.
Mr. Brauburger states that there is a special service in Frankfurt which is responsible for monitoring the status of the bridges between 22 hours and 4:30 a.m.
As the ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
It is also possible that the police appeal to this special snack service in need.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long for 1.50 meters tall, its back limbs were powerful, its skull was elongated with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws, and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine reports, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, the Pangea, and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa lights up the evolution of the first dinosaurs on a new day.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship links, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team tells that sometimes they could find a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories regarding the early evolution of dinosaurs.
Researchers named it Tawa after the word of the Hopi Indians for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is a quite exceptional discovery: Dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all experts in paleontology share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he states that it can confirm certain theories regarding the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, when the saurians were divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropodes (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor later appeared and from which descend the birds, the sauropodes, quad-footed at the long neck, and those related to them and the herbivores which are part of the ornithisch.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropodes.
This species presents an interesting report of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found clues that suggest that the Tawa hallae possessed small airbags in its bones at the level of the skull, just like the birds that are the descendants of the theropodes.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropodes with small airbags in its bones.
Since the relative lineage of the huge sauropodes also possessed airbags and a light frame, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
Therefore, the three major lines of evolution divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. all the emerging lands that formed the supercontinent Pangea.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropodes that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor that would have migrated, the researchers advance.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
Of course, there are some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the Silesaur, who lived in today's Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give an erroneous view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era while they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, still remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of current crocodiles and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread across the planet thus encouraging the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction that dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or then, the dinosaurs were better suited and thus they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favorite meteorite for the flourishing of a group of animals that had also developed during the Trias and that since then was in the shadow: they were mammals.
Vienna’s solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are those of teachers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino at J.W. Goethe University of Frankfurt is causing waves across the globe.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University and other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America expressed their solidarity with the students protesting at the Westend Campus.
In a statement in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police requested by the university's steering committee.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by striking students and teachers after walls and works of art were shredded with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories believe that the degradations did not justify "so violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own classes."
Evacuation represents an "unacceptable infringement" of freedom of research and teaching.
Focusing exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize the protest" and attempts to forget the reasons for the mobilization.
The University's Steering Committee thus evaded the debates that would be indispensable.
Courses require that criminal prosecutions be immediately suspended.
The majority of occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The youth of the Verdi service union and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are just the legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional youth secretary of the Verdi trade union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action and cause for the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the places is totally unacceptable, she told Wiesbaden regional parliament last Thursday during the television show Current Hour.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of the SPD opposition, the Greens and the Left (the Left) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize protests, said Janine Wissler of the party La Gauche (Link)
Instead of thinking about the students’ arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has filed a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of the police intervention.
The new Silicon Valley
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of search for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from central Moscow, the town has a reputation for being the Soviet Silicon Valley.
Important sites of production and research in micro- and nanoelectronics are installed there.
As early as September 2008, Zelenograd’s representatives established links with Riedberg, the place of the Francoforte sciences – with the academic institutes and societies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives from Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of close collaboration".
The signatories were Deputy Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose highlight is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will enable FIZ companies to enter the rapidly expanding Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
There are the Moscow Institute of Electrotechnics, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be high enough.
For its supporters, it is nothing less than “new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for about a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
The headline railway stations, with lanes ending in the middle of the city, had a reputation at the time for being the relics of 19th-century transportation technology that made the effect of modern rail traffic braking as it used to take a lot of time to move the locomotives from the back to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
That is why the stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Magistrale railway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
Realization of the S21 project is really going to start, although the visions of the 1980s have long been unreasonable with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, headline railway stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with motorways and car-pilot at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now launched next to the new route of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have taken over.
The railway company is of the part because, it is the taxpayer who makes the expenses of the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the federal republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urbanistic point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
You get an urban space that – if you believe the computer-generated planner graphics – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the section's enlargement are designed for trafficking of people that was attributed - and it is typical of the 1980s - to enormous growth.
At the time there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on increasing goods traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
But the new trail, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed into the Swabian project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion is more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade that money will be missing for other junction and bottleneck points in the network.
The Ministry of Transport list lists sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhine valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built slowly.
It would be very urgent here to press thoroughly on the mushroom.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking hoop.
The route of the Rhine Valley is on the way to become the bottleneck of international goods traffic, in the heart of Europe.
The government examines the judgment of the airport
At the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Government of the Land referred to the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night air flights.
Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to legally review the judgment of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had in a written document justified that the Land should adapt the regulations concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the project to build the northwest Frankfurt Airport landing track would be carried out.
The permission to land for 17 aircraft between 11 a.m. and 5 a.m., as the government of the Land envisages, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens from night air disturbances.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wants to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment.
The opposition criticized this deadline and tried to put pressure on the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal of Leipzig.
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections, which consisted of banning night flights, otherwise this would be deemed a total breach of a given word.
It is damn difficult to be allowed to keep his word, Green leader Tarek al-Wazir said, referring to the FDP’s electoral slogan “We keep our promises.”
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the government of the Land attempts to authorize night-time flights by using "avocacy and robbery".
It takes time to conduct a precise legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a “fast first impression.”
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition regarding the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. banks reimbursed aid
The big U.S. banks, severely affected by the crisis, are breaking their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully reimbursed the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
CNBC reported that Citigroup was also considering reimbursing the aid received.
Banking institutions seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the amounts, such as limiting the bonuses awarded to leaders and settling higher fees.
Bank of America launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors, which brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The remainder of the sum comes from the bank's cashiers which are well filled through the sale of several branches in other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, Chief Executive Officer of Bank of America, expressed his thanks to U.S. taxpayers: the capital injection helped considerably to overcome a difficult time.
The bank assumed its capabilities by buying out investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
Citigroup is also considering procuring money on the financial markets in order to free itself from state guardianship.
The U.S. bank could launch a capital increase of $20 billion as early as Thursday, CNBC reported citing the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley reimbursed the public funds they had received.
Accelerated elections
Eventually, everything went faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin editorial of ZDF, was the big favorite.
The channel, however, did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a willingness not to harm ZDF steward Markus Schächter further in case the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of nine of the Commission members out of 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the closure of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract by five years, but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council voted in favour of Brender's recruitment, and seven others voted against, with Brender's resignation by vote being a significant but predictable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, that it would not want to bring Brender back to his position.
It was Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly regarded editor-in-chief by invoking that the listening rate of ZDF's information broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, alleging the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But that would have helped nothing.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and the Romanesque languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rheinland-Palatinate radio station) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF first for the news magazine "aujourd-journal" (today's newspaper).
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant editor-in-chief of the period; then correspondent to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bi-monthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the redaction.
After Brender’s disgrace, while Brender had just been elected Journalist of the Year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent in the Board of Directors, Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the steward's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to call for the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor, had skillfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by criticizing the commission vehemently in his decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as Left Liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: during a meeting between Ministers and delegates of the Rectors Conference, an agreement was developed stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of exams: a single exam should allow the study module chosen to be closed.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organize more flexible common structural prescriptions for the Bachelor and Master courses.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulations from one state to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June last year, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have constantly put in their mouths the fashionable expression: "studyability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The accreditation board has decided to considerably reduce the number of certain exams: "Each module must normally be able to be completed by a single examination," reads a thirty-page document on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of exams, we should be able to stop slippage, which significantly damaged the studyability.
Furthermore, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organization of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if one can not avoid this feeling of choking that is sometimes felt in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and room for manoeuvre necessary to enable and promote personal initiative."
The new regulations will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that only in 2015 will all cycles have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation boards created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to burden the agencies so that the programs were not too loaded and the exam regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher schools have already agreed with their regional departments to take appropriate action.
Thus far, Rhineland-Palatinate is the only state to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs and strengthen pedagogical counselling offices as well as exam offices and the international relations service.
The Länder and universities are planning a budget of €10 million.
In early 2010, the government wishes to file an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete your studies.
The organization of studies must be more flexible, the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Masters must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles will have to be examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the issue of the conditions for study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated but criticism was heard.
The Federal President of the Socialist Student Union said that he would like the organization of educational policy not to take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and rectors of universities.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as individuals concerned should be able to speak a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of the students is very useful to us," she said Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for each Bachelor graduate to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, a member of the GEW steering board, also asks that the Länder ensure that today’s Bachelor students, that there will be enough places tomorrow for master’s studies and as good studies conditions as possible.
The Länder therefore need to hire more teachers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of easing access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words “Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control...” that a work by the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematises in bribes of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arriving in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first teacher of German and English in Bucharest and subsequently director of collection at a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the very coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and since 2002 he is director of the Hesse Literary Forum at the artist's house of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirror distorting of your Securitate records".
Visiblely destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Roman writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the political police Securitate.
Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The recruitment tests began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, “so someone who didn’t know enough how to withstand the Securitate intimidation tests.”
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honour of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary dismemberments with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors originating in Romania is shaken by a case that clearly shows the abyss and bass of a political system, based on police surveillance and pioneering.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He was able to get him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the audience was unexpected, however, the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian intelligence services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for Securitate spies who wrote Herta Müller in July in the newspaper Die Zeit, after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have been speculating and sometimes guessing what real names were last hiding the loan names Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been constantly counteracted and braked in past years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was established to work on the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (CNSAS), but the return of files has rather dragged away since then.
There has been a law in place since 2005 that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large, is confirmed by the interview of a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any genes, under the cover of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many inevitable issues are associated with the Söllner case as it happens so often in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who was robbed? The weighted reaction of the auditors, to Söllner's confession, is hopeful that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it is more than a footnote.
Challenges in the Champions League
There was the impression that a representative was arriving there, pulled four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross climbed at midnight less a quarter in a Mercedes Class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier's hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, allowed himself to be driven into the city that was still alien to him.
Otherwise our fifty-year-old could have taken the wheel himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and wasn’t drunk of happiness either.
He had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because it was now that it was about to begin.
The words of the Swiss who had just entered three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not be blinded by success. This will be a brutal fight not to fall back".
“The big work” awaits us on Sunday.
Here, it is about repeating the results of the Champions League in Mainz on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that reappeared after the three expeditive goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Lottery
The eighth final of the Champions League (match going 16./17. + 23./24 February/return match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on December 18 in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's entry into office was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in the lucky one, who had conveyed to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, unmistakable motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them to focus on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "Plumber of Souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so well but no longer made any effects with Caregiver Babbel.
He triggered some magic, admitted Jens Lehmann - Babbel's supporter - "In football, when there is a new impulse, sometimes things happen that would never have been thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of breaks for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" noted by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the new leader's working method: "It's someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
But apparently Babbel missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs toughness.
Just like Gross, players and managers do not overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They also won in Glasgow before four days later having a bad wake-up at Leverkusen with 0:4, Khedira objected.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but had others that were still far away.
We haven't gone through the difficult course yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home victory in three months, is due to the weekend events that a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann bounced just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt would counteract, in response to Lehmann's acute criticism.
He accused the direction of style weakness and said it had decided to change coach under the pressure of puberty fans.
Lehmann also considered it a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day after the games was removed from him.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness” and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life for these two forty-year-olds.
In all casts, they agreed on everything else, that is to say that without the previous work of the group by the coach replaced, strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were “for a great deal in success,” Heldt and Lehmann played in choir – and even the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the challenger verbally and gesturally to the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title as world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
At the unanimity of the judges, he decided on the issues.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion won a single-point victory against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time, Klitschko honourably defends his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
The Ukrainian had previously won the title of World Champion of the WBO and WBC federations twice.
Unfortunately, he did not succeed in the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, has twice confessed his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th battle.
In the Berne Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mostly wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of his 2.02 meters, by his opposite left.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's hits, thus preventing Klitschko from putting his dangerous right against him into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his strokes rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him a “bad zombie” who “is not really capable.”
During Friday's weighing, the champion couldn't help but cause Johnson to drop his sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko re-established in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a break of nearly four years, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without fighting.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a shot in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His survey is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujev - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotional company is considering now playing this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz Affair
Frontal attack of the opposition: the leader of the Greens parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the Left (Left) parties are asking the chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a falsehood" about the deadly strike of two tankers last September, Greens' parliamentary group leader Jürgen Trittin said Saturday during the news broadcast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the 8 pm newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in substance, the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the strike was in reality not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. airstrike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to proceed as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party, Renate Künast, are of the view that Angela Merkel should make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government and whether the Chancellery, the military and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman strongly rejected these criticisms.
The chancellory has in no way influenced the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were increasing voices to express doubtful reasons for the removal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had provided to Guttenberg about the attack on tankers was both accurate and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and concealed some embarrassing details from the Minister.
In the context of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page Colonel Klein document and a military police report.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert had meanwhile asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not obtained an answer.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not wish to comment on these accusations and referred to the Federal Parliament’s investigative committee that was to be set up on Wednesday to bring light on the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in psychic patients, or under the effect of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our dark rooms, we can give ourselves unhindered to the craziest dreams and fantasies.
However, anyone who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being mad or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices appear not only in psychic patients or under the effect of drugs.
It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but which sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A state of conscious awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases this is called visions, in the worst of madness.
But even though the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the secondary states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitting substances in the brain - first of all dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts manifest very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The terrestrial force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and physicians have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, saw in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it."
It's in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
His body is in two dimensions with crisp colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over it, it flies down the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him winged creatures of devil, crimping, his mouth bleeding, showing his teeth.
They pursue him, kick him with heavy flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body.
Tonituring, evil, screaming voices coming out of the walls and radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls out two cables from his stereo chain, in fact a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
It climbs on a baffle and runs the loop around the neck.
He's jumping.
The loop is detached.
Let it be a lesson for you, shout the voices in a choir to rip off his tympan, "Go to a clinic and get healed!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is two years old, the first is nearly 20 years old.
It was triggered by LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is maniac-depressive, he takes medications for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lifetime; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, those affected can no longer distinguish between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which can cause them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relationship madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry at the CHU in Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the middle of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act actively on them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
In general, they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis, is fundamentally preserved.”
Delirant thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the living takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain makes these kinds of cabriolets, is still a mystery for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers assume that those affected have minor brain injury.
Neural maturation of the brain is assumed to be disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is how the neuronal system anomaly occurs and also the fact that it does not manifest for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain warms.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy very expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a question of perspective.
For ten years, Kasten has gathered reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The unreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations are well part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or cranial trauma.
It is surprising to note that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are subject to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently retained; when our brain warms up, but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, grief of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of the participants acknowledged having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lifetime.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, she lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and went to high school.
A girl who does everything normal in reality.
If there weren't the images and the voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, speaks to him.
When she answered, her comrades looked at her, astonished – no one else saw or heard this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
He can even perceive his presence momentarily.
It's a pleasant feeling, she finds this friendly young man.
“Am I crazy?” she sometimes wonders.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and they will disappear again.
At night, apparitions are usually scary.
Visions are often heavy.
When she is in class, she happens to be unable to attend the class because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is apparently explaining equations on the table.
At night, apparitions are usually scary.
When, in the darkness of her bedroom, she awaits sleep that comes too rarely and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or dreaming already, whether the images she sees, the grimming faces or the girl with bloody slits on her arms and legs are in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she cries to these creatures.
She doesn't tell her parents or friends about it, they would think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her grade last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came in contact with psychologist Kasten on the internet she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulations, the chance is great that they will have hallucinations after a while.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so it makes sure there's some animation.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of other children when she was young and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at age 13 that the man she called dad, since she was aged to think, was not her real father.
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to distinguish between illusion and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychoses.
Unlike schizophrenes, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That’s why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, we unfortunately quickly tend to take imaginary experiments for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful illness but also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oniroid form of experience, a particular form of the change in consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
Oniroid consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully aware, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change is taking place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, it is an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity which is given to us men not to sink into the nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zurichian Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of Heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time his conscious departs for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is doomed to remain immobile in reanimation.
Claussen plunges into a world that he has created, visiting foreign places, traveling in time. He sees himself as an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who made blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek motorcyclist who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It completely absorbs into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are of extreme clarity and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a standby state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Kasten summarizes, "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen as CEO of Burda Editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told Spiegel newspaper.
The holding must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to join society, Hubert Burda, 69, told the Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
We will also have to see if they are able to do so.
You cannot impose your children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the ability to take care of them.
This would destroy the children as well as the company.
Burda announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the position of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Subsequently he took care of the Treasury sector, that is to say he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the head of marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus, for the first time, it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17, respectively, his son Felix, now 42, died a few years ago.
The nomination of Kallen also serves to make the link for the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda states that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always occurred in families that have been driven by a bulimia of capital, which have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never dreamed of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely don't see myself in the role of the country's teacher as Springer could be and I don't intend to be part of these international leagues like the Time, these companies have taken much too much importance.
Complete Beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at hand.
This is the objective that seems to have set El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious signs such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and cosmetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a dietary radius, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different types.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relax zone to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and to relax with a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 are divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative face, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibrant platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "coaches" that guide the footsteps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to perform our exercise program correctly.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warming and stretching) are enough to get all the muscles of the body to work.
And, if after making our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the keywords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various decollets
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to fit our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very recommended.
Endesa and Barcelona, get the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona Municipality, has created the "Oficina LIVE".
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Workshop" will define and coordinate the roadmap for the installation of electric cars in the city and establish agreements on mobility, conducting steps, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transportation of the future.
3 “Electrical Cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joining the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is involved in promoting electric cars.
The company takes part in European standardization groups and has a set of complementary projects ongoing such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero envisions “a future of tranquility” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, envisions a “future of tranquility” for the Spanish automotive industry which, he recalled, is the country’s main export sector.
During the presentation of the President's Economic Report for 2009, Zapatero recalled the steps taken by the executive over the course of the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, the closure of some of our main production sites,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envision a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (IPA), has allocated €800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which have mobilized an investment of over €3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized governmental demand-support measures, referring to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced average emissions from new vehicles marketed on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collection cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collection Cars, a meeting space for professionals and enthusiasts of the world of engineering.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can we find motorcycles and collection cars there, but we will also find at ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, in pavilion exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, auto sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, auto sales and catering, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist at Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor fitness test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Suitability tests with collection cars and motorcycles will also take place on a circuit outside the exhibition centre.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A Sustainable Sports Spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated the engine shut-off and start-up system, called i-Stop, on the Mazda3, a device that, at least for now, is only available on the 150-horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good score it has achieved as a whole.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving post, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of that of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to this, there is a large chest of regular shapes.
The automatic engine shut-off and start-up system, at least for now, is only available on the two-litre and 150-horsepower gasoline engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the Mazda3s are the most demanding diesel models, those who do not travel a large number of kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with gasoline engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its mastered fuel consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of series elements.
Among the standard equipment, the track change wizard (RVM) which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the inner photosensitive mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the bluetooth audio, as well as the roues.
Furthermore, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements adaptive bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which ranges between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this substantial amount, the Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.

The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to view your email, without offering the possibility of even seeing certain type of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine designated him as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone’s data subscription.
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter and the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandbrother, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, approximately 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or to desperately search for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult its mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly appealing and it should work for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely noticeable effect.
Outside of your country of origin, we are hesitant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it’s always curious that it’s called Fon while it doesn’t have Wifi) offers this type of rates, means that operators start thinking differently and studying different proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no gallery.
This is a connected device and is paid on purchase and not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a life-access purchase option as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it's a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to Barack Obama's office in the US presidency in a dress and coat of that color, she, in fact, chose the same to accompany him in the second moment, undoubtedly, the most important of her life: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on these two occasions: besides their resembling color, a yellow drawing to the green with shiny reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So that at first glance, it seems that the First Lady of the United States followed the Princess of Asturias and chose to wear the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are carved makes them very different.
If it was a thick lace for taking office, on the other hand, she wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: medium-heeled green shoes for the first time, and a similar, but golden model, this time.
The hair has also changed: the hair is now lifted while she was wearing them released the previous time.
75% of working mothers had professional problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women from younger generations who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fertility and professional career of women in Spain", conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt: 75% of working mothers saw their careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of couple life and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of employment occupied.
Those who do not have activity outside the home, work part-time, or have an unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier, and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, push back entry into couple life and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 for women working in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable work needed more time in their lives to obtain it, which led them to push back union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised largely influences maternity, but less the start date of common life,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that deepens the gap in the age of marriage of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who completed elementary and higher studies were mothers for the first time at an average of 25.1 and 32.1 years respectively.
“Another discretion also appears among women, depending on their level of study.
While those who have completed elementary studies marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child,” said Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several of the brand’s products, singing the universal motto “Because I’m worth it well.”
The protagonist of Happy Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities listed at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
In men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline’s companion in Lost).
British Fashion Prices
The British have a lot to say in the world of fashion.
Its greatest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual award ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Ace Poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
It does not do so according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither fear nor illumination.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an emotional invitation to reads and re-reads.
I'll leave you a few moments here.
“In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the same that I felt without naming it: pleasure against funeral destiny, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.”
As Samuel Beckett wrote, “Nhilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling, meaningless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him.”
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which consisted of reaching heaven through the path of perdition.”
About James Joyce: “The Ulisse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach, one of the eight thousand-metre summits of universal literature, which must be climbed by the northern face, on which the best mountaineers still and always drop.”
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landlord of the county and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the demented cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to bring his echo to the depths of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did so in the fleeing of himself and invoking posterity with a violent discourse to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: “One day she knelt down and prayed, ‘God, beloved, I beg you to stop writing like a woman.’”
Spenser's worms were engraved on his tomb: "Sleep after effort, after storm port, rest after war, after life, tired death rejuvenates."
Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband normally accepted that she should tell her that Edward VII was watching her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent exceeded madness.
On Pío Baroja: “What did Martín-Santos do but try to hide Joyce at Baroja?
What does Benet try but to shoot Baroja by Faulkner?
What did it do except to aspire to the glory of this man so that he can serve him as a pedestal?”
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a melee, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assessed her two kicks that left the dog severely wounded.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what it is fun to assault for free a small defenseless animal that, in addition, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who walked quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energetic attacking an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog has groaned all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint with the neighborhood police station even though we doubt that this is very useful and to not touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly killers were Spanish.
The indignation led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with young people so they find it fun to abus a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people went.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for wearing helmets
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin said the campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which “goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever-safer products” and stated that it contributed to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new campaign to encourage the wearing of two-wheel helmets, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, to ensure the widest dissemination.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop ever-safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are growing
After almost two years, the light commercial vehicle market starts to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employer union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the reference for comparison in November 2008 was particularly poor, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the turnover in the last month, the number of registrations accumulated during these 11 months is 40% below that of the previous year.
Since January, all vehicles that fall into the light commercial vehicle category (derived from passenger cars, pickups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) have been sold 95,853.
However, the large clouds that affect their demand most have not dissipated, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which in nearly 100% of cases pay through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank credits, other factors such as increased unemployment rates or the persistence of poor economic conditions need to be added.
Faced with this situation and unlike passenger vehicles, the purchase aid for the 2000E has served little.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, can also benefit from this, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it was again recalled the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealership association expects a 2010 year similar to that ending, for which it calculates a decline in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As it happened with the ABS brake anti-lock system and as it will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory for newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a lack period was set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, through its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many back shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always keep the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by Bosch car components manufacturer, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken full advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revenge, demands the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: one in four disasters with injuries is estimated to be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, through a radar or camera, detects obstacles and prevents the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he/she assists him/her by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragossa) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched in the first week of April – probably on the 8th –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that he will need more time to complete the plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that every point of the plan has been approved in advance by the relevant party.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
At GM, however, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab is expected to be made in the coming days.
It is therefore no surprise that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the application of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is becoming more important.
In the event that there would be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
The Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to lose weight by nothing less than 80 pounds, leaving the scale at only 1,275 pounds.
This led them to avoid, first of all, the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilograms, to use aluminium doors like those of the GT3, 15 kilograms less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilograms, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 kilograms, 7 kilograms of gained, and 12 kilograms of sports.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, thus gaining another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilogram.
Although the model also exists with the double clutch PDK box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox model, mainly on California’s secondary network roads, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we had tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in turns, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of heating his muscles at low speed for the time it takes, until we asked him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she will do it with surgical accuracy.
Engine sound at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that modifies the roaring of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is abrupt, whether it's down or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road covering we traveled with the Boyxster Spyder was fairly damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely made a note of presence throughout the journey, while on some turns we found ice cream in the early morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultralight car, one of the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be put on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, Coco Cocoon line icon and occasional starlette of the house parades, the singer displays her bad girl face with as much contentment as her Chanel bags.
More than a “Bad Girl” or “It Girl,” it’s a “Bag Girl.”
Baskonia wins in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the hard ground of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the Dusko Ivanovic team, thus being at the top of its group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight three-point baskets was the best of its team (29 evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, which took the advantage from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter indicated that they had jumped on Israeli ground with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was received by acclamations and applause back to his former home, to increase their advantage at break (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be noticed as the best player in his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "minus six" rating already predicted that this night was not going to be the best of Brazil.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from that, and the Avala team wanted to remind Vitoria that we didn't win so easily on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to enter the match.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the yellows taking advantage over the bright (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to chain a few skillful actions to take air, and it was at this point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun-67 emerged that, with three straight-three baskets and the help of English and Ribas, gave the counter a reassuring score to the third (54-67).
Avala's team went out to play the whole game for all during the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they wouldn't let anyone let them take what they had deserved during the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic players did not rush, defend well, and although the Israelis came closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped in Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent the Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost noisy in Greece against the Olympiacos and gave him the head of Group B of the Euroleague, in a match marked by the absences of players of the Unicaja, especially in the home game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or the scale of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, allowed the Andalusians to dream, an aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two from leader Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the indoor game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams resulted in the disqualification of the two.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both sides, while the injury exit of English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal mistakes were weighing on the Unicaja.
The domestic players and the Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage, in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible lift
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, showed itself superior and even managed to equal the difference of the match disputed in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, making the head of the group chancelling.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, wounded during the match.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57 at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos showed relentless when the players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid from your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would earn based on their profile, thanks to a new app from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of real estate, jobs and vehicle ads in Spain.
The tool "How much should you be paid?" calculates users' salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available by Trovit in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you need to register your profession, years of experience, age and the city where you want to work.
For a week, the search engine has detected that as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels poorly paid,” said Albert Ribera, the product manager of Trovit.
According to the data Trovit has from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spaniards are the least paid.
A British computer programmer collects 45,226 gross euros per year and a French one, 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver collects 34,247 gross euros annually in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net annually, followed by that of seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are drivers, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a departure date for Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president must abandon the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of affairs with the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, after his term, he must look for another destination."
The channel also quoted the former mandatary, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant mark in the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions on an uncertain future by nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt by direct purchasing assets and indirectly by giving abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually completed and, without questioning their non-conformist liquidity policy, start to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB did, with their tender for a year next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reverse of the reduction of risk premiums.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond deviations are rising again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is affected again.
There is once again a flight toward quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the shelters chosen by investors, causing increased differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this instability episode, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened a further downward revision of the Kingdom of Spain's qualification.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad in silenceing the advocates of moral risk, who were again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for global economic policy who had hampered the destructive effects of credit limitation on the destruction of employment, while what should be done is to declare a new day of action thanks to it.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the Emirates to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be absolutely irrational if Ecofin saved Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allowed a member country of the euro area to fail to meet its commitments.
What makes sense, on the other hand, is that Ecofin has incited the Greek government to transparency and makes its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of normalization of the transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt deviations increase to the extent of European corporate bonds, we don't have to worry.
If European gaps were to decrease and our gaps continued to increase, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators require most study services to anticipate their relaunch models and to revise their 2011 forecasts upwards, with in addition the OECD and the European Commission, which return to charge with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it doesn't have much hope for their expectations.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the moment "cautiousness is the mother of security".
Connected sectors
Iberdrola President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned in front of the subcommittee, eight-closes.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest €50,000 million until 2020 and €60,000 million more between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants in operation today remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to 60,000 million, but 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but rather to distribution networks and international interconnections.
As of 2020, the issue will change, and the power will need to be increased.
Its bet focuses on both gas and coal power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, most importantly, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW more are needed, along with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not wish to attack the royal decree to encourage national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is a “clear, long-term bet” in this sense, despite “temporary” measures, as Iberdrola’s president called them.
In any case, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are long-term, should begin to be taken because they take some time to reach their maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus’ handling market in ten airports
Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance anticipates an investment of 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to conduct research on energy efficiency on highways and at airports.
Acciona disputes its first motorway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession motorway in Australia, a market on which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site at stake is a tunnel estimated at $1,700 million in Australia (approximately $1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A five-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway dealer.
The city’s town hall hopes to have it available by the end of 2014.
After choosing public/private collaboration (PPP) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the projected investment amounts to $1,700 million in Australia (approximately $1,047 million) and in the last phase three consortiums compete, with a significant presence of European manufacturers.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish smooth company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest manufacturers in Australia, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European underground works specialists.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatizations, but entering it is a major difficulty, other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona rely on a geographical area of the highest importance for the sector, in which it already has a wide presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and runs the group of companies responsible for building and managing the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the infrastructure construction and management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and Northern Link, is called to connect the Toowong West Highway with the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove by 4 kilometers of tunnel, which is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the tender will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will comprise twice two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make great fruitful Hochtief, who yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national fiber optic broadband network.
This intervention will enable 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has ceded the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in Brisbane City, which has not yet started and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC awards a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, is awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after being charged with the expansion of the tunnel in Bosruck, Austria, for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the construction site is scheduled for early 2010 and it will take 32 months to be completed.
Mrs. Rushmore gets awarded Renfe's advertising
Renfe entrusted advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore, for a budget of around three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
Mrs. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that participated in the bidding organized by Renfe, four of which were finalists, including TBWA, who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator imposed a fine of €63 million on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programs on the sidelines of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state undertaking, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore recurrent.
A shop of apps
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone subsidiary followed the follow-up of other operators and opened an Internet app store, with the aim of increasing revenue that does not come from voice transmission.
Initially, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 before it arrives in other countries like Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has earned 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Indeed, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona earned 467.4 million, placing them in the third and fifth places of the clubs that pocked the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
Indeed, the competition allocated €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the tournament was created, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to earn the most money for its participation, and the only, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, even though they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money returned by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the allocation of money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn $1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (of which Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who succeeded in participating received 3.8 million only to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a winning bonus (€800,000) and equal bonus (€400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighths of the final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarterfinal receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive 4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which are devoted 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats.
The previous year's champion wins 40% of the allocated money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other game will be paid depending on the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa Group listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a Public Acquisition Offer (OPA) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be paid out in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, Sos’ shares ended at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa’s offer values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditioned by the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders a 15-day deadline to indicate their interest in selling the securities.
The CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would be 611.7 million, while Sos' capital would be 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues the restructuring of his management.
In an attempt to stay outside of possible offers for purchases and courts from her former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to occupy a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will be directly dependent on the chairman of the group.
And it is not free of controversy, since the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new diversions of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to Salazars, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday to the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing their destination.
The CNMV authorizes the exclusion OPA of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion OPA presented by Inversa Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body explained that it was authorizing this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with current standards and that it considered the contents of the explanatory sheet to be "sufficient" following the amendments implemented on December 2.
The CNMV specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were immobilized and could in no way be transferred before the offer was finalized, which he indicated had been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars who have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of pieces and labor time can be a long and complex work.
Hand calculating the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workforce can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why nearly 100% of experts use these types of systems.
Service and solutions providers for claim assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by manufacturers, and then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, so that over the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes into the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard work, because you have to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and register its price.
In addition, a “smart” graphical image of each model can be created to click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If this is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has comprehensive information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about Porsches, for example, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million dollars each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer various products.
The most common application relates to repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing broken parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the full identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is an open-to-professional server on the Internet that bids on vehicles declared wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analysis or knowing common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious disasters for a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of claims, failures or car maintenance.
The GT Assessment Guide is a historic reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, with a turnover of €10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
Solera Group’s global turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3 percent higher than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive €19.1 million, or 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the $1,000 million stock market, now its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been side by side with the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet auction of accidented cars
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of €59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand to the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the opportunity to access a huge international market.
This estimate and sales service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, cash brokers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Currently there are more than 1,500 vendors and 4,000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but, on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating a quote and generating it.
Ease of use is an essential component of these systems, especially in order to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reactive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passengers, 109 off-roads, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, increases or discounts, and then print the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include the estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to make these images in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
