Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about "looking muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion arises from the plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly declared that his group was concerned "that it would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers from outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means cock.
A member of the Wales Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "dissatisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales claimed that his group was "open" to name change, but noted that the jump from MWP pronunciation to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, declares: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be the matter of the members themselves".
The 2017 law of the Government of Wales gave the Assembly of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Parliament of Wales into the Assembly.
On the issue of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Parliament of Wales (or WMP), but the MWP option obtained most of the support in a public consultation.
Apparently, members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could lead to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should send the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disability of Assembly Members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the last word on the question of what should be called when they deliberate on legislation.
Macedonians go to polls to vote for referendum on country name change
The voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was summoned in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the change of name, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells remain silent because of the difficulties of Harlem churches
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.”
He noted that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize differently,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that neighbors go to regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of goods will not last as long as leaders expect and that “before or after, they will return to the starting point.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people that will not help the sanctuaries remaining in the neighborhood.
“The immense majority of people buying apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and, therefore, will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation left in the 30s of the 20th century.
A black worshipping congregation nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took over St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while Father Johnson's parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the carriage.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor to Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the carriage called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
Additionally, expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan said it was the world’s first carriage carriage used by a black musician, Dionysus A. Lind, who left to play the larger Riverside Church carriage carriage, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the parish governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Wounds 13-Year-Old Boy Diving For Lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the day the lobster season opened, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help, so he approached with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited to have captured a lobster, but then he realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten.
,
He had his claviculum broken,” observed Hammel when he reached the boy.
“I greeted everyone to come out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablad, to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans drive UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specialized in the hallways of its style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2800 trillion and growing compared to falling sales in fashion and homeware, the largest beauty halls will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they successfully overcome it, will be done the same in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets seeks ways to use the shelves space that used to be destined for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, more space will be given to existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanding by younger customers.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop will test its concessions at two Sainsbury’s establishments, the first newly opened in Croydon, southern London, last week. The second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift to the daily purchase of small amounts of food at local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, has said the stores will look more and more like malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount establishments offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points in hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted grocery sales and further profitableised these acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to divide the revenue from pharmaceutical outlets in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical establishments to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and atmosphere of our beauty halls to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff that will be available to provide advice.
Our brand offering is designed to suit all needs, but an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible destination of beauty products, challenging the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones is “furious” after Holly Willoughby breaks a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragon's Den star Peter Jones went "furious" after television host Holly Willoughby broke a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to dedicate to the fashion brand and accessories Truly.
This business had compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has enraged Dragon's Den star Peter Jones by leaving her lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources, Jones was "furious" when the golden girl on television admitted that her new deals, valued at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, didn't leave time to dedicate herself to Truly, her fashion brand and accessories, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was a favorite to double Willoughby’s fortune of about 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source said: "Truly was, by far, Holly's top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her in the next two decades.
His decision to leave left all involved totally amazed.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse full of goods at Marlow’s headquarters, ready-made products for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and for ten years have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that yesterday night "there was no talk of business issues."
A difficult conversation "and then we fall in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "poor presidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump commented with his ridiculous voice as a “newsmaker.”
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting him again after Trump commended the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Nevertheless, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s leading diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see a “adequate response” from the U.S. to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump’s perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his gathering.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have a fantastic relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: an end to missile testing, helping to release hostages and bringing the remains of American soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about relationships with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to enter this crowded stadium, we would have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people who were right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to move, a national emergency was not declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates things a little,” explains Ms. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still unsure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide aid.
Given that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is still incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a prior warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, travelling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship in Lombok to care for the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo turned the improvement of Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure into the central axis of his election campaign, and has allocated a lot of money to roads and railway lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr Joko’s administration, which is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes while gangs of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Look at this: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equals the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when the score was 1-0.
He put the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action commanded him above the area and headed towards the upper right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
“I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea was winning 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midpoint made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that move, before turning a regatta near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the midfield.
Then, he made a nice pass into space that took Hazard into the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished throwing the ball into the net of the second post with a kick with the left foot that Liverpool’s Alisson Becker couldn’t stop.
On Wednesday at 3:00 p.m., Liverpool plays against Napoli in the Champions League group stage, taking place at San Paolo Stadium in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea faces Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Number of Indonesian tsunami victims rises to 832
The number of casualties from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country’s emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday that unleashed waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with stabs at Grayson Mews, John Street, which meant the arrest of a 32-year-old man as suspected of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but would encourage anyone who was near Jonh Street in Birkenhead, and who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend to anyone, especially taxi drivers, that they have been able to capture something on dashcam to contact us, as they can have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body has been found is from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who believe they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but police tell him no one can get in or out of the building.
He was perplexed when he discovered what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to return in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the spot in tears.
He keeps repeating "it's terrible."
At two o’clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cord and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cord controlling the floor block.
Anyone who has information is asked to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, registration 247 on September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell statue becomes the last commemorative success for "rewriting history"
Its ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by its fanatic Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestions as “madness” and an “try to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that taking the figure of Oliver Cromwell out of Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclassy of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a proof of the opinion of the nineteenth century and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy to celebrate.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate description, it is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-seventeenth-century conflict has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing a face of that division.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration."
A murderous pig attacks a Chinese cattle farmer
A pig attacked and killed a livestock farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified solely by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a blood-sectioned artery near a well of the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig breeder prepared to inject vaccines to pigs from a puddle in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He appears to travel with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door of a nearby well was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250 kilogram pig had attacked the cattle farmer until death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and broken,” the cousin, whom they address by his surname, “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
Images from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were collecting evidence on the spot.
It seems that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, it is not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously wounded.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing almost 295 pounds stuck a rancher in his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After pigs were eaten to an Oregon rancher in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs aren’t usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They're like kids, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What you have to do is have the right respect for them,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy widespread rainfall in the southwestern U.S.
As planned, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind bursts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane from Sunday at five o’clock in the morning (east time) and was located nearly 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean low pressures are starting to generate, moving eastwards to the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push intense tropical rains northwards, southwestwards of the U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rain collides with the low pressure approaching, there will be widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden flooding, debris flows and possible detachments in the desert.
Heavy tropical rains will cause rainfall of almost 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected between 5 and 10 centimeters in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden flooding with rapidly aggravating conditions may occur.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot at all.
Heavy rains could turn cannons into shaky rivers and storms will cause cracked winds and dust clouds locally.
Low pressures approaching will leave heavy rainfall in specific parts of the southern California coast.
The torrential rains may leave up to almost two centimeters of water, which could cause small streams of debris and make the roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some dispersed tropical chaparrons will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spread in late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, some severe temperature changes in the U.S. could be observed due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes this implies dramatic temperature changes at short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen throughout the central U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a difference of nearly 7 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged heat of the summer will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S. it is expected a warm early October, with widespread temperatures around 26 degrees from the Southern Plain to parts of the north-east.
On Tuesday, temperatures could reach up to 26 degrees, roughly 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high probabilities of higher than average eastern U.S. temperatures during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s appearance
More than 20 million people followed the tearing testimony that Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave on Thursday on six television channels.
Meanwhile, politics continued to stand still and the media interrupted their usual schedule to broadcast Friday’s latest news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that she is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh touched her in a state of drunkenness and that she tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people Nielsen commented on Friday have seen it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Furthermore, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football match of the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose tertulians have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, fuels the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, great interest was still shown.
Flake was the central character of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement reporting that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras captured how protesters screamed at him as he tried to climb an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judicial Commission.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live on CNN, he showed himself down.
“Looking in my face,” said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
And she continued, “You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would tell more in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable television and broadcasting broadcasts broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judicial Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh's candidature to the Senate for vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part because of the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators subsequently, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was fundamental, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to pass Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “making politics” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics with her plan to leave the European Union of “making politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is coming to the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview posted alongside him on the newspaper’s cover, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson insisted on his attack on Chequers’ alleged Brexit plan, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other’s tariffs was “completely absurd.”
Wayde Murder: Police Arrested Dyteon Simpson As Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police note that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA in them, according to WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After interrogating Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been established, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge District Instruction Court published a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of the death had been a gunshot wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, State Police criminalism laboratory, Southern University police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, sports director of LSU, thanked the area’s police forces for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who was more than two meters tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things people always care about,” Wade said.
A volcano throws ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and shakes.
On social media, images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters faced anti-riots while thousands of people participated in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarized referendum on the secession.
A group of hooded separatists whom the riots had cut off threw eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
Clashes also occurred in later hours and police used porras to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independence groups, with messages such as “no forgetting or forgiving,” faced unionist protesters shouting “Live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for mild injuries suffered during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters elected independence by overwhelming majority, although participation was low, as people who were against the secession boycotted the referendum to a large extent.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were wounded last year after police attempted to prevent voting at electoral offices throughout the region, where violent clashes occurred.
Independence groups camped Friday evening to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration went on, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy for being able to vote, but now we’re stuck.”
Despite achieving a vital, though narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been revived by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in preventive detention since late last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested for Raiding a House with a Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly hitting a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, he may have shot the car with a ballaster.
Menga attack gives 1-0 victory to Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by winning the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference, Gary Holt's one-place higher, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard’s haven’t yet achieved any victory outside the home and next Sunday they face the Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points ahead.
Previously, the Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, the Livingston is extending its winning line to six games, and head coach Holt has not yet enjoyed the defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities in front of a sharp visitor
Holt's team had to have gone a step ahead long before scoring, causing all kinds of trouble to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson beat the defense, but failed his attempt in front of the goal. Afterwards, Alan Lithgow got a diverted shot after interning to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of the goal.
The host team contented itself with letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems for visitors with ball-stop plays.
That’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers granted them a free shot and Livingston sought an entry, with a combined play from Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but they couldn’t pass the host’s defense and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite quiet.
That game continued until the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor rejected a kick of Scott Pittman, and Lithgow stayed far from another play from Livingston.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entering, but were always cleared, two penalty requests were rejected, one after a Halkett entry over alternate Glenn Middleton and one by one hand.
"Fabulous" from Livingston (analysis)
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they did an excellent game that continued to exceed the expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and team have barely undergone changes since his ascent, but this is largely due to Holt’s way he has reinforced the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Halkett, the team's captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
Though they had very good moments with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the moves, as they only managed to enter the opposing field once, which is a warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received ambiguous welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police alleged security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came in nearby to see its president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic Accident in Deptford: Cyclist Dies After Colliding with Vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The crash occurred near the crossing of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was attended by the paramedics, but died right there.
The crash occurs after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that fled on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from Saturday's crash site.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six agents wounded after riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation produced in a high-security prison for men, according to the prison management.
The riots began at Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight interns participate and affect a pavilion.
Agents were assisted for mild injuries to the face on site.
A prison service spokesman comments: "Specialized prison staff have been deployed to address the ongoing incident in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
“In our prisons violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be put into the hands of the police and could spend more time in bars.”
Long Lartin prison hosts more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, riot agents were asked to come to the prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the last pick-ups of Hurricane Rosa crossed the desert’s southwest, at risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain in late Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorology Service commented on a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had preserved their state of tropical storm or depression within a radius of 321 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollón Scarp, Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching the 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious issue, part of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to drought conditions currently experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering at least from extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to fall back in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm over Monday afternoon.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in some parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
"Torrential rains are expected between 7 and 15 centimeters from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters," as reported on weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will head north from Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, subsequently moving through Arizona to southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the heavy torrential rain in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora and the southwest of the U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center notes.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden flooding and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspected of a murder attempt after another 16-year-old was found with white weapon wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
Agents have made a call to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the cell phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Voting in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the merciless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of having sexually assaulted her decades ago as teenagers.
Ford also testified in the session on this indictment.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s cunning, quality, and courage.”
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the legalists with the most achievements of our days, a lawyer with an admirable history at the service of the public,” he told his West Virginia fans.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh's nomination when talking about the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
“Five weeks are left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not presenting myself, but it’s a race,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The Senate’s first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior official of the Republican Party’s leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number is on the rise
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that devastated the beaches after a heavy earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters arrived on the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When it was warned yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and didn’t flee immediately, that’s why they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it devastated everything on land," said Nugroho. "The tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Assessment and Application of Technology Agency (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the big earthquake on Friday was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be greater along the 300 km of coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were "completely paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy by itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, you hear a man who was on the top floor of a building warning people that he was on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a water wall hits the coast, carrying buildings and cars ahead.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut off communications in the surroundings of Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities declare, but evacuated people still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for relief tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff have arrived safely and healthy in the city of Palu, where employees have taken refuge under canvases installed in their office garden, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as the aid groups started the disaster assistance gears, some people regretted that extensively experienced collaborators were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a catastrophe at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, Indonesia’s Red Cross spokeswoman.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can begin to provide international aid, but it has not yet happened.”
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the devastating stories that write about natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“For my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the release of the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu competitors, who participated in the festival that was being held on the beach.
However, their messages only showed one checkmark in grey, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves Take $26,750 During ATM Recharge at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers robbed a Brink employee charging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the recreational center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While busy, another man "runned behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for recharge.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the site, but police did not specify the number of involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will begin to be named Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday: “The person previously known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of their appearance on Saturday Night Live, where they are expected to present their new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the creator of the show commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious importance to him.
“I think it’s the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year while talking about the album’s title with radio speaker Big Boy.
"I'm you, it's us, it means us.
It went from being Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad, and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in large or small letters, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Andrés Manuel López Obrador, elected Mexican president, has promised never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised at Plaza Tlatelolco that he “will never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were strengthening throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He claimed that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double I.A. funding.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its research investment in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and I.A. professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come afterwards with announcements concerning I.A. from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become number one in innovation in I A. by 2030.
“Doubling the I.A. research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. We have a look at the next breakthrough in the I.A. field,” Lee says.
Twice the funding means twice the chance that the next big achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China’s leading I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that defeated Othello's best American player. He was subsequently executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee awarded recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would allow to identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China taking academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired seniors from universities to work in I.A.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its initiatives in I.A.
"I think doctors in I.A. should automatically have permanent residence cards," he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at attracting partners from the industrial and academic fields, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Foundation for Science, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that tried to set up a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change their country’s name
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether their name would be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia,” a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their candidacy for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, a majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether the participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper raised the following question: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies like the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported at one afternoon.
However, participation was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters deposited their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Tanevski, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko deposited their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a country name change that would open the way to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament, in Skopie, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and removing chairs in front of tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with a very high head, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide the investment that Macedonia so much needs, whose unemployment rate is above 20%.
“I think the vast majority will be in favor, as more than 80% of citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after depositing his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a “confirmation of our future.”
In a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Policy Research, it was assured that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV from Macedonia revealed that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
If it failed, it would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Look at this: Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero dodges all Brighton’s defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling crashed the Brighton defense in the 2-0 victory that Manchester City won Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a midfield pass at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He avoided a defense before overcoming several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Agüero has some foot problems," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial edge in the Premier League contest.
The goal arrived in the 29th minute.
In that game, Agüero received the ball very far within the territory of Brighton.
He made a nice left flank ball pass for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before driving Sterling towards the second stick.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the network just before getting out of the limits.
The City faces Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to water the Rockies party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer expects to step on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, triumphed against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to the 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still pursue their first division title.
"Although we don't play anything, we can at least step on the rubber with the certainty that the Denver audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I've ever faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to let Scherzer throw into that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, did a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
The history of Washington’s right hand is 18 victories and 7 defeats, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Trump holds a meeting in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, talking about the importance of Republican participation in mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections in our lives.
It’s one of the most important. I don’t present myself, but it’s a race, so I’m going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates,” he said.
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see meekness, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to pass over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“We’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, saying the Democrats were “angry, they were bad, horrible, and false.”
He referred to the Senate Judicial Commission by appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the public's abuges.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I'm waiting for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of views.
It is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, I was barely surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of members of the Labour Party Parliament who are told not to be welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment to be categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security policy, on Europe, and it is ironic that these were matters in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a parliamentary member of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "friendlyer and kinder" policy is already more than forgotten, if it really applied at some point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that disagreeing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged based on whether or not the party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he once thought he shared a similar political view began to hope that he would radically change his mind and take stances he would never have agreed with, either on national security or the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak in public, regardless of what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments on me tend to be politicians.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never flee.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn stated that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of views and, with every “censorship” motion or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have received many advice that recommended keeping my head down and not making me hear so much and that it would be "well."
But I didn’t get into politics to do that.
Since 32 years ago I joined the Labour Party as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my integral school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those in need, whether as councillor or as government minister.
I have never concealed my political ideas, neither in the last elections.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to disregard my political stances or the areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader when the country heads to a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the electors, whether they are of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no withdrawal threat or political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an unbeaten Ayr climbs to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the match may have decided to some extent the final result, but, without a doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership day game.
They now head the table and are the only undefeated team of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to better take advantage of the opportunities, that gave the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had all the right to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in all matches and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to rejoice,” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, commented: “The Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, set the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, the Warriors' loan for the match, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage from the opponent and Jason Baggot got an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo extended the Ayr's advantage with a penalty. Before, just in the mid-time, he scored and turned a solo rehearsal, leaving the score at 17-5 in favor of Ayr in the rest.
However, the Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, whom they had to pull out on a cradle, and, with the resumption of the game, the Ayr advanced with a Stafford McDowall essay converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to take advantage of having one more man with an unconverted essay of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson for scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made a rehearsal when he was in the back of the moul that was moving forward.
Climo converted him, as he had been doing almost since the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent the wing Gregor Henry to the bottom to get the fifth rehearsal of the locals.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the protagonist of Still Game, seems determined to move to the catering sector after revealing that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, who writes and co-stars with his many-year-old comedy mate, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a Scottish Sun source pointed out that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flowering catering market".
"The sea belongs to us": a coastless Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings waves marine blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by law,
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly recall the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict for resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the yearning to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia expects a resolution from the International Court of Justice for October one, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, it is waiting for the outcome with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens spread across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will have an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is fighting a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice came only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, it may have stunned it over the past four years.
“The sea access problem has been kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Moreover, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use the maritime theme as a political crutch.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he said.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless you can trust the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come at the time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume paralyzed diplomatic talks on nuclear matter more than three months after this summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that continuing continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War to subdue the North, is a "quimera."
Washington is reluctant to accept the statement without Pyongyang first making any significant disarmament move.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s seriousness of giving up an arsenal that the country likely considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the last line of huge hats that are about to land on a shop street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, don’t look anymore.
Valentino and Thom Browne’s designers presented a set of eccentric large-sized hats for their spring summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzling the style of the Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their spectacular creations to the gateway.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other large additions were watermelons with jewelry, a witch hat and even an ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter more than high sewing.
One creation reminded a complete dive team, snorkeling and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you’re lucky.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to be seen on the streets of shops.
The big hats come strongly trampling by hand from "The Bomb", with a straw hat with a wing of over 60 centimeters worn by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this hat so unpractical that it flooded social media presented another great creation on the gateway: a straw beach bag as big as the model in swimsuit wearing it.
The dark orange raphia bag, decorated with raphia frills and a white leather handle, was the main piece of the La Riviera de Jacquemus collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at the Paris Fashion Week.
As famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental to citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a career of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in exams that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes harvested in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it reaches his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the qualifying tables, with the highest rates of approvals in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages earned an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS centres, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages by considering them a fundamental competence that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, it is considered that as a subject, languages are at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent colleges and everywhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills revealed that, among the reasons given by employers about the difficulties they encountered in filling jobs, 17 per cent were attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
Potential job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
The fact of being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically ahead of the competition.
According to a survey by YouGov of over 4000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and it was found that the only two-digit language spoken, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centers will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in the independent schools, you will always be able to choose from several languages taught by teaching staff specialized in this subject.
Scotland’s independent schools devote all of their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed, whatever the future owes them.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Fans waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers are about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
However, there is still to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted in a tweet that James was likely to play a limited few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game pre-season program.
“At this stage of my career I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump's West Virginia Meeting, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five scheduled meetings for next week, including stops at supporting locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation vote to fill the vacancy of the Supreme Court waiting, Trump intends to get support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing Congressional control when votes are deposited in November.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, which strained over allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct and have left an anticipated Senate confirmation vote pending for at most a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of meetings is to help Republicans facing the November elections gain momentum.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign noted that next week’s five meetings aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans attempt to protect and enlarge the majorities they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congressional control is so crucial to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter a campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters that he did not want to give his name.
Scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena Stadium tonight’s gathering could attract “Ohio and Pennsylvania” supporters as well as have coverage in Pittsburgh media, as reported by West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in polls.
“For Morrissey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come and push him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a politologist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows they dare to fight to keep the hope alive in the face of Sunday’s individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The impulse oscillating pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players truly believe in it, even more in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum is now?
"We were six points ahead and now we have four, so I guess that can be considered a little boost," Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more at stake.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel that they have some wind in favor and motives to be encouraged, among other reasons for the couple formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and got three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The guttural screams of celebration rose in volume as his round advanced, introducing a putt vital to draw the fourth game when he and Thomas were going two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the match in the 15th was received with a similar scream, of those who broadcast that they believe the American team has not yet left out.
"What has to be doubling the efforts and focusing on the game," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a footprint.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup story.
The strange and adorable couple of Europe has four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way their energy flows with the bustling audience make it clear that these are the players to beat Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
Still, it is still premature to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four balls of the morning, after mating with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they failed to get out of.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch them closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the tips they give and those they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big edge face to the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe ahead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe leaves with a good edge on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 score over the United States.
The motivated duo composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two victories over a Tiger Woods in trouble, ahead of four points in the Le Golf National qualifying.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to score eight points out of Sunday’s 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to earn four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname of "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to earn four points in their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to defeat discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau for a 5-4.
Woods, who had not highlighted too much in the two games on Saturday, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes games, and seven consecutive.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be Henrik Stenson's pair in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world, respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its part.
Three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference for the Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They achieved an exciting 2-1 victory against Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the two initial holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovering from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as a trophy holder, only needs a draw to retain it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a Sunday counter-attack is beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "there's no chance" they'll unilaterally disarm first if they don't trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his distrust in the United States and that there was no chance that his country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared before the international agency’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important measures of goodwill” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling nuclear testing facilities, and committing to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we did not receive any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances there’s no chance that we will disarm ourselves first unilaterally.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints over Washington's resistance to a "phase-by-phase" denuclearization formula that rewards the country as he takes step-by-step steps, his statement is important as he did not simply reject a unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" and Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons earlier.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even by objecting to a declaration of end of war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can cause us to fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the U.S. leader to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: "If South Korea had been the interested party in denuclearization rather than the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stagnation."
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles toward US soil after the suicide-missile “evil president” Trump called Kim “rocket man.”
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in moving towards disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions were needed to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline set for this: "We can take two years, three years, or five months, no matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reported to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we make the definitive and fully verified denuclearization a reality.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programmes.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip wasn’t good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea denounced that his “demands were those of a mafia.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States implemented “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had communicated to him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to rest enough
Thanks to a new course taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing male culture of studying all night by drinking caffeine.
One professor discovered that students of the world’s number one university usually have no idea about the basic care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
Their motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
"At the end of the course, a girl approached and asked me why she just learned about this now, in her last year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of dreaming, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books that tell them about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a sleep routine.
In another section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that it is not going to change student behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know, just like anyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” said Professor Czeisler.
He stated that the culture of pride for “spending the night on a wake” still exists, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure to which students are subjected meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, which is why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
He expects the next step to be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is that students think about putting an alarm to bed and another to wake up, and that they are aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal tombs the men of Gerrard
The Rangers suffered another episode of out-of-home depression, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 loss in Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first off-home victory since February 4-1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving their team at eight Hearts points, unspoiled leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
The Menga attack occurred feel minutes before mid-time and the uninspired alignment of the Rangers wasn’t up to the height at any time.
Now, the Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, behind Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may be in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a head wound after, allegedly, someone threw an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard changed eight of the titles that won the game against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who scored a point to the Hearts last week and would have been happy with the way his very organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have scored two minutes from the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep fault for Captain Craig Halket, but his defense mate, Alan Lithgow, could only send her out by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but it seemed that there was more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized at the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian request.
The Rangers scored two goal shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely saw himself in difficulty dealing with Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's boring firing.
Although Livingston scored in the 34th minute against all forecasts, no one can deny that they deserved it for the devoted effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' deep-stop ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact, as the wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly left his line to block him.
Still, the Livingston continued to take visitors exactly to the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after the other.
Holt's could have gained more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow rematched a head corner that didn't enter.
Rangers replacement Glen Middleton claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after a clash with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked elsewhere.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and counting... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The accountant Geiger, which has since been a pillar of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Bells of Coronado", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of waves emitted by the radioactivity of minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention bearing his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” a protein common to many cancers and reinject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires the removal of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a diatribe in favor of Trump with a MAGA cap after his appearance in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was stuck in the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run for the 2020 election.
After the third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to depotricize against the Democrats and I reiterate his support for Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to a white person and he asks me how I can like Trump if he’s racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the sketch show by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judicial Committee in connection with accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's bronca to social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that he had had a bad time behind the scenes for wearing that hat.
"They got into me.
They told me not to go out with the hat on.
They fucked me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how asleep I am?" and added that he was "going to put on his superman coat, because that meant no one could tell him what he had to do.
Try it with love.”
Their comments were received by the public on at least two occasions and members of the SNL appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety.
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many when he came out on stage to sing I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most brave spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING FROM THE WOMAN."
Karen Hunter, host of an interview show, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decide not to reward someone (bought their music or clothes, or supporting their art) who I think is embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying he was now “the person previously known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been named Snoop Lion, not to forget the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then the artist previously known as Prince.
Murder attempted by stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear Monday in the Belfast Court of First Instance.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in the violent HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero stereotype, saying those screen roles often transmitted to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her castmate in Game of Thrones, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that it seems "fairly important" to address this issue.
“Personally, it seems quite important to me right now, where have we been wrong about masculinity?” he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems they see now?"
Kit believes that television can take part of responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the great questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating that it is "halo of battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard’s theatrical play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he has ever come out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in the series, so, in that sense, it has given me to my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose represented Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit’s character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic Emmy award-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these have been sexually infected, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people contracting HIV in this way has virtually decreased in its entirety, Chinese health authorities declared at a congress held in the province of Yunnan.
Each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases about 100,000 people.
Sexual HIV transmission is a serious problem in the LGTB community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGTB collective suffers great discrimination.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies have calculated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to failure to use adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denied that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican Party senators and claimed it was "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican Senators on Wikipedia’s lawmakers pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were driven by commentators and “extreme right” websites.
“Lies, lies, and more vile lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The published information allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a panel session of the Senate on allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court candidate.
The leak was made at some point after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the publications was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not at all responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"I deny this information with angryness," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that it is not the temperament necessary to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he didn’t do, he shouldn’t be angry.
He should not rebel.
You should not question the accuser's reasons.
He must keep calm and serenity.”
Fleischer seems to want to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom the detractors accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who intends to unbank Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's very serious," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “the relevant authorities and entities in charge of law enforcement of these fraudulent allegations.”
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are uncovered and that they are legally held responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English Review: Again in Action. Rowan Atkinson's Spy Parody Is Short
Now it has become a tradition to look for swings to Brexit in any new movie with a British approach. It seems that this is what it is up to do with this new release of the parodic action and comedy franchise Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this ironic self-satisfaction be about how clearly nonsense we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his jumping eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to put his feet on for the second time. Only his name already gives clues that, above all, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, he is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to waste glamur, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that touched a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, in its origin, it was based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last release, there are one or two good moments.
I loved to see Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as propellers hit the helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy jumps into sight, but the humor is quite short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that “serious” movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients without problems.
Humor seems more aimed at children than adults and, to me, the absurd misfortunes of Johnny English are not as ingenious and accurate as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all his active agents at the consternation of the agent in service, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the Prime Minister, a pompous and stubborn character who is watching his political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character that is almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spy are in danger, he will have to turn to someone who is retired.
That must be the foolish Johnny English, who now teaches in a pijo school, although he gives unofficial classes on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a rock school-like spying academy.
English is moved to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets his suffering former companion Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine doesn't take enough advantage.
So, the Batman and Robin who do things terriblely wrong in the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the dangerous claws of a tech world charismatic billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash the chaos hiding on the luxurious Volta yacht; furthermore, English becomes pure anarchy when trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
Definitely, they were thoroughly employed in that last sequence, but, as funny as it may be, the whole continues to transmit a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do genuine justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denied that it was developing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but charged five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week but charge five.
The party supposedly wants business owners to destine the savings made by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
As the sources point out, the idea would “fit” into the party’s plans and economic agenda to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
This four-day change has been supported by the Trade Union Congress as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour Party officer commented to The Sunday Times: a revision of the directive is expected by the end of the year.
“It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate in order to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its campaign for the 2017 general elections.
However, at the moment, not the entire Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and is not going to be discussed right now.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his idea of carrying out a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to retrieve powers from "anonymous directors" and "taken advantage" by companies providing public services.
The shadow minister’s plans also include the idea that current shareholders of the water companies will not regain their full stake, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to the perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers in business boards and create inclusive ownership funds to allocate 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, resulting in annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about FBI investigation around Kavanaugh and whether he could make them change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote for confirmation as Supreme Court judge for at least a week, and further raises the question whether the results that are concluded could influence any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham talk about whether the FBI could bring to light information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I was in favour of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He showed himself firm, resolved, sharp.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems invariable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and would neglect the charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it sharply," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people she named have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it managed to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star cartel gathers for an equally impressive mission: end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see how tens of thousands of people will travel to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved 12 years after reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it not more than a form of so-called “clientism,” which is called the stance we take when we think we are doing something really useful when signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have managed global leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2,250 billion people by 2030.
Earlier in 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its shares, of which at least $10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that secured funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is “The Power of Nutrition”, a UK-based investor and executive association united with the joint commitment to “help children grow and develop to their full potential” and to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country’s malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens collaborators.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens partners like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of the social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador to The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that, after taking more than 5,000 actions to try to improve UK nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions raised on their website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen collaborator replied, “It will be a long and hard journey and, on many occasions, we will stumble and fall.
But, as the movements for human rights and against apartheid have already achieved before, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will feature at this year’s New York event, which will be featured by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade on Russian energy exports - Interior Ministry
“If necessary,” Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including that of the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at the request of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier of Europe," he said.
Furthermore, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that the seaways remain open and, where appropriate, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is defined as the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches that Washington holds in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia basically consists in taking advantage of and replacing fuels,” he warned while pointing out that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and rely on Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To do so, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “improper” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says will turn Berlin into a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project responds solely to economic motives and is another sign of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after holding a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Energy Secretary, last September in Moscow.
The US stance has, however, been met with Germany’s rejection, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in the EU’s energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully examine the possibility of running for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she will consider joining the presidential race after the midterm election.
During a hearing in Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being posed.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally for women to be among the leaders,” The Hill said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for the presidency.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a town hall hearing and stated that "he was leading the country on the wrong path."
“I’m really worried about the harm Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke smoothly about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren stated that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
A poll was published Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters don’t believe he should run for the 2020 election.
58% of Massachusetts’ “possible” voters said the senator should not submit, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
However, 32% of respondents supported their candidature.
The survey showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidature and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible candidature for 2020 of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin Speaks Track Palin Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation my son is going through, for everything that has happened since he returned, is well known to other families who suffer from the effects of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers return to,” he told the public that he gathered at a meeting in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the big taboo no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who “return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is that respect for what his fellow soldiers and aviators, as well as all other members of the army, have given to their country.”
On Monday, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an episode of domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy denying asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a "friendly" letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum-seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the case "Grace v. Sessions" filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner “and her children, who are members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision taken by the Board of Migration Appeals (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made statements Friday that the new policy “ignorates decades of international, federal and state law.”
“According to federal law, all asylum applications must be ruled out under the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae states.
Lawyers also stated in the letter that the policy denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by claiming that they often become entrepreneurs more frequently and "suppose a necessary labor force."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin on grounds of persecution or threats on grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion may apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, faced daily by people around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of dead increases in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly nefarious.
"The situation is very tense," Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her baby with a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to seek out among the few neglected belongings left to them in an effort to recover as much as possible.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building because of the ongoing replicas, also very strong.
He couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he lived while on the fifth floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the ruined wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, and he and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page announcement in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the payment supplement of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6 Congressional elections, something China strongly denies.
Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign launched by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish announcements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels on imports from both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs that applied to the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall back on exporters from states like Iowa, which supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, which is one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, China “is further intensifying that pressure with advertising publications in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the precious American tradition of free speech and free press by trying to publish a paying announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few disagreeing voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China can have about the worrying trajectory that the economy of their country is taking, as the media is controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most relevant newspapers has eluded the offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was about.
Analysts note Republicans are distancing themselves from women ahead of midterm vote with Kavanaugh’s debacle
As many renowned Republicans are closing rows in favour of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various accusations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a setback may occur, especially by women, in the upcoming votes held in the middle of the legislature.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have expressed that they want to move forward with the vote.
"In this kind of affairs it is not possible to back off," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill in an article that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to stand in favor of the FBI’s investigation would be enough to calm down disgusted voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters gathering at the doors of the Senate sang "November is coming!" (November will arrive soon!) as Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, the Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is out of any prognosis," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the impact is already very relevant and, indeed, it is.
But it could be even older, especially among indecisive women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18-29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony in which he detailed his accusations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that a setback could occur if the Republicans continued with the confirmation.
“This matter has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s no longer just a matter of committee voting or final voting, not even whether they’re sitting on the bench for Kavanaugh; it’s also a matter of how Republicans have handled all of this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, told news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don’t know who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, although a few more are on the side of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony definitely or likely, while 35% claim to believe Kavanaugh definitely or likely.
Moreover, 38% claimed that they believed that Kavanaugh, with all likelihood or definitely, lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's statements, as well as at least those of another complainant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at the age of 17.
For his part, Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that is trying to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project of the technology legend, a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked saying that the intention behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“It has to be now,” he said about the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology so users can create their own “online personal data storage” or a POD.
It can contain lists, pending task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
Something that is unique in personal online data storage is that it is the user who decides completely who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that purchased IBM, some of the staffed developers who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers from around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not a radical change will be introduced where all his business models are completely modified from day to day.
"We're not going to ask for permission."
In a publication on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on network neutrality.
Despite even being launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won this award on September 29, 1918 in the Bellenglise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had been awarded the greatest British military honour.
On Saturday, her two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann guided his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Channel "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons."
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage," advanced the line before reaching a single-handed cannon and throwing down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, only a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said the actions his grandfather carried out were "so big that I will never be able to reach his height, but they were very cheerful."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which was involved by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade," adding that "the value of an authentic hero becomes apparent when shown such a large backing."
MMA fans were awake all night for Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine staying awake all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so you won’t be allowed to see the main event in the end.
The San Jose poster had 13 fights, six included on the main card, and in the UK it was to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were astonished when the show changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after they had to stay awake until early in the morning just to watch the fight.
A follower on Twitter described the shift to cartoons as “a heavy joke.”
“There’s a government regulation that regulates content that is broadcast from 6 a.m. and that wasn’t suitable, so they had to switch to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the streaming.
"Peppa the pork, yes."
Bellator Chairman Scott Coker said they will modify the show to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
“When I think of the broadcast option, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn’t do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're seeing how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time it will not happen.
We’ll reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are normally the ones we’ve done. We’re trying to offer more than usual so the fans were happy and spent.
This is a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior for his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a triumphant.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he came to high school that “not everyone was like me.”
In Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs show, Lauren Laverne said her intention in talking about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to others.
He also told us that becoming a father started to undermine the importance of winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this mythical show, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months from illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, said he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially accepted that you liked boys and girls."
He said, “Until today, that feeling of inferiority and being different has really given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-bronze medals winner at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games held in Australia to claim more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to pass on that "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married last year the Oscar winner, who took him 20 years, while specifying that the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you’ve lived so much since you’ve been so young” (he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global perspective" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, all the answers would have revolved around 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is undoubtedly Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked was if they had the London 2012 pass because he wanted to be in front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wasn’t going to be in the front row,” he said.
“It was his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that exact moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that’s what I’d dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine at an Olympic game, there was nothing better,” he said.
This was also the fact that inspired him when choosing his first song, Pride of Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low shape, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to reverse his shape if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years to score a record for the 12th time, was dumped by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to content himself with animating at some moments and, at others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of the drivers, even at the highest moment of his career, the 48-year-old player is not in his best form for the Le Golf National field, where the rough long continuously punishes with mistakes.
And, if the field is no longer discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 individual games, started in an impressive way, Mickelson's game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, nor could he say much more.
“He perfectly understood the role he had today, knocked me in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t imagine it playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's mark of more games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the last in an entire Ryder Cup trajectory that had never equated the levels of its individual brand so clearly.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 lost and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought much more intangible values to the team.
“It’s funny, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to laugh at others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
“I think younger players enjoyed having it as their support, also this week; it was fun.
It’s more than just playing.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows leadership could disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last few days of the Ryder Cup, you can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish the others by stopping their heels for a minimum margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You don’t stop remembering that we did a great tournament in Valderrama; we also did it in Brookline and we lost, we did it in Valderrama and we won, but for very little,” Bjorn, portrayed, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead him with a 10-6 in Le Golf National.
The story will teach me and everyone that this team isn’t finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the scorecard.
We have one goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that’s the only thing we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what’s on the other side where they are, no more or less, than the best players in the world.”
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I wouldn't want to go ahead.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, you put all your ability as a golfer to the test.
That’s the message we need to convey to the players, to get the best out of ourselves tomorrow.
Now it’s up to leave your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do it better individually than they did as couples, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
The same Furyk has been at both ends in the last few days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team he won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Minannah Miracle".
"I remember every word," he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
“We have 12 super-important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and got them out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
"I went with this group of boys in this order because I think they cover the entire route," Bjorn said about his individual teams.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old ships of the Cold War era, but it will not be done until at least next year due to faulty systems and the progressive rise in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship leading the new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit a statement by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery messed up the completion of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships requested by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies such as very low radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the ongoing delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project their power overseas) to be already outdated when they start to serve, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 fregate held headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known of the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent to a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – half the staff that was on the former Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has excessive overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future updates.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also been a problem.
It is believed to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), rather than the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new fregates are of particular relevance in the light of the recent warnings arising about the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is "without ships capable of deploying."
The officer said the problem has worsened over time, because the old ships were dropped, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spy on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been conducted in a state of the Scottish Highlands, attempts to discover how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
Anything discovered is expected to shed more light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and help guide upcoming conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bats and sopranos, as well as Daubenton riverside bats and long-eared browns from the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in strategic locations of the property to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of bat calls and what species do.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
NTS Nature Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar expects the results to reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
They are under threat by the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cat attacks.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the subject of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the field, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues.
The organization has even inaugurated the first and only reserve dedicated to Scotland bats in the state of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats.
The property director, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave, we have a fantastic bat area," he said.
“We have ancient buildings, many veteran trees and all the right habitat.
However, there remains a lot of unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking if there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as a breeding colony can be unintentionally destroyed and 400 females and offspring could be killed, which would mean to annihilate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers pursue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has catalogued allegations of rape as “fake news,” saying people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of having paid him $375,000 to hide the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already accumulated 142 million followers a few hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, called the report “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they’ve said today is false,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner looking at the camera.
“They only want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same usual story.
They want to become famous by just mentioning me, but that's what I can't help.
I'm a happy man and everything's okay," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the accusations they have called “an inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will try to get compensation for “moral damage for an amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident appears to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly raped it annually, according to documents recorded at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99 percent” a “good boy” and that he had disappointed that “one percent” remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consented.
Mayorga also claims he went to the police and took photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to reach an extrajudicial settlement because he had "terror of retaliation" and was concerned "being humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old says she is trying to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged assault occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has changed to Juve, a big Italian football player for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK “would regret its entire life” if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily stopped at its Burnaston factory near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said the repercussion that customs delays would have in the event of a Brexit without a deal could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain breaks up with the EU by the end of March, there will be production stoppages at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have shown their fears about leaving the EU without a deal, especially with regard to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns automakers refer to revolve around the problems that could arise in assembly chains in the event of an undealed Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the adjusted “just in time” mode, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to manufacture custom cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be a border disruption that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and parts depletion.
For Toyota it would be impossible to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day of inventory at its plant in Derbyshire, the company said, and in such a case production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said May’s Chequers plan, where future relations with the EU are established, is “precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at border crossings.”
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to take the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today.
“Toyota’s evidence, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would be stopped, but warned that, in the long run, added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the manager of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: "We have put in place a precise and convincing plan that will define our future relations with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “postpone another week,” as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian elections, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation of whether Trump decides to dismiss the Deputy Attorney General or not and thereby compromising Mueller’s independence has fed Washington’s chillings for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he held with Trump with a microphone he himself wore to try to relegate the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, among news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was at the time at the United Nations in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “not” fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the vote of the Senate plenary.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said, “No date has been set, it could be this week or another could be postponed, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We’ll decide on the move and I’ll inform the press, as I usually do.”
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Speaker Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences was not due to an aversion to TV journalists acting grandiloquently, although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they boast."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more questions and answers sessions than any other president before him," he said, while quoting without evidence: "We have contrasted those numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the option to ask directly the president of the United States, I think it’s much better to do it to me.
We tried to do it many times and you have seen us do it many times in recent weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump usually answers questions when leaving the White House or when he participates in public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences with him only occur on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why it was so, where he made a loose appearance and, sometimes bizarre, before the journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of State of Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and its desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of applying for citizenship for EU members working in public services that are not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit have been followed by opting to make the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario where there would be no agreement.
I know all this must be very confusing for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that reinforce and improve the work of the health service, which benefits patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to keep counting on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is under emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie was emergency surgery after suffering a head injury last Saturday when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the band and collapsed right there," Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing it on a cradle and taking him to examine in depth.
A Tennessee State staff member told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a sophomore redshirt, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with a total of 18 in the entire season.
Foreigners will be charged a higher estate transfer tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreigners will be charged a higher estate transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money collected with this measure will be used to provide shelter to the “homeless,” according to new plans by the conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in property transfer tax will be imposed on people who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to be allocated to the “homeless”
The additional money raised with the increase in the transfer tax from land to foreign real estate buyers in the UK will go to aid to the “homeless,” Theresa May announced today.
The move is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and harassing voters to those with higher incomes.
The increase in property transfer tax will be taxed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be intended to incentivize government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s newly built properties are purchased by non-UK residents, causing rising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the wealthiest parts of the country (especially in the capital) have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the transmission tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large builders of maintaining very high prices on properties by eagerly buying land without intention to use it, and urged Ms. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "disgracious housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of evictions for no reason.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new housing.
May said, “Last year I said I would devote my position as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means fixing the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people not living in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
The dream of having a home has become too difficult to achieve for many people and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street remains too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland coach says his "primary goal" is to become a Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scotlander is enthusiastic about the possibility of revitalizing the club of the Northeast, which currently occupies third place in the League One (England’s third league division), at three points from the first.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B-cap,” Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it’s something that has always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland leader include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic says he felt no fear when he moved to such established names in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
Because the structure and facilities of this club doubtless correspond to those of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I’ve achieved my goal here when I can return the club to where it should be.”
Ross has only been training for three years, after a while as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts Technical Corps.
Later, he helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made the St. Mirren move from being on the brink of the descent to winning the championship in the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled, referring to when he took over the Alloa.
"I always thought direction was the best thing for me, much more than playing.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I was able to earn a living very well with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer the stress and pressure of that work; however, I feel good in the direction.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do it, it’s the time of my adult life that I’ve felt better, without a doubt.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pinta is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heat wave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but has concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, while earnings from restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consulting firm, who was responsible for collecting the figures, commented: “The heat of these days and the fact that England remains in the World Cup have still made the pattern of the previous month in June, in which pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, while restaurants have fallen even a bit more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurants’ commercial activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly serve drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, in which they decreased profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from the heat, although not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, drink sales rose to 6.6% over the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, of the hospitality and leisure analysts at RSM, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since late April.
The time and impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the off-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be particularly painful in view of ongoing cost pressures.
The long and hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food operators and the weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
At Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK’s restaurant, bar and pub sector, performance data from 47 operating groups are collected and analyzed, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
The survey, conducted in 20,000 high school students, revealed growth in fake Instagram pages
News have intensified fears of sexual content being posted
20% of students claimed to have a "main" account showing their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth experienced in fake Instagram accounts, a reference photo sharing site.
News has sharpened fears of sexual content being posted.
20% of students said they had a healthy "main" account they showed their parents, while they had other private accounts.
A mother who accidentally encountered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter saw a teenager encouraging others to "rape me."
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create internet spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish Athletics Federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be part of the directive of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the management body.
Doyle is the most award-winning athlete in Scotland and her president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who pretend to benefit from her great international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously by having it in its board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I like to be the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine if I would recover or to what extent I would recover.
It has been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!”
The advertisement of the squat where mothers are compared with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A cowboy company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares mothers who breastfeed with cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what in theory is the world’s “first silent squirrels,” consumer technology company Elvie released an announcement inspired by a video with somewhat ironic music showing mothers who tell them the freedom that the new milk extractor gives them.
Four real women dance in a barn filled with hay as a dance floor, along with some cows, with lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself alone, but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed it, they're not ubres, they're my breasts."
The choir continues to say, "Orden them, milk them, I am feeding their babies, milk them, milk them, I am milking my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created great controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the “horrors” of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to become pregnant before giving birth in order to produce milk, except that they take away their babies days after giving birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor fits discreetly in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?”
Another comment was: "Go a crazier advertisement."
However, others defended the announcement, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "dawning."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I still breastfeed, I'm sure I'd have one.
Using the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit crazy, but I don't turn around anymore.
It’s a product genius,” one woman told us.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use a breastfeeding pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who pull out their milk with the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no wires or tubes, and it fits discreetly inside the breastfeeding bra, which makes it possible for its users to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump in operation.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD, comments: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
In showing the parallel between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of breastfeeding pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in a fun and near way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new bomb.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb appears in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two marched along the gateway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of minor migrants displaced discreetly to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained minor migrants has experienced a considerable increase, despite the fact that monthly inflows on the border have been practically maintained at the usual levels, partly because the hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most sponsors, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to welcome a child would endanger their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer at the Immigration and Customs Office, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80% of sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute minors as soon as possible, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear before the court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the earlier rule, according to reception workers.
Many of them will testify by video conference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before a judge for immigration matters.
Those not deemed fit for protection shall be deported as soon as possible.
According to hospital workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent seizures or attempts to flee.
According to the advocates, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as the one in Tornillo, where, due to its size, the signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked.
In addition, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to emotionally prepare them or say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on US, France and Turkey 'occupy forces' to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the country’s war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “fighting in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syria’s Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the right conditions were given for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "sowing irrational fears" that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent deal between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the deal had "clear deadlines" and has expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters (linked to al-Qaeda), who "will be eradicated."
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, a dismissal or scandal end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!"
There are currently no signs of fatigue in spectators.
Since 2014, indexes reached in top audience hours have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and have virtually tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on top audience schedule, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded cable channel index with 3.5 million viewers for major night news shows.
“It’s a strange attraction that we can’t yet understand,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of Designated Survivor, a dramatic ABC series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
He remembers a taxi trip he made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” was the answer Scovell received.
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike everything else you see on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families can come together, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, information exceeds the limits when you realize that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of the “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather hunter (“an oversized pride garment,” in the words of The Washington Post) and the implications of the cab.
As far as I’m concerned, I’ll never see Super Mario again the same way.
“By offering something new every night, it’s partly what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of ‘Pawn Stars’, when he tells us about the alternate distribution of Trump’s show and his daily plot twists (either entering a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to stay behind.
When I went to talk with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not take off from the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judicial Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on a thread.
“I remember when in those days we did all those crazy programs and people told us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss tells me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

External money flows in House of Representatives’ tighter midterm elections
It’s no surprise the money inflow that is reaching Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburg, whose structure was recently redesigned, has Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s former 12th District, a district that overlaps largely with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has triggered a funding contest for campaigns among the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight advantage.
The U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, although after rejection
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection on the part of Washington.
Trump had a kind meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization’s administration team.
State Department officials decided to return heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of around $140 million in 2017 for, among other matters, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings advanced, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was to continue the conference, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is planning to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, diplomats say, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three US envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next planned step could be special attorney Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also leading this investigation into the possibility that Trump’s campaign would work in parallel with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to run again before voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditional, and with this I do not suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, only the West had to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump dismiss Vice Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mueller’s investigation fate?
Rosenstein has seen himself in a good one since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his inability to take office.
Rosenstein says The Times’ explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will be accountable to Trump?
If we fail these tests, we will encounter a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles at the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimist against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play at home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will place them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from achieving his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a trampoline for bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and we went out with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved the victory in the end, but, overall, the draw was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for all and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult match because they have already achieved a good result in the previous match, but with the entire audience supporting us, I am sure that we can move forward and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now we see an overall atmosphere that everything will go well.
The team is fine, the boys are enjoying a lot and we are having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind last season and achieve success.”
Fear of retirement savings is causing some women to lose sleep
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their relatives.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide life insurance company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in advance enough.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to get care, as those options can be a cost-determining factor.
Incorporate your financial advisor into the conversion, as it can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-valued hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or secure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: go ahead of legal battles.
Make sure you get a health care power to designate a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals fulfil their own wishes in case you can’t communicate.
You can also prepare a notarial power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your invoices are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the little details: imagine your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that you are always up to date.
"It's not just finance that's at stake: what doctors to deal with?" asks Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything needs to be planned.”
Man with a carabine shot several times in Ilfracombe
They have shot a man with a carabine several times as he walked home after going out at night.
The victim, a 40-year-old man, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (British time), as a "random act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
Their injuries are not deadly and the police appealed to potential witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, officials said.
With communications blocked, assistance officials have not been able to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, which lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regence that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regence, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines also have their importance in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of high seismic activity, and often suffers earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province of Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, provoked a tsunami on 26 December that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of deadly casualties on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that affected the southern coastline, with nearly 700 fatalities.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of towns and killed some 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Jaya’s regent in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalls the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it caused no tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and candidate for Vice President Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to the report published Saturday by Alaska state police.
According to the police report, when a acquaintance of him tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone off.
Palin has been decreed preventive detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held with an unsecured $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, the chain reported.
Palin faces three class A minor crimes, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B minor offence, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic aggression, interfering in the allegation of a domestic violence offence and possessing a drunken weapon in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed she struck her in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior with the post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck Indonesian island Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami arrived on the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Exceptionally Seek Death Penalty for Suspected of Terrorist Attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental van from Home Depot to carry out a bike lane attack last October on the West Side motorway of Lower Manhattan, killing down the pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed all eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries, in accordance with the notice of the intent to request a death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges involve a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a major federal jury filed Saipov with 22 charges including eight charges of murder with aid of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," according to prosecutors, who described how Saipov carried out it as "great, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal New York case was Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953, after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good for what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be lifted in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense lawyers representing Saipov, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty statement with a life sentence without a possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
MEP Tory says Nigel Farage should take care of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the popular army” today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the warmth" of Eurosceptics, while one of May's deputies suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham concentration that the UK "would have left" if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge that Prime Minister May faces to reconcile her divided ranks has highlighted even more when a group of Tories in favour of permanence have joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep up the compromise plan that was signed in Chequers amid attacks by Brexit-proponents, their opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the “chaos.”
Bone said at Leave Means Leave in Solihull he wanted to reject Chequers’ plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a responsible position in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have left," he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the European Union is completely false."
The pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the concentration, where she told reporters, "I only say one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public doesn’t like Chequers’ plan, the opposition isn’t going to vote in favor and isn’t popular among our party and our activists, who are the ones who actually go out on the streets and vote for us first.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to May, he added: “Prime Ministers retain their positions when they fulfil their promises.”
Farage told the concentrates that politicians should be "feeled the heat" if they were seen to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we’re not going to let them get away with theirs.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We will mobilize this country’s popular army that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of stay crossed the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour meeting in the city center.
Some activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labourist Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party application during the conference opening.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can implement computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren considers all the possibilities of running for the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all the chances of running for the presidency" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it’s time for women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes a woman at the top.
One arrested for gun murder of LSU Sims player
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot near Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head that eventually resulted in his death," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the crime scene, possessing a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.
Sims, a 1.98-meter-high Baton Rouge player, played 32 games last season, holding 10 of them, and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders hand him over victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton to forget by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into boxing and let Hamilton run in the group's queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went out forcefully one lap later and stood behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after an action with near-stick wheels that made the Ferrari driver unwillingly stop the free interior at risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and got in seventh place at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race as he clinged to his tires to achieve a fast finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered boxing in lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by recovering Raikkonen from fourth place.
It has been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman letting me in.
The team has done an exceptional job to get a perfect couple,” Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a gathering on Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she accused Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting, and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and the good thing that’s happening these last days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting, and false,” he said.
"When you read the posts and leaks, and then they say, 'But if I didn't.
I didn't."
Remember it?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... Did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn't filter it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak...? No, we didn’t leak it,” he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal didn’t seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s gathering commented, “I’ll tell you one thing: that has been really bad body language.”
Maybe she didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with improper sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and repulsion, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to hit to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the back game Saturday 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial two-goal edge thanks to the attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie won the local tie before Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
François Bouchard matched for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This has been the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe’s men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal arrived in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an attendance from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assistance so that Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively starting period, Sullivan put the local team back eager to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to match the match in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second night goal at the end of the first part.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the game with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second part and secured the victory with his team's fifth goal at the close.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies so hundreds of people can escape on the plane from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being acclaimed as a hero after dying after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and there are many missing after a large-scale earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to beat the area and many are trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Even though his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, which was being affected by a strong swing.
He stood firm to make sure that Batik Air flight 6321, which was on the track at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian channel ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts are broken by hearing this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of victims is believed to continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and many people have not been contacted,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been beaten earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says one man has disappeared after air crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared after saying the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated the plane that was sinking safely.
Air Niugini said in a statement that a male passenger could not be noticed since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been moved to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the landing track.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane fell very low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes says he and other travelers managed to move forward by a water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said the flight attendants paniced and screamed, and he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were doing a dock improvement work nearby also helped in the rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank some 30 meters underwater.
Data from the aviation security network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor's office ended the presentation of his arguments Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He exposed to the jury how he used the cell phone records to chain the moves of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, thus contradicting her previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers' phone during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford climbed the deck on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's van that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my van was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
The cell phone records indicated that they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be in the hands of the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop has departed from its origins of political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent revival in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York City nanny sues couple for firing her after "racist" text
A New York nanny is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after wrongly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the lawsuit to a “extortion” case.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed dismay when she discovered that the new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived at her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her paw sticking, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that her former nanny, who was an African-American, had done a bad job and instead was waiting for a Philippine, as stated in the New York Post.
Maurice received the pay for the day’s work and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for a dismissal compensation with the intention of receiving a $350 a day compensation for the six-month domestic work position for which he had been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show you that things aren't done like that," he told The Post on Friday, adding that "I know it's a case of discrimination."
The couple responded to claims that they were racist saying the termination of Maurice’s employment was most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife had sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We’re not racists,” Joel Plasco, husband, told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone to whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit as a “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going for someone that way?
That’s not that it’s a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public opinion court has hurried to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a speaking bear, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It was difficult to get in the place of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s funny to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had previously worked from the BBC's camera, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of publishing the books was somewhat "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a very quiet man and he didn’t like to boast,” he said.
“But since Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who accomplishes something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was urgently moved to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that the situation was really bad, that it was not expected to succeed,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I received a call from Nad to tell me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping slowly exhausted and left his system.
She had died before time and everything was going off.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stand firm.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, alien to the terrible experience that was going on.
"Nobody knew," he said.
“I bowed my head and my tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to prevent suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile illuminated anywhere.”
However, he left work before dying, as he was "in a really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the one who found him after taking his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I am constantly concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards “so that people know there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you’re a friend.
Don’t sit silent, you have to talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Davies' friend for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or anything like that," he says.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas came to its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death was a big trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: "Leave a void in the whole family.
He left us shattered.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs on a thread as the FBI begins the investigation
“I thought if we really could get something like what I was asking for (a time-limited, limited-range investigation), maybe we could bring a bit of unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be “going to peak” amid a partisan paralysis.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigation?
Their refusal is entirely due to chronology.
Only five weeks are left for the midterm elections, on November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans get poor results, their attempts to achieve the election of the man they want for the country’s highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling on the senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President’s personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI publishes your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the draw and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's desert figures "fall" with Kim
The number of deserters from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and high tariffs charged by human traffickers have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made public comments on this.
The vast majority of Northern deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strongly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
North-South relations, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who generally agreed to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for lack of progress.
“Without US confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will in no way be the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, said the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysteric" and was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t stop thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she’s a hysterical woman,” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used the excitement to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned the Democrats, calling the accusations against him “grotescous and clearly coordinated defamations” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in case he was confirmed in office and the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m just going to say one thing: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not going to be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, he’s not going to even be fit to be in the court where he is now exercising,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible judgments against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would nullify certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to feel that everything is okay,” Pelosi said.
And women have to push him.
It's justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and she can't let go of it without crying.
“We cry when we got angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's so weird, is it?"
She continued, “I was very helpful by a woman who was executive at some company and who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique for which when she was angry and started crying, I was telling the person she was talking to, “Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
Well, no, I'm angry."
And then I continued with what I was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, was once I found myself crying with an inexpressible anger. A older woman, a serious manager who had always had a slight fear of, grabbed me by the gout and dragged me to a staircase.
“Don’t let them ever see you cry,” he said.
“They have no idea that you are angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they think you've been stuck."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Colorado Democratic congresswoman, had worked with Gary Hart in her presidential careers.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to withdraw from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, came to her mind that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she would run for president.
“It wasn’t a well-meditated decision,” he laughed 30 years later.
“There were seven candidates in the career and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the campaign was already very advanced, it remained behind in the fundraising, so it was promised that it would not return to the race unless it raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she gave her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration for a system that hindered fundraising and focused on voter rather than delegates, and anger at sexism) that she was stifled.
"The logical thing would have been to think he had a nervous crisis," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction of the press.
“You could have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember I was thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"He cried?"
China-U.S. trade war could benefit Beijing
The first rescues from the U.S.-China trade war were deceitful, and while there is still much left for the battle to end, a break between countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in goods, which taxes half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent retaliation, recently applying tariffs of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to equal US attacks, and it is unlikely that the world’s second most powerful economy will soon loosen.
Achieving Washington to step back would mean giving in to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can bring the conditions to initiate a crash in the economy in either of the two countries is actually far more dangerous than viewers have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused partner researcher for the Center for New American Security strategic cabinet.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been over seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave it due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are already met.
The UN estimates that, since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country and in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also emphasized that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris (France).
The United States now has six consecutive defeats on European soil since last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water at hole 16 pair 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth defeated 5 and 4 against the European team's lowest ranking player, the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
World number one player Dustin Johnson dropped 2-1 against Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories in the tournament of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help.
It has been a very tough year.
I am totally grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to get the cup back.
It’s a achievement for the entire team and I’m very happy to have been able to help,” said Garcia after the European team’s victory.
Now the torch is passed to his fellow countryman John Rahm, who already defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday for 2 and 1 in an individual match.
“I feel incredible pride in beating Tiger Woods as I grew up seeing this man,” said 23-year-old John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, leaving behind Jack Nicklaus alone.
The U.S. team had to fight for the whole weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m very proud of these guys, they never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed up the situation in Europe.
But we spoiled it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We will regroup, I will meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move on.
I love these 12 boys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it's up to us to tilt our heads.
They have overcome us.”
